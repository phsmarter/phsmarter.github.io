Constructions of aquaculture facilities involve many procedures and activities, withspecific requirements depending on the type of aquaculture facility7. In implementing a project, program of work will be the basis before doing a work8. To compute the labor cost, daily labor requirements plus duration multiplied byrate/day9. Total cost will be computed, quantity divided by unit cost10. Grant total is the summation of all total cost.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park is approximately 15,291.59 square meters.</p><p>2. So, the amount of fencing material required to surround the pond is 9π meters, and the area of the pond is approximately 20.25π square meters.</p><p>3. The area of the space where the drum stands is approximately 17,671 square centimeters.</p><p></p><p>As for numbers 4 and 5 I can't completely calculate it. Since it lacks the corresponding input and the words are jumbling. </p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. To calculate the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park, we need to subtract the area of the circular fountain from the area of the circular park. The radius of the circular fountain is given as 5 m, and the radius of the circular park is given as 70 m.</p><p>The area of the circular fountain is:</p><p>πr^2 = π(5)^2 = 25π</p><p>The area of the circular park is:</p><p>πr^2 = π(70)^2 = 4900π</p><p>Therefore, the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park is:</p><p>4900π - 25π = 4875π</p><p>This simplifies approximately 15,291.59 square meters. Therefore, the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park is approximately 15,291.59 square meters</p><p></p><p>2. To find the materials needed to fence around the circular pond, we need to find its circumference, which is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the pond. So, the circumference of the pond is:

</p><p>C = 2π(4.5m)
</p><p>C = 9π m

</p><p>Therefore, we need 9π meters of fencing material to fence around the pond.

</p><p>To find the area of the circular pond, we use the formula A = πr^2:

</p><p>A = π(4.5m)^2
</p><p>A = 20.25π m^2

</p><p>Therefore, the area of the circular pond is approximately 20.25π square meters.

</p><p>So, the amount of fencing material required to surround the pond is 9π meters, and the area of the pond is approximately 20.25π square meters.</p><p></p><p>3. To find the area of the space where the drum stands, we need to find the area of the circle that has a diameter of 150cm. We know that the formula for calculating the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. We can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2:

</p><p>r = 150cm / 2
</p><p>r = 75cm

</p><p>Now we can substitute the value of the radius into the formula for the area:

</p><p>A = πr^2
</p><p>A = π(75cm)^2
</p><p>A ≈ 17,671cm^2

</p><p>Therefore, the area of the space where the drum stands is approximately 17,671 square centimeters.</p><br />

                            20. 1. A circular fountain with a 5-m radius lies along the center of a circular park with a 70-m radius. Calculate the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park2. A circular pond has a radius of 4.5 m. How much materials will be needed if you plan to put a fence around it?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle:</p><p></p><p>Area = π(70^2) - π(5^2)</p><p>Area = π(4900) - π(25)</p><p>Area = 15393.16 square meters</p><p></p><p>2. To put a fence around the pond, you need to find the circumference of the pond and then multiply it by the height of the fence. The area of the pond can be found using the formula for the area of a circle:</p><p></p><p>Circumference = 2π(4.5)</p><p>Circumference = 28.27 meters</p><p></p><p>Materials needed = Circumference x Fence Height</p><p>Materials needed = 28.27 x 1 (assuming a 1-meter high fence)</p><p>Materials needed = 28.27 meters</p><p></p><p>Area of the pond = π(4.5^2)</p><p>Area of the pond = 63.62 square meters</p><p></p><p>3. The area of the space where the drum stands is the area of the circle with a diameter of 150cm:</p><p></p><p>Area = π(75^2)</p><p>Area = 17671.88 square centimeters</p><p></p><p>4. To find the amount of materials Rachel needs, we need to find the circumference of the tablecloth:</p><p></p><p>Circumference = 2π(48)</p><p>Circumference = 301.59 dm</p><p></p><p>She needs to convert decimeters to meters:</p><p></p><p>Materials needed = Circumference/10</p><p>Materials needed = 30.16 meters</p><p></p><p>5. The area of the wall occupied by the clock is the same as the area of the circle with a circumference of 75 cm:</p><p></p><p>Area = π(75/2π)^2</p><p>Area = 442.78 square centimeters</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The walking area available to pedestrians is the area of the larger circle (park) minus the area of the smaller circle (fountain). </p><p>Area of park = π(70 m)^2 = 4,900π m^2</p><p>Area of fountain = π(5 m)^2 = 25π m^2</p><p>Walking area = 4,900π m^2 - 25π m^2 = 4,875π m^2</p><p>Answer: The total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park is 4,875π m^2.</p><p>2. To find the amount of materials needed for the fence, we need to calculate the circumference of the pond and add a bit extra for overlap and gate. The area of the pond can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2.</p><p>Circumference of pond = 2π(4.5 m) = 9π m</p><p>Materials needed for fence = circumference + extra = 9π m + 1 m = 10π m</p><p>Area of pond = π(4.5 m)^2 = 20.25π m^2</p><p>Answer: Approximately 10π meters of materials will be needed for the fence and the area of the pond is 20.25π m^2.</p><p>3. The area of the space where the drum stands is just the area of the circle with diameter 150 cm.</p><p>Radius of circle = 150 cm ÷ 2 = 75 cm</p><p>Area of space = π(75 cm)^2 = 5,625π cm^2</p><p>Answer: The area of the space where the drum stands is 5,625π cm^2.</p><p>4. The length of materials needed for the circular tablecloth is the circumference of the circle. </p><p>Circumference of circle = 2π(48 dm) = 96π dm</p><p>We can convert dm to meters by dividing by 10:</p><p>96π dm = (96π/10) m = 9.6π m</p><p>Answer: Rachel will need approximately 9.6π meters of material for the circular tablecloth.</p><p>5. The area of the wall occupied by the circular clock is the same as the area of the circle with circumference 75 cm. </p><p>Radius of circle = circumference/(2π) = 75 cm/(2π) ≈ 11.94 cm</p><p>Area of circle = π(11.94 cm)^2 ≈ 448.8 cm^2</p><p>Answer: The circular clock occupies approximately 448.8 cm^2 of area on the wall.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. To calculate the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park, we need to subtract the area of the circular centerpiece from the area of the park.</p><p>The area of the circular centerpiece is calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, which is A = πr^2.</p><p></p><p>So, the area of the centerpiece is:</p><p></p><p>A = π(5)^2</p><p>A = 78.54 square meters</p><p></p><p>The area of the park is also calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, which is A = πr^2.</p><p></p><p>So, the area of the park is:</p><p></p><p>A = π(70)^2</p><p>A = 15,400 square meters</p><p></p><p>2. To calculate the total walking area available to pedestrians, we subtract the area of the centerpiece from the area of the park:</p><p></p><p>Total walking area = Area of park - Area of centerpiece</p><p>Total walking area = 15,400 - 78.54</p><p>Total walking area = 15,321.46 square meters</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total walking area available to pedestrians visiting the park is 15,321.46 square meters.</p><p></p><p>3. To calculate the amount of materials needed to put a fence around the circular pond, we need to find the circumference of the pond.</p><p>The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.</p><p></p><p>So, the circumference of the pond is:</p><p></p><p>C = 2π(4.5)</p><p>C = 28.27 meters</p><p></p><p>4. To calculate the amount of material needed, we need to multiply the circumference by the height of the fence. Let's assume the fence is 2 meters high.</p><p></p><p>Total material needed = Circumference x Fence height</p><p>Total material needed = 28.27 x 2</p><p>Total material needed = 56.54 square meters</p><p></p><p>Therefore, you would need 56.54 square meters of materials to put a fence around the circular pond.</p><p></p><p>The area of the pond can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, which is A = πr^2.</p><p></p><p>So, the area of the pond is:</p><p></p><p>A = π(4.5)^2</p><p>A = 63.62 square meters</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the area of the pond is 63.62 square meters.</p><p></p><p>The diameter of the drum is 150 centimeters. To find the area of the space where the drum stands, we need to find the area of the circle with a diameter of 150 centimeters.</p><p>The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, so:</p><p></p><p>r = 150/2</p><p>r = 75 centimeters</p><p></p><p>The area of the circle is calculated using the formula A = πr^2:</p><p></p><p>A = π(75)^2</p><p>A = 17,671.46 square centimeters</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the area of the space where the drum stands is 17,671.46 square centimeters.</p><p></p><p>Rachel is making a circular tablecloth with a radius of 48 decimeters. To find out how much material she will need, we need to find the circumference of the circle.</p><p>The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.</p><p></p><p>So, the circumference of the tablecloth is:</p><p></p><p>C = 2π(48)</p><p>C = 301.59 decimeters</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Rachel will need 301.59 decimeters of material to make the circular tablecloth.</p><p></p><p>A circular clock with a circumference of 75 centimeters is attached to a wall. To find out how much area of the wall it occupies, we need to find the diameter of the clock and then use the formula for the area of a circle.</p><p>The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle. We know that the circumference of the clock is 75 centimeters, so:</p><p></p><p>75 = 2πr</p><p>r = 75/(2π)</p><p>r = 11.93 centimeters</p><p></p><p>The diameter of the clock is twice the radius, so:</p><p></p><p>d = 2r</p><p>d = 2(11.93)</p><p>d = 23.86 centimeters</p><p></p><p>The area of the circle is calculated using the formula A = πr^2:</p><p></p><p>A = π(11.93)^2</p><p>A = 447.71 square centimeters</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the circular clock occupies an area of 447.71 square centimeters on the wall.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Estimation refers to scientific way of working out and preparing an approximatecomputation of the probable cost of a piece of work prepared by a person before doing a project.3. Bill of materials is an element necessary to perform a work task in relation to jobapp icants4. List of materials needed that are itemized to complete a job is called program of work5. Poor planning is the major cause of project failure that leads to personal bankruptcy6. Constructions of aquaculture facilities involve many procedures and activities, withspecific requirements depending on the type of aquaculture facility7. In implementing a project, program of work will be the basis before doing a work8. To compute the labor cost, daily labor requirements plus duration multiplied byrate/day9. Total cost will be computed, quantity divided by unit cost10. Grant total is the summation of all total cost.​</h2><br />
