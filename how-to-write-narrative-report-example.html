Then, fill in the blanks with the letters of the words from the pool of choices below to complete the passage: A. Explanatory C. Expository B. Persuasive D. Personal E Narrative I have learned in this lesson that paragraph development differs according to the purpose of the writer or the choice of text type. Let's say, if I want to convince others of my opinion or point of view, I will write a 1. text. If I want to tell a story, like those in literature, what I would write is a 2. For a 3. recount, I have to draw from my past experiences while for factual recount, this has to be something I have observed or studied with expertise. As for 4. text, this is an informative text that clearly and precisely explains the WHYs and HOWs behind a phenomenon, view, or process in an authoritative manner. That is, with supporting examples, evidence, and valid sources. Lastly, to write alan 5. paragraph, it's best to write on something I know too well, or have researched myself. Here, I will either give instructions on how something works or is done step-by-step, or simply write a report about a particular topic.​</a>

That is, with supporting examples, evidence, and valid sources. Lastly, to write alan 5. paragraph, it's best to write on something I know too well, or have researched myself.
