                                            How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</a>

                                            Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

                                            11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>ENHANCED COMMUNITY QUARANTINE<p>Opinion Essay</p><p></p>Introduction<p>Our government has declared safety measures and precautions in order just to care for the country men and to keep it safe. And we can't do anything about it. Some are babbling, ranting into social media not understanding how our Government tried to this an effort for the country. </p>Body<p>My experience during the current CoViD-19 lockdown is sorrowful. I've been having a lot of things on my mind lately, i overthink about stuffs i shouldn't. I feel sad over everything. First, I feel unhappy because I'll just be staying at home(doesn't mean i disagree about the lockdown), i won't be able to socialize and have with friends and classmates at school, you know you'll realize school is fun when it's over, but very tiring when you're on it. I feel sad I can't go wherever I wanna be and hangout with some peers anytime I want to. On my home, it feels boring. You know it because the routine keeps back like a cycle. Do the house chores, cook, eat, sleep, surf on the internet, something like that. While worrying what worst could possibly happen? Everything is cancelled, even churches. So what we did with my family we just do evening and morning devotionals, church service at home when it's sabbath day, praying for everything to stop and make it normal. Hoping every minute, everyone is safe and is able to handle anything.</p>Conclusion<p>Therefore, I could say that this enhanced community quarantine is a <strong>good </strong>decision to make for all the people. Because it ensures the safety of the people, not just that it also makes our environment less polluted because our nature is now free from all the crowd finally can breath out  through itself.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#AnswerForTrees #BrainlyLearnAtHome</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Through books, documentaries, and conversations with older generations, I developed a profound understanding of the struggles our ancestors endured to secure our freedom and independence. In a nation as diverse as ours, celebrating and embracing cultural diversity is a powerful expression of nationalism. I actively participated in cultural festivals, wearing traditional attire, learning traditional dances, and indulging in regional cuisines. These experiences not only fostered a sense of appreciation for our diverse heritage but also promoted unity among different communities, transcending any differences and forging a shared identity.</p><p></p><p>Let us stand together, young and passionate, as we encourage one another to love this nation, to strive for its progress, and to uphold the values that define us.

Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Okay I will revise your essay.</strong><p>Poverty is a complex societal issue that affects individuals, families, communities, and nations. It is defined as the inability to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and education. However, poverty is much more than just a lack of money. It is hunger, sickness, unemployment, lack of access to education and healthcare, and living one day at a time. Therefore, poverty requires urgent attention from everyone, and it is not just the problem of the poor individual, but also the entire nation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, many people have the misconception that poverty is a choice made by the poor. They believe that poor people should just work harder to improve their lives. However, this is not always the case. In many situations, the poor lack access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities, which makes it difficult for them to escape poverty. It is not fair to judge people in poverty without understanding the structural and systemic issues that contribute to their plight.</p><p></p><p>To eradicate poverty, effective measures must be implemented by the government and society at large. These measures should focus on providing access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities to the poor. The eradication of poverty is essential for sustainable and inclusive growth for people, society, country, and the economy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a societal issue that requires the attention of everyone. It is not just the problem of the poor individual, but also the entire nation.

                            8. Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During the Spanish period in the Philippines, one of the struggles experienced by the Filipinos was the loss of their cultural identity. The Spaniards imposed their language, religion, and way of life, which greatly affected the lives of the native Filipinos. They were forced to abandon their traditional practices and beliefs, and were made to conform to the ways of their colonizers.</p><p></p><p>This struggle of losing their cultural identity greatly affected the lives of the Filipinos. They felt a sense of displacement and alienation in their own land. They were made to feel inferior and ashamed of their own culture. This struggle also led to a loss of self-esteem and confidence, which hindered their progress and development as a people.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I have also experienced struggles in my life. One of the most challenging experiences was when I failed an important exam in school. It made me feel like a failure and I lost confidence in myself. However, I was able to cope with this struggle by seeking help from my teachers and studying harder. I realized that failure is not the end of the world and that I can always learn from my mistakes.</p><p></p><p>These struggles, both in the past and present, have helped me deepen my sense of nationalism. I realized that as a Filipino, it is important to preserve our cultural identity and to be proud of our heritage. As a student, I can deepen my sense of nationalism by learning more about our history and culture, participating in cultural events and activities, and promoting our local products and traditions.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the struggles experienced by the Filipinos during the Spanish period, such as the loss of their cultural identity, have greatly affected their lives. These struggles have also taught us the importance of preserving our culture and heritage. As a student, I believe that deepening our sense of nationalism is essential in promoting our country's progress and development.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the video, the Cavite Mutiny was led by Andres Bonifacio and other members of the secret society called the Katipunan. The reason behind the mutiny was their desire to seek independence from Spanish colonial rule and to establish a Philippine republic.</p><p>Essay:</p><p></p><p>The 1872 Cavite event can be seen as both a local mutiny and a national revolution. On the one hand, it was a local mutiny in the sense that it was a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule that was limited to the Cavite region. On the other hand, it can also be seen as a national revolution in the sense that it was part of a wider movement for independence that was taking place throughout the Philippines at the time.</p><p></p><p>The Cavite Mutiny is an important event in the history of the Philippines because it marked the beginning of the Philippine Revolution, which eventually led to the country's independence from Spanish colonial rule. It is also significant because it brought to light the issues of colonial oppression, exploitation, and injustice that were prevalent in the Philippines at the time, and helped to galvanize the movement for independence.</p><p></p><p>Based on the sources introduced, my understanding of the past has been enhanced by learning about the different perspectives and interpretations of the Cavite Mutiny. The sources have provided valuable insights into the motivations and goals of the revolutionaries, as well as the context in which the mutiny took place. They have also helped to shed light on the complex and multifaceted nature of the Philippine Revolution, and the many different factors that contributed to it.</p><p></p><p>For the table:</p><p></p><p>CONTENT: The main idea of the Cavite Mutiny is that it was a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule that was led by Andres Bonifacio and other members of the Katipunan.</p><p></p><p>CONTEXT: The Cavite Mutiny took place in the Cavite region of the Philippines in 1872, at a time when the country was still under Spanish colonial rule.</p><p></p><p>COMMUNICATION: The source is reliable because it is based on historical records and accounts of the event.</p><p></p><p>CREATOR: The source was created by historians who have studied the Cavite Mutiny and the Philippine Revolution.</p><p></p><p>CONNECTION: Prior to reading this source, my knowledge of the Cavite Mutiny was limited to a general understanding of its significance in the history of the Philippines. The source has provided me withmore detailed and nuanced information about the event, such as the motivations and goals of the revolutionaries, the context in which the mutiny took place, and the different perspectives and interpretations of the event.</p><p></p><p>CONCLUSION: The source has contributed to my understanding of the past by providing valuable insights into the Cavite Mutiny and the Philippine Revolution, and by helping to shed light on the complex and multifaceted nature of these events. It has also helped me to better understand the issues of colonial oppression, exploitation, and injustice that were prevalent in the Philippines at the time, and the role that the Cavite Mutiny played in the movement for independence.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Not all heroes wear capes. During the pandemic, while we were stuck in our rooms hoping to find the cure, frontliners were working 24/7 for us. Tiring and sleepless days they have gone through just for our benefit. They were sweating profusely in their medical and thick hazmat suits. Tight facemasks start to leave a mark on their faces. And having to use multiple masks, frontliners were catching up their breaths making it hard to talk. Additionally, one of their challenges was managing, not only the outbreak, but also taking care of the patients. But regardless, despite the stress, pressure, anxiousness, and tiredness, they were still determined to get the job done. And for that, they are truly the definition of modern-day heroes.</p><br />
