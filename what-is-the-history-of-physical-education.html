Pierre and Marie’s amicable collaboration later helped to unlock the secrets of the atom.Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a professor of physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French university, where she earned her master’s degree and doctorate in physics.Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many productive years working together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.Curie’s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.

                                            6 NON- SEXUAL ADVICE FOR YOUNGSTERS
Do not spend so much time trying to be more physically attractive in order to just impress your crush rather than making yourself mentally attractive.
Educate yourself , address your reccuring toxic thoughts , deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own.
That's attractive.
Normalize saying "No" without needing to over explain yourself. 
If someone is offended by your boundaries , that's their problem.
The best weight you'll ever lose is the weight of other people's opinion of you.
Don't subscribe to other people's definition of "FUN".
Fun doesn't have to mean drinking , partying and socialising.
Fun can be a night in alone , getting lost in a book , a deep conversation , a walk, creating art , playing music , or doing your work. 
FUN IS YOURS ; YOU DEFINE IT.
Before you get married 
discuss bills , parenting styles , credit , debt , how to deal with family , what belief will be installed in your children , childhood traumas , sexual expectations , partner expectations , financial expectations , family health history , bucket list , dream home , career and education , political view and whatever else come in mind. 
LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.
The age of 15-30 is golden era of your life. 
You make friends , lose them too.
You fall , you fail , you learn , you realise , you hit reality , you fall in love , you get hurt too. You lose yourself and eventually become stronger. 
Remember!
These are the best years of your life.
You should understand the difference between enjoying it and ruining it. 
Heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent.</a>

                            10. READING TEXT #1 Marie Curie was one of the most accomplished scientists in history. Together with her husband, Pierre, she discovered radium, an element widely used for treating cancer, and studied uranium and other radioactive substances. Pierre and Marie’s amicable collaboration later helped to unlock the secrets of the atom.Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a professor of physics. At an early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled, however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French university, where she earned her master’s degree and doctorate in physics.Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many productive years working together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.Curie’s feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium. Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.

                            20. 6 NON- SEXUAL ADVICE FOR YOUNGSTERS
Do not spend so much time trying to be more physically attractive in order to just impress your crush rather than making yourself mentally attractive.
Educate yourself , address your reccuring toxic thoughts , deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own.
That's attractive.
Normalize saying "No" without needing to over explain yourself. 
If someone is offended by your boundaries , that's their problem.
The best weight you'll ever lose is the weight of other people's opinion of you.
Don't subscribe to other people's definition of "FUN".
Fun doesn't have to mean drinking , partying and socialising.
Fun can be a night in alone , getting lost in a book , a deep conversation , a walk, creating art , playing music , or doing your work. 
FUN IS YOURS ; YOU DEFINE IT.
Before you get married 
discuss bills , parenting styles , credit , debt , how to deal with family , what belief will be installed in your children , childhood traumas , sexual expectations , partner expectations , financial expectations , family health history , bucket list , dream home , career and education , political view and whatever else come in mind. 
LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.
The age of 15-30 is golden era of your life. 
You make friends , lose them too.
You fall , you fail , you learn , you realise , you hit reality , you fall in love , you get hurt too. You lose yourself and eventually become stronger. 
Remember!
These are the best years of your life.
You should understand the difference between enjoying it and ruining it. 
Heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent.</h2><br />
