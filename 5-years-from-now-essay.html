Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year.

Those who refuse not to side with him will sure regret his/her ever biggest mistake of his/her life.5. Does our democracy is indeed a genuine one? Does it provide a fair and square opportunity to be heard? Does congress is really providing representation of the people from different places with different needs, interests, culture and faith? Do people beyond the poverty line are being provided the most needed attention not by the government alone but also by the entire stakeholders of the society? These questions are seeking the promptest answer from everyone. We should remember that we are all responsible to one another, as the saying states that no man is an island.6.

Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

From the presented figure, it is seen that majority of the parents do have the strongest faith and hope in education. For they all consider education to be the best game changer in life. This should serve as an eye opener to all, especially to the youths, that education should be their priority, for this is the real avenue that will lead them to success.3. MANILA, Philippines - Health Secretary Francisco Duque III is urging the public to limit their family celebrations at home with immediate family members, attend online mass services instead, and defer plans to return to their home provinces this coming Christmas and New Year.

Does it provide a fair and square opportunity to be heard? Does congress is really providing representation of the people from different places with different needs, interests, culture and faith? Do people beyond the poverty line are being provided the most needed attention not by the government alone but also by the entire stakeholders of the society? These questions are seeking the promptest answer from everyone. We should remember that we are all responsible to one another, as the saying states that no man is an island.6.
