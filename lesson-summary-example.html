Instructions: Read the Summary of Makato and the Cowrie Shell, and answer the comprehension check that follows. Complete the information using Venn Diagram. Makato and the Cowrie Shell (summary) SupanneeKhanchanathiti A young boy named Makato was an orphan, and didn't have any way to support himself, so he worked hard doing whatever jobs that he could to survive. Makato was a very hard worker, and people noticed that. He would dream of going on an adventure to a bigger place where the land was fertile and the people were kind, and he was encouraged to do that. One day, when he had prepared enough, he set out. It took him a month to get to the bigger town, and when he arrived he asked a woman for water. He told her that he had come such a long way because he wanted to see the king, who he had heard was kind. He worked with the king's elephants and he started working for her. After some time working, he did encounter the king, and during the encounter he picked up a cowrie shell that was lying on the road and offered it to the king (Cowrie shells were used for money, but just one was practically worthless). When Makato offered the shell to the King, the King said he could keep it, and so Makato pondered what he could do to honor the king's gift. He saw some lettuce seeds at a stall in the market and thought that he could grow them. He asked the woman about them, and she let him have as many as would stick to his finger in return for his treasured cowrie shell. He grew the lettuces, and next time he saw the king, he gave one to him, telling him he grew them from the shell the king had given him. The king was impressed, gave him a job in the castle, and he eventually grew up and married the daughter of the king.   Comprehension Check: Who are the main characters in the story? What is Makatos dream for his future? How did Makato impress the king? What is the moral of the story? Now, let us compare Makatos success to your own example of success using​</a>

                                            Summary of                                                Close knit family I don't view my important characteristics as different from those my family has imparted on me throughout the years. The pride, care, dedication, effort, and hard-working attitude that I view as critical to any success I may achieve have all descended upon me courtesy of my close-knit, Italian family. Born the child of two immigrants who came here with nothing, only one possessing a college degree, the importance of a good work ethic was stressed by my parents from day one. Through their actions in their jobs and through the verbal lessons on life I began to get from the moment I could communicate, they set an example for me to follow, one of being proud of what I do, no matter what it was, and above all, to care about everything I do as if everything had a big impact. This meant that everything had to be done right and be done well. Undoubtedly, following their own advice carried my parents from their status as blue-collar immigrants who labored as factory workers to white-collar citizens, one of whom owns his own business while the other works as a bank officer. Those ascensions from nothing only served as other examples for me to follow, examples that delineated the ability for a person to improve through effort. Another quotation from my father propelled me from the time I started school to today: "No matter what you do, you have to be the best." This set up the inner drive that motivates all my actions. It was what forced me to try hard in school although I didn't know English well enough to always understand the teacher. It's the reason why I have developed my skills. It accounts for my dedication to all activities, and to the hard work I put into all of them as I strive to lead both in class and out. Essentially, my parentage was the first quality that distinguished me as a leader. Despite all the talk of being a leader, I have never lost sight of the importance of my family. I know I owe my family everything, and as a result, I'll always be close with it.​</a>

                                            Lessons One Can Learn About Life from a DogThere are so many lessons one can learn about life from a dog. Imagine this scenario; it s Taining heavily oursite and you need to leave for someone's house. The dog is up and eager to 80 with you You tell it to stay home. As you leave, you see it squeezing out through the gap in the doorway. You scald it and order it back home. Then at every turn you make, you suddenly follow you sheepishly at a distance. It follows at a risk of being reprimanded for the sore reason of being somewhere nearby, How else can we experience so selfless aninstance of love and faithfulness? We can learn a lifelong lesson from this sincere warm displayof perpetual companionship.Observe the eating habit of your dog. It does not eat, except when hungry. It does notdrink, unless it is thirsty, it does not gorge Itself. It stops eating when it had enough. A dog also sets a perfect example of adaptability, if it moved to a strange place, it is able to adapt itself to that place and to its thousand peculiarities without a murmur of complaint. It is able to learn and adapt to a new family's ways and customs it is quick and ready to please Man, being accustomed to comfort and wealth will be lost if suddenly stripped of all he is accustomed to A dog also teaches us a thing or two about, unselfish love: When a dog knows death is approaching, it tries, with its last vestige of strength, to crawl away elsewhere to die, in order toburden its owners no more A dog does things with all vigor, However, when there is nothing to do, it lies down and rests, it does not waste its strength and energy needlessly. Many working people are burning the candles at both ends. Many suffer nervous breakdowns due to stress. Perhaps, they should learn to rest like a dog does.SUMMARY​</a>

                                            The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</a>

Makato and the Cowrie Shell (summary) SupanneeKhanchanathiti A young boy named Makato was an orphan, and didn't have any way to support himself, so he worked hard doing whatever jobs that he could to survive. Makato was a very hard worker, and people noticed that. He would dream of going on an adventure to a bigger place where the land was fertile and the people were kind, and he was encouraged to do that. One day, when he had prepared enough, he set out. It took him a month to get to the bigger town, and when he arrived he asked a woman for water. He told her that he had come such a long way because he wanted to see the king, who he had heard was kind. He worked with the king's elephants and he started working for her. After some time working, he did encounter the king, and during the encounter he picked up a cowrie shell that was lying on the road and offered it to the king (Cowrie shells were used for money, but just one was practically worthless). When Makato offered the shell to the King, the King said he could keep it, and so Makato pondered what he could do to honor the king's gift. He saw some lettuce seeds at a stall in the market and thought that he could grow them. He asked the woman about them, and she let him have as many as would stick to his finger in return for his treasured cowrie shell. He grew the lettuces, and next time he saw the king, he gave one to him, telling him he grew them from the shell the king had given him. The king was impressed, gave him a job in the castle, and he eventually grew up and married the daughter of the king.   Comprehension Check: Who are the main characters in the story?

Summary of                                                Close knit family I don't view my important characteristics as different from those my family has imparted on me throughout the years. The pride, care, dedication, effort, and hard-working attitude that I view as critical to any success I may achieve have all descended upon me courtesy of my close-knit, Italian family. Born the child of two immigrants who came here with nothing, only one possessing a college degree, the importance of a good work ethic was stressed by my parents from day one. Through their actions in their jobs and through the verbal lessons on life I began to get from the moment I could communicate, they set an example for me to follow, one of being proud of what I do, no matter what it was, and above all, to care about everything I do as if everything had a big impact. This meant that everything had to be done right and be done well. Undoubtedly, following their own advice carried my parents from their status as blue-collar immigrants who labored as factory workers to white-collar citizens, one of whom owns his own business while the other works as a bank officer. Those ascensions from nothing only served as other examples for me to follow, examples that delineated the ability for a person to improve through effort. Another quotation from my father propelled me from the time I started school to today: "No matter what you do, you have to be the best." This set up the inner drive that motivates all my actions. It was what forced me to try hard in school although I didn't know English well enough to always understand the teacher. It's the reason why I have developed my skills. It accounts for my dedication to all activities, and to the hard work I put into all of them as I strive to lead both in class and out. Essentially, my parentage was the first quality that distinguished me as a leader. Despite all the talk of being a leader, I have never lost sight of the importance of my family. I know I owe my family everything, and as a result, I'll always be close with it.​</h2><br />

                            17. Lessons One Can Learn About Life from a DogThere are so many lessons one can learn about life from a dog. Imagine this scenario; it s Taining heavily oursite and you need to leave for someone's house. The dog is up and eager to 80 with you You tell it to stay home. As you leave, you see it squeezing out through the gap in the doorway. You scald it and order it back home. Then at every turn you make, you suddenly follow you sheepishly at a distance. It follows at a risk of being reprimanded for the sore reason of being somewhere nearby, How else can we experience so selfless aninstance of love and faithfulness? We can learn a lifelong lesson from this sincere warm displayof perpetual companionship.Observe the eating habit of your dog. It does not eat, except when hungry. It does notdrink, unless it is thirsty, it does not gorge Itself. It stops eating when it had enough. A dog also sets a perfect example of adaptability, if it moved to a strange place, it is able to adapt itself to that place and to its thousand peculiarities without a murmur of complaint. It is able to learn and adapt to a new family's ways and customs it is quick and ready to please Man, being accustomed to comfort and wealth will be lost if suddenly stripped of all he is accustomed to A dog also teaches us a thing or two about, unselfish love: When a dog knows death is approaching, it tries, with its last vestige of strength, to crawl away elsewhere to die, in order toburden its owners no more A dog does things with all vigor, However, when there is nothing to do, it lies down and rests, it does not waste its strength and energy needlessly. Many working people are burning the candles at both ends. Many suffer nervous breakdowns due to stress. Perhaps, they should learn to rest like a dog does.SUMMARY​</h2><br />

                            21. The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</h2><br />
