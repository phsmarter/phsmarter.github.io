Often, people thought that these technologies belong to the realm of science fiction movies and novels. But what turned these technologies into a reality is the insatiable thirst for knowledge that we, humans, specifically scientists, have. It is this thirst for knowledge that drove scientists and researchers to develop a specific discipline for different scientific queries. Sometimes, these disciplines overlap and give room for a collaborative discipline. Let's consider the fields of spectroscopy and photography, The principles in these two different fields were used to create spectral imaging The same thirst for knowledge also led scientists and researchers to exert extraordinary efforts just to understand a phenomenon, a species, or a scientific event, Lake forume howa group ofresearcherstock measures to study superbolt Sometimes thisthistorie guides us in understanding possible threats to our day to day use Understanding what superbelts are can help us determine when and we they occur and prevent them from causing irreparable damage tous Our thirst for knowledge is indeed what brought us to where we right now and where we will be the future B.

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes.

The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. 
THE writer presented what point of view?

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

                                            Instructions: Read the essay, Children Should Not Use Smartphones Excessively, and find other information about it. Formulate your synthesis and apply your knowledge on organizing sources. Be guided by the rubric. With the rise of smartphone technology, many parents are letting their children use their smartphones. While it may seem to be harmless, the benefits of letting children use smartphones can be argued. Smartphones can have an impact on a child's development. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact they have on a child's development. Before smartphones, what did children do for fun? Kids used to spend their free time playing outdoors with their friends. This is where children learned to interact with others. They made friends, and used their imagination to have fun. Children didn't require devices to stay entertained, they had to have fun with others. With the availability of smartphones, children are becoming familiar with them at a very early age. This leads parents to feel like they can cause their children to have social problems by using the devices too much or to be harassed for not using smart devices. This leaves some parents in between a rock and a hard place. (Craig) Smartphones prohibit children from socially interacting. Children who use their parent's smartphones for playing games miss out on opportunities to interact with others. Children can become addicted to the games, this can cause problems later in life when they need social skills.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well... Im not sure</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Loss of Infrastructure</p><p></p><p>Infrastructure all around the world will be affected heavily. Equipment in hospitals, equipment for air traffic control, banking systems, navigation systems, computer and more gadgets will not be available for usage. The technology that we dear so much, and assists us in so many ways will not be available to us. Moreover, with most things now going online, data records stored in computer or banking system will not be available anymore. We will have to resort to pen and paper in order to create records and do several other things.</p><p></p><p>Whether it be banks, government offices, research centers, or hospitals, their productivity will reduce greatly. Especially in the medical sector, where advancement of technology has greatly and deeply assisted the surgeries, and treatment of the patients. There are various treatments or operations, which cannot be performed without the right equipment and machines. Several diseases will become incurable due to the loss of technology.</p><p></p><p>No Communication</p><p></p><p>These will no longer be any method for communication. Without mobile phones, computer or the internet, most of the communication will be gone. People far away from each other will no longer be able to interact with each other. With a major part of communication gone, there will no longer be exchanges between countries, which will result in a great loss of productivity. Man-made and natural resources, native to one place, will also become hard to transport. Moreover, as internet will be lost, business platform for several people will collapse. Several people today interact and do their business online, and have set up their websites on the internet, however, without internet; these people will be forced to some other resort. Advertising, merchant, brokerage, manufacturer, community, utility, subscription, internet marketing and affiliate community models, everything will go into rapid decline.</p><p></p><p>No Functionality</p><p></p><p>With no form of transport, communication, networks, satellites, machinery, all the work will be resorted back to humans. A task or action, which can be done through one computer or machine, may take several people to do it. Things will not be able to mass-produce anymore. Whether it be eatables or anything else, without the right machines, items will only be made in limited amount. Functionality, flexibility and accuracy will be greatly lost with the loss of technology.</p><p></p><p>In a society where humans are highly dependent on technology, it can be safely said that without technology, the loss of resources will be great. As we have adapted into a modern society, where everything can be controlled with a button or flick of a finger, it is impossible to think of a world being ran without technology.</p><p></p><p>As professional writing services, www.writing-expert.com has written several articles on similar themes.</p><br />

Works can be done easier through high-tech machines and equipment. It gives less work for humans and job can be done faster. It makes human to feel comfortable and easy to live.</p><p></p><p>From personalized computers in our pockets to self-driving cars, the world is at our fingertips today thanks to technology. Technology has advanced into many areas of our lives, making information more accessible, improving communication, changing transportation, and the list goes on.  While it is easy to sit back and benefit from a plethora of technological advancements, it is crucial we do not become blind to its effects on society. Today, society is hugely reliant on technology and showing no signs of curtailing its dependence.

Then also try to imagine how life was like 10 decades ago. differences would surely be astonishing. Not long ago, many of the technologies that we are enjoying now sounded too good to be true. Often, people thought that these technologies belong to the realm of science fiction movies and novels. But what turned these technologies into a reality is the insatiable thirst for knowledge that we, humans, specifically scientists, have. It is this thirst for knowledge that drove scientists and researchers to develop a specific discipline for different scientific queries. Sometimes, these disciplines overlap and give room for a collaborative discipline. Let's consider the fields of spectroscopy and photography, The principles in these two different fields were used to create spectral imaging The same thirst for knowledge also led scientists and researchers to exert extraordinary efforts just to understand a phenomenon, a species, or a scientific event, Lake forume howa group ofresearcherstock measures to study superbolt Sometimes thisthistorie guides us in understanding possible threats to our day to day use Understanding what superbelts are can help us determine when and we they occur and prevent them from causing irreparable damage tous Our thirst for knowledge is indeed what brought us to where we right now and where we will be the future B.

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Formulate your synthesis and apply your knowledge on organizing sources. Be guided by the rubric. With the rise of smartphone technology, many parents are letting their children use their smartphones. While it may seem to be harmless, the benefits of letting children use smartphones can be argued. Smartphones can have an impact on a child's development. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact they have on a child's development. Before smartphones, what did children do for fun? Kids used to spend their free time playing outdoors with their friends. This is where children learned to interact with others. They made friends, and used their imagination to have fun. Children didn't require devices to stay entertained, they had to have fun with others. With the availability of smartphones, children are becoming familiar with them at a very early age. This leads parents to feel like they can cause their children to have social problems by using the devices too much or to be harassed for not using smart devices. This leaves some parents in between a rock and a hard place. (Craig) Smartphones prohibit children from socially interacting. Children who use their parent's smartphones for playing games miss out on opportunities to interact with others. Children can become addicted to the games, this can cause problems later in life when they need social skills. According to an article by Nina Pilapil, games that are designed for kids can keep them from social interaction Parents should limit their children's time spent on a smartphone and encourage them to play with friends instead. While exposure to smartphones is not necessarily a bad thing in small doses, it should be limited and monitored. (Pilapil) Children are becoming more obese. This is caused in part by a lack of physical activity. Smartphones are too great. Children will have less social interaction and more health and development problems when they use smartphones in excess. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact smartphones on a child's development. At first, I'm thinking that using phones​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A Time When Technology Made My Life More Difficult</p><p>The way we live today is significantly different from the way our forefathers lived fiftyor sixty years ago. Thanks to all the technology we have these days, we got just about everyamenities we need to live a comfortable life. What is technology? According to OxfordDictionary (2018), technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes,especially in industry. By using technology, we can accomplish various tasks in our daily lives.Technology can also be described as products and processes used to simplify our daily lives.Indeed, we use technology to extend our abilities and make people the most crucial part ofany technological system. However, it is vital to know if technology is well applied, it benefitshumans, but if we misused technology, it will be a double edged sword to humans.Without further ado, I would like to share about a time when technology made my lifemore difficult. I cannot deny that technology had always help me to solve many problems butsometimes it just complicates me. As a student, mobile phone is a technology that I oftenused. I bring mobile phone wherever I went to appropriate certain places such as in the class.Indeed, mobile phone benefits in education system. I usually use my mobile phone to organisemy schedule, share notes and connect with my family and friends. By using mobile phone tofind information is also much faster than using laptop and computer. However, it was a tougherlife for me as mobile phone had become my best friend before this. In fact, mobile phone wasa friend but it also a wolf who in sheep clothing.Based on my experience, mobile phone has made my life more complicated. However,can anybody now imagine of a world which does not have any access to mobile phone or anymodern technologies? The truth is we cannot. I agree that it is not easy to live without mobilephone as I used to enjoy it. As a student, mobile phone always affect to my studies and dailyplans. There are reasons for me to say those things. These days, mobile phone is alwaysavailable under my fingertips with the click of a button or a few taps on a glass screen. Withoutany second thought, I will start playing my favourite game within seconds or send a short textin the blink of an eye. Eventually, I stop doing homework or revision and start playing gamesand scrolling social media using the hush phone. Almost every day I will go to bed at one or two in the early morning. Why do I sleeplate? It was all about mobile phone. I realised that I should get some rest to recharge myenergy by having enough sleep. However, I did not know why every single day</p><br />
