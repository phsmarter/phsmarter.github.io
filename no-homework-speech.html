                        <p><strong>Answer in explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>while to some it seems logical to ban homework-- I'm afraid that's not as true as it seems, homework is in many ways beneficial; it helps students take what they learn outside of school in a place where they might look at the information differently and have more time to learn from it. For example, a student may feel distracted at school but have a more quiet place to learn at home, and practicing the things they learn can stick with them through life. </p><p></p><p>That's an example, in a persuasive speech its important to keep the attention of whoever is reading while still covering the main points, having a strong argument is most important when you try to persuade someone.</p><br />

These words ascribe an attribute to the noun being modified.</p><p></p><p>The sleepy bear hibernated all winter.</p><p>It's a long drive, but it's worth the trip.</p><p>Should I buy the blue jeans or purple sweater?</p><p>Adverbs</p><p></p><p>Adverbs modify or describe a verb, adjective, or another adverb or word group. This modification provides information relating to time, place, manner, cause, degree, or circumstance.</p><p></p><p>Joe grumpily got out of bed.</p><p>Sara ran very quickly to school.</p><p>That's quite expensive, don't you think?</p><p>Conjunctions</p><p></p><p>Conjunctions are used to connect words, phrases, and clauses. They coordinate the words together so they make sense as a cohesive thought, sentence, or paragraph.</p><p></p><p>You'll need to study all night if you want to pass tomorrow's test.</p><p>Go to the store and buy some milk.</p><p>Kristopher doesn't have enough experience. Therefore, we will not hire him.</p><p>Interjections</p><p></p><p>Interjections are words used as exclamations to show feelings.

                        <p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Good day everyone,</p><p></p><p>As a student, I know that we all have different opinions when it comes to the "No Homework Policy" that some schools have adopted. While some students may welcome this policy with open arms, I personally disagree with it. Today, I would like to share with you my reasons for disagreeing with this policy.</p><p></p><p>Arguments:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework is an essential part of the learning process. It helps students to reinforce what they have learned in class and to develop their skills and knowledge further. Without homework, students may struggle to retain information and may not have enough practice to master new concepts. In the long run, this could affect their academic performance and hinder their progress.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework teaches students important life skills such as time management, responsibility, and discipline. These skills are crucial for success in both academic and professional settings. By completing homework assignments, students learn to manage their time effectively, prioritize tasks, and meet deadlines. These skills are invaluable in the real world and can help students to achieve their goals.</p><p></p><p>Finally, homework provides an opportunity for parents to be involved in their child's education. Parents can help their children with homework, providing them with support and guidance. This can strengthen the parent-child relationship and create a more positive learning environment.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while the "No Homework Policy" may seem appealing at first glance, I believe that it is not in the best interest of students. Homework is an essential part of the learning process, teaching students important skills and reinforcing their knowledge. I urge schools to reconsider this policy and to continue to assign homework to their students. Thank you for listening.</p><p></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><p>Good day everyone! Today, I would like to express my opinion on the "No Homework Policy" that has been circulating among schools. While many are in favor of this policy, I strongly disagree with it.</p><p><strong>Arguments:</strong></p><p>Firstly, homework is an essential part of the learning process. It reinforces the lessons taught in class, allows students to practice what they've learned, and helps them prepare for exams. Without homework, students may not fully comprehend the topics discussed in class and may struggle to apply what they've learned in real-life situations.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework teaches important life skills such as time management, responsibility, and discipline. By completing assignments on time, students learn how to manage their time effectively, prioritize tasks, and meet deadlines. These skills are valuable in their academic and future professional lives.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, homework provides an opportunity for parents to be involved in their child's education. They can help their children with their assignments, monitor their progress, and communicate with teachers if necessary. This strengthens the parent-child-teacher relationship and promotes a supportive learning environment.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>In conclusion, while the "No Homework Policy" may seem attractive to some, it does not promote effective learning and can hinder a student's progress. Homework plays a vital role in the learning process, helps students develop important life skills, and promotes a positive parent-child-teacher relationship. Thank you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A Stanford researcher found that students in high-achieving communities who spend too much time on homework experience more stress, physical health problems, a lack of balance and even alienation from society. More than two hours of homework a night may be counterproductive, according to the study. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>4.Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p><p></p><p>5.One of the valuable reasons why homework should be banned is the fact most teachers fail to explain everything needed to solve the task during the class. Parents cannot help with every task. Student's friends lack the experience to help, and they have work to do.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me, if im wrong. </p><p>hope it helps!</p><br />

                        Giving homeworks is a way for us students to learn more. So, when examinations come you can go over these homeworks. Homeworks is also a way for us to not get used on being lazy. This is a test for students so that they will learn how to be independent and experience the stress. We will encounter stress in our daily lives and what we have to do is just accept it. Fear, stress, anxiety... embrace it. It will help you get stronger. It demands to be felt. Having homeworks can be tiresome I agree, however it helps me to be productive.<br />
