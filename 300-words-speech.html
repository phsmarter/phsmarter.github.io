                        <p><strong>" Preservation in our Environment "</strong></p><p><strong>It is critical that our environment remain clean and life-sustaining. This, unfortunately, is not the case. Our actions are harming the environment in which we live. There is an urgent need to take proactive environmental protection measures and involve the younger generation in them.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>There are many ways to improve the condition of the environment, as part of the younger generation, I believe we should practice these ways to help preserve the healthiness of our environment.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Recycle and Reuse</strong></p><p><strong>A large portion of waste that pollutes the environment is made up of dumped household materials that are no longer in use, such as plastic and glass bottles, tin cans, broken computers or other plastic items, clothes, and so on. These waste materials enter the soil and water, where they can pollute and degrade the quality for years. We could do a great deal to save the environment if we just took the simple step of recycling waste instead of throwing it away.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Save Trees</strong></p><p><strong>Trees are the planet's lungs, making them vital members of the environment. They also serve as filters, keeping a location's air quality index high. They consume carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, which is required for life. There is no need to mention the millions of life forms that trees support - birds, insects, reptiles, and so on. The more threes we save, the greater our contribution to environmental health.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Don’t Litter</strong></p><p><strong>How many of you have seen plastic bags, bottles, food packages, and other items littered around beaches, monuments, and market places? Litter is the most harmful to the environment because it rots and pollutes it. The best thing we can do to help the environment is to avoid littering. Make it a habit to properly dispose of waste in a trash can. If you don't see one nearby, keep looking until you do.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Educate and Inspire</strong></p><p><strong>We must educate and raise awareness about the environment and how it can be preserved. Special emphasis should be placed on teaching the young and the children. When young children are taught about the importance of the environment, they will recognize its importance as they grow older. We should also serve as role models for others by planting trees and organizing cleanliness campaigns.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The protection of the environment is in the hands of humans. Only humans can take initiative and save the environment, thereby saving lives on the planet.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>btw ang kyooot ni wonyoung sa pfp mo</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Good Morning to one and all present here. I am going to present a short speech on Environment. Our environment consists of all living beings as well as their surroundings. A healthy environment is one that is sustainable for a long period of time. It is the source of life for everyone. It directs the life of everyone and determines proper growth and development.The good or bad quality of our life is depending on the quality of our natural environment. Our need for food, water, shelter, and other things depends on the environment around us. There must be a balanced natural cycle that exists between the environment and the lives of human beings, plants, and animals.<p></p>Human society is playing a vital role in degenerating the natural environment which is affecting badly the lives on this planet. All the human actions in this modern world directly impact our ecosystem.  Many actions of us have brought big changes to this planet, resulting in many environmental problems. Increasing demand for technologies and industries is another important factor.Various Environmental IssuesThere are many harmful effects of human activities on the environment. Some of these are pollution, overpopulation, waste disposal, climate change, global warming, the greenhouse effect, etc. The big reason that poses a serious threat to our environment is the harmful gases in the air.The uncontrolled use of automobiles has increased their effects, which in turn emit harmful gases like Carbon monoxide. Electronic appliances like air conditioners and refrigerators also contaminate the air by the discharge of harmful substances. The diverse effect of these gases is causing air pollution as well as global warming.<br /><br />Deforestation is another major reason. The human population is increasing at a fast rate and therefore to meet their daily consumption we need to cut forests and trees. It may be for home or for fuel, but we are causing a great loss to the environment.<p><strong>Explanation:<br /></strong></p><p><strong>You're Welcome!!❤❤<br />Pls Brainly </strong></p><br />

                            5. Speech in 300 words how to keep hope alive in times of challenges ​</h2><br />
                        <p>Hope is the main mechanism and weapon we bring with us in times of challenges.  For as long as there is hope, even a tiny piece of it, we believe that we can make it through.  We can keep on moving forward as we are empowered on that tiny lit of hope for it brings enough spark that we think we need.  
</p><p>
</p><p>However, when we seem to carry too much burdens and face obstacles that are beyond our capacity, we surely tend to breakdown and lose our very hope.  We soften up and may give up by then.  Our hope does not have to come to its end.  It should not turn into a ball of dismay and failure.  Our hope should keep on firing up as we feel the urge to give up.
</p><p>
</p><p>Speak up and touch a soul.  We all need someone to hold our hopes for us when we feel like overly burdened by our trials and sufferings.  Voice out your need for help because who does not?  Some people are born to be a genuine aid for someone like us.  Someone will surely listen.  Someone will surely support us.  Let that person be your hope.  It is more empowering to know that someone knows and listens, and bothers to keep us afire.
</p><p>
</p><p>Our failure is not the endgame.  Let us always keep our heads up even if the odds are all against us.  May our remaining belief in ourselves that we can serve as our best shot of hope.  May we learn to tap our shoulders and say, “Go ahead.  Start again if you must.”  May we be our very own hope that will keep us going forward.  May we invest that hope on how we always manage to take those tiny brave steps from the moment when hope first bloomed in us.

                            6. 300 word speech about "poverty is not due to overpopulation but because of inequality and corruption"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>It is a common misconception that poverty is solely caused by overpopulation. However, the reality is far from it. Poverty is primarily a result of inequality and corruption, and not due to the number of people living in a certain area.</p><p></p><p>Inequality is a fundamental issue that results in a small group of people having the majority of resources and wealth, while the vast majority of people have little to no access to basic necessities like food, clean water, and healthcare. This inequality is perpetuated by systemic issues such as unequal distribution of resources, biased economic policies, and inadequate social safety nets. The wealthy have access to quality education and job opportunities while the poor are denied access to these essential tools. As a result, the cycle of poverty continues.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, corruption also plays a significant role in poverty. When people in power use their position to gain wealth and power for themselves, they are actively taking resources away from those in need. Corruption also leads to a lack of transparency and accountability, which means that resources meant to help the poor are often misused or stolen, leaving those in need without any aid.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that overpopulation is not the main cause of poverty. While population growth can lead to increased strain on resources, it is not the root cause of poverty. Countries with high population densities such as Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong have managed to develop successful economies and provide their citizens with a high standard of living.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to overpopulation. It is caused by inequality and corruption, which perpetuate a vicious cycle of poverty. To eradicate poverty, we need to address these systemic issues and promote equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. We must also fight corruption and ensure that resources meant for the poor are not misused or stolen. It is time for us to come together and work towards a future where poverty is no longer a reality. Thank you.</p><br />

Strong Family Ties - Filipinos place a great emphasis on family and the bonds that tie them together.<br />3.

Creativity - Filipinos are known for their creativity and ingenuity, especially in the arts and entertainment industry.<br />5. Faith and Spirituality - Religion plays a significant role in the lives of many Filipinos, with a majority of the population being Roman Catholic.<br /><br />Negative Traits:<br />1. Crab Mentality - Filipinos are sometimes known for their tendency to pull others down, especially those who succeed or achieve more than them.<br />2. Lack of Discipline - The Philippine culture is sometimes criticized for being lax in rules and discipline.<br />3. Colonial Mentality - Filipinos, due to their history of colonization, may sometimes have a mindset that favors foreign things over their own.<br />4. Procrastination - Filipinos may have a habit of putting things off until the last minute.<br />5. "Bahala Na" Attitude - Filipinos sometimes have a tendency to leave things to chance or fate instead of taking action and being proactive.<br /><br />These traits, both positive and negative, are not unique to Filipinos and are present in other cultures as well. It is important to recognize these traits and work on improving ourselves while celebrating the positive aspects of our culture.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipinos are known for their unique personality and characteristics that make them stand out from the rest of the world. As with any culture, Filipinos have both positive and negative traits that have been shaped by their history, traditions, and environment. In this speech, I will discuss some of the positive and negative personality traits of Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the positive traits. Filipinos are known for their hospitality, warmth, and friendliness. They have a strong sense of family and community, and are always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. This trait is deeply ingrained in Filipino culture, and is evident in the way they treat guests and strangers alike. Filipinos are also known for their resilience and determination, especially in times of adversity. They have a strong sense of faith and optimism, and believe that things will always work out in the end.</p><p></p><p>However, Filipinos also have some negative traits that they need to work on. One of the most prominent negative traits is “crab mentality”, which refers to the tendency of some Filipinos to pull down others who are succeeding or doing well in life. This trait is often driven by jealousy or insecurity, and can be detrimental to both the individual and the community. Another negative trait is “mañana habit”, which refers to the tendency to procrastinate or put off tasks until the last minute. This trait can lead to missed opportunities and a lack of productivity.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Filipinos can be too passive or non-confrontational when it comes to addressing issues or problems. They may avoid conflicts or difficult conversations, which can lead to misunderstandings or unaddressed concerns. This trait can also be detrimental to personal growth and development.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Filipinos have both positive and negative personality traits that shape their behavior and interactions with others. While their hospitality, resilience, and determination are admirable traits, they must also work on addressing negative traits such as crab mentality, mañana habit, and non-confrontation. By recognizing and addressing these negative traits, Filipinos can continue to build on their positive traits and make progress towards personal and societal growth.</p><br />

A child always needs the warmth and love of their parents. As we grow older, we learn to become more independent and do not need our parents as much. However, they are always there when we need them, and they will ever love us. As they grow older, they need our help and attention. Moving on with our lives and forgetting about them affects them, and they feel lonely. We need to be there for them the same way they were with us.</strong></p><br />

                        <strong>HERE </strong><strong>ARE</strong><strong> THE</strong><strong> ANSWER</strong><strong>:</strong><p></p><p><strong>Gender equality is the belief that all people, regardless of their gender, should be treated equally and have the same opportunities. This includes equal access to education, employment, and representation in leadership positions.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Feminism is a social, political, and ideological movement that aims to advance the rights and status of women. It is based on the belief that women and men should be treated equally, and that gender should not determine an individual's opportunities or experiences</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Masculinism, also known as men's rights activism, is a movement that seeks to address issues that affect men and boys, such as the gender pay gap, the disproportionate representation of men in the criminal justice system, and societal expectations of masculinity.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>It is important to recognize that gender equality does not mean that one gender is superior to the other, or that the experiences and needs of one gender should be prioritized over the other. Instead, it means acknowledging and valuing the unique experiences and needs of all genders, and working towards creating a society in which all individuals have the same opportunities and are treated with respect and dignity.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Feminism and masculinism both aim to promote gender equality, but they do so in different ways. Feminism focuses on advancing the rights and status of women, while masculinism focuses on issues that affect men and boys. It is important to recognize that both approaches are necessary in order to achieve true gender equality.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>One of the key challenges in promoting gender equality is combating gender stereotypes and biases. These biases can take many forms, including discrimination in the workplace, unequal pay, and societal expectations about how men and women should behave and what they should be interested in. It is important to challenge these stereotypes and biases, and to create a society in which individuals are free to express themselves and pursue their interests regardless of their gender.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In conclusion, gender equality is the belief that all people, regardless of their gender, should be treated equally and have the same opportunities. It is important to recognize the unique experiences and needs of all genders, and to work towards creating a society in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Both feminism and masculinism play important roles in promoting gender equality, and it is important to address issues that affect both men and women in order to achieve true equality.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><strong>3</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>0</strong><strong> </strong><strong>WORDS </strong><strong>YAN </strong><strong>BAKA </strong><strong>PWEDE </strong><strong>PAKI </strong><strong>BRAINLIEST</strong><strong> </strong><strong>NAMAN </strong><strong>THANKS </strong><strong>.</strong><p></p><br />

I like Christmas could happen soon each</strong></p><p><strong>Difficult to contend with thing about Christmas, because still people who charge that it's one faith's day</strong></p><p><strong>have no trouble getting to Yule parties, consuming Christmas dinners, listening to Christmas music and,</strong></p><p><strong>oh yeah, getting Christmas presents. Apart from this Super Bowl, it's actually the only better thing of</strong></p><p><strong>season, and might get the best position if you didn''t get to deal with the trauma that is December at the</strong></p><p><strong>mall.

Yes, day. Danish Christmas is on this</strong></p><p><strong>Eve of this 24th.

These are only</strong></p><p><strong>entertaining small things that think Christmas is here. There is nothing extraordinary or important about</strong></p><p><strong>them; they only exist after so many years of discovering them.ar. I try to be diplomatic about most topics,</strong></p><p><strong>and I have attempted to remain tactful about the topic, but I can't. The day is also special and magical to</strong></p><p><strong>match with others. I am not offending people with different opinions, as I like grace, Holloween, freedom</strong></p><p><strong>time, New year's, and more, but I only think that Christmas tops over these holidays.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>in the world we are in a fight of our lives against the coronavirus. It has affected many people including myself. I'm now at home every day and it really is affecting me socially. Not being able to speak to friends and see people I see on a regular basis is hard for me. Also, now that school is closed for the rest of the year it has really had an effect on my school life. I am not used to being at home all the time and working on the computer. I'm usually in a classroom surrounded by my peers. However, I am human so I will learn to adapt, but for now it is hard.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>It has affected me personally in the social and educational aspect, but I know around the city of Detroit it's affecting others as well. In Detroit, which is one of the cities around the country hit hard by the virus, the pandemic has also affected the youth. Youth are now forced to stay home instead of going to school and spending time with friends. Most kids need to be outside and with people to release their energy and socialize. Now this cannot happen, because the virus has affected us so much. One thing we also see happening is food insecurities and social distancing. Due to what is happening in the world, people are very much afraid and cautious about food supply and interactions with people. People are afraid and are told to stay inside, so we stock up supplies that will last them about a month. Usually people get stuff that we will last them about two weeks, but now we need to stay home as much as we can.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>With social distancing, we now separate ourselves from other parts of society. This has made me feel very much disconnected from my friends. Humans are made to be out and about and socialize with beings on Earth. These unfortunate events have led many people to be disconnected from society. This has allowed my mind to go to the dark side, where my fears come out. My main fear is “How long will my life be on pause?” I’m afraid of how long I will be stuck in the house and can’t see my friends. Will it be a couple more weeks or will it be a couple months?</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club has helped me a lot during this crisis. Just for a couple hours, I’m able to forget about the real world and have a good time. This is because the club has come to us. The Virtual Club has helped me still talk to people and meet new people as well. BGCSM has helped me through a lot of things in my life these past few years. So, I know for sure it helps other kids through these tough times. This experience with BGCSM virtually is helping lighten my heart, through my darkest time</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Modular learning is a form of distance learning that uses Self-Learning Modules (SLM) based on the most essential learning competencies (MELCS) provided by DepEd. The modules include sections on motivation and assessment that serve as a complete guide of both teachers' and students' desired competencies.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Almost all theories of human development agree upon the fact that society is the key factor in the development of a human being. This is what teaches people to learn how the world is organized and structured by means of communication and provides them with the possibility to evaluate themselves through the perception of other individuals. However, I strongly disagree that society is the key factor in shaping a personality.<p></p>First, it starts influencing a person only after a certain age, usually when an individual is not younger than three, which means that the basis of the personality has already been shaped by the family. It means that the community will undoubtedly influence the character, values, and ideas of a person, but only up to a point where it will face the barrier of the values acquired in a family.<p></p>Further on, I firmly believe that any person has a definite set of inborn features and inclinations. If you try to observe even a very little baby, you will see that even at the youngest possible age, they possess their unique personality, being calm or active, stubborn or obedient, cautious or reckless. These features can be modified and changed slightly, but it is absolutely impossible to eliminate them completely.<p></p>So, despite the huge influence of society on the formation of a human being as a personality, the leading role still belongs to the family and nature. The person is born with a personality, and what we can do as teachers and parents is only adapt it slightly.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>@CarryonLearning<br />

                            27. 300 word speech about what filipinos should realize​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Over 100 years have passed since these words were written, and yet the challenge to us, the Filipino youth, is as relevant as ever. As young adults on the quest of discovering who we are and who we are meant to be, the role of nation building has been firmly placed in our hands. Mentors from generations before have done their part in shaping the nation and are grooming us, the Filipino youth, to be the next change agents.
</p><p>
</p><p>In our short stay here, we have witnessed the tragic effects of our nation’s most lamentable social ills: the orchestrated misuse of government funds, the systemic violation of basic human rights, and the continuous loss of life and property due to abandonment and greed.
</p><p>
</p><p>Through all of these, it has become more and more apparent that our nation needs more Filipinos than citizens.It is easy to imbibe “Filipino Pride” in our moments of triumph – with every win of Manny Pacquiao, every article on the Philippines as the projected thriving economy of the next decade, and every tourist video espousing the natural beauty of our motherland.
</p><p>
</p><p>But being Filipino is much more than a celebration of our collective successes; it is also an inheritance of the not-so-beautiful aspects of this country: its culture of impunity, widespread poverty, and institutional corruption, among others.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What is Terrorism?</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Terorism is the major problem that is facing Pakistan which is root cause all problems. It has become</p><p></p><p>more destructive than previous years. Due to this, foreign investment is stopped in the country. Anarchy is</p><p></p><p>everywhere, nobody in certain about the situation that what is exactly going on in Pakistan? Ace we</p><p></p><p>fighting against terrorism or we om just seeing the events? Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quette and all</p><p></p><p>parts of the country are at top hit ist of terroasts and they are doing well with ther barbarianism. Today or</p><p></p><p>tomonow Pakistan will have to eliminate terrorism from country Otherwise it would become another</p><p></p><p>Somalia</p><p></p><p>on the</p><p></p><p>of</p><p></p><p>world</p><p></p><p>In last UN Convention in which all heads of States were present, PM india Man Mohan Singh said Pakistan is the Epicenter of Terrorism and all people that were sit in that convention endorsed his statement without considering that Pakistan gave lot of lives in this fight of terrorism, army men and also public. Today, bomb blast or suicide bombing is normal thing for the citizens of Pakistan. Many Pakistanis ore dying these blasts but they are facing it by bravery. But the whole world is continuously pointing to us as terrorist state. What a shame? There is no govt. official that can say truth to the world and to the citizens of Pakistan that are still seeing towards leadership</p><p></p><p>This is happening with us because of our slavery and corrupt leadership that made such decisions and policies through we are reached at the edge of another partition. Our Establishment launched Jihad to rescue the people of Afghanistan against USSR. We defeated USSR badly with the help of USA and got huge success. Now the scenario has been totally changed for last 10 years. USA replaced USSR and it is fighting against these Afghanis that were fighting with USA against USSR. Pakistan played the same role and it is helping USA against those Afghanis. Presently Pakistan is considered as infide! (Kafir) state by this Pakistani Taliban.</p><p></p><p>So, Pakistan is facing different war scenes. TTP which has origin of Pakistan is fighting against Pakistani State and Afghani Taliban is fighting against USA in Afghanistan. This wart is continuously going and USA is ready to leave this region by the beginning of 2014 but what about Pakistan? Pakistan has to do something to get rid of this problem because after going USA Pakistan will become the prime target for both of them which will be very deadly detrimental for Pakistan and it should plan something long term. to make itself safe from these coming situations.</p><br />
