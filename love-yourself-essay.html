</p><p>
</p><p>The way that God, our Creator, intends for us to live is known by every human being. How God intends for us to live is called God's will or God's law; Jesus referred to God's law as His commandment or word. Jesus taught that it is God's will for us to love our neighbor.
</p><p>
</p><p>When asked which is the greatest of God's commandments, Jesus replied, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself," (Matthew 22:37-39).
</p><p>
</p><p>We show our love for other people with respect and appreciation for their value or worth as human beings. According to Jesus, we can show our respect for others by doing unto others as you would have them do unto you</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Celebrate your successes and acknowledge your progress, no matter how small.</p><p></p><p>Challenge negative self-talk: Pay attention to the negative thoughts that run through your mind and challenge them. Ask yourself if they're based in reality, and if they're not, replace them with more positive and realistic thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Take care of your physical health: Exercise regularly, eat nutritious foods, get enough sleep, and take care of your physical health. When you feel good physically, it can help boost your mood and self-esteem.</p><p></p><p>Surround yourself with positive influences: Surround yourself with people who love and support you and who inspire you to be your best self.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A mix of emotions, behaviors, and beliefs associated with strong feelings of affection, protectiveness, warmth, and respect for another person. Love can also be used to apply to non-human animals, to principles, and to religious beliefs</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If you can learn to love yourself and all the flaws, you can love other people so much better. And that makes you so happy.</p><p></p><p>Why is it so difficult to love ourselves? Basically, the short answer to this question is that we were raised in a society that didn’t teach us about self-love. This may not seem very important to some, but self-love is one of the best things you can do for yourself.</p><p></p><p>Loving yourself provides you with self-confidence, self-worth, and in general, you feel more positive. If you can learn to love yourself, you will feel happier and will learn to take better care of yourself.</p><p></p><p>Looking in the mirror, most of us see a lot of different flaws and remember too many past experiences and failings to love ourselves. The less you love yourself, listen to yourself, and understand yourself, the more confused, upset, and frustrated you will be in life. When you begin to love yourself and continue to love yourself more and more each day, things slowly will be a little bit better in every way possible.</p><br />

Lisa Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Medicine, shares these guidelines: <br /><br />Avoid close contact with others.<br /><br />It’s important to understand that the new coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person. If an infected person coughs or sneezes, their droplets can infect people nearby. That’s why it’s important to avoid close contact with others. Understand that people (including children) may be infected with the new coronavirus and have only mild symptoms.<br /><br />Some measures you can take to avoid close contact with others include:<br /><br />•Stay home as much as possible and reduce visitors.<br />•Practice physical distancing:<br />•Stay at least six feet away from others in public places.<br />•Call friends and family or visit by video.<br />•Ask your employer if it’s possible to work from home.<br />•Avoid people who appear sick.<br />•Go grocery shopping and run errands during off-peak times.<br />•Wear a face mask whenever you are in a public place where you will encounter other people. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can spread between people interacting in close proximity — for example, speaking, coughing, sneezing, or singing— even if those people do not symptoms. Learn more information about how masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19.<br /><br />Practice good hygiene wherever you are.<br /><br />The new coronavirus can survive for hours or even days on some surfaces. Touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face is one of the ways to become infected.<br /><br />The virus is no longer detectable on plastic after 72 hours, and on stainless steel or cardboard after about 48 hours. With that in mind:<br /><br />•Wash your hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, especially:<br />•After being in public places and touching door handles, shopping carts, elevator buttons, etc.<br />•After using the bathroom<br />•Before preparing food<br />•If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.<br />•Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially with unwashed hands.<br />•If you cough or sneeze, do so in the bend of your elbow. If you use a tissue, throw it away immediately.<br /><br />Take precautions if you are living with or caring for someone who is sick.<br /><br />•Wear a mask if you are caring for someone who has respiratory symptoms.<br />•Clean counters, door knobs, phones and tablets frequently, using disinfectant cleaners or wipes.<br /><br />If you feel sick, follow these guidelines:<br /><br />•Stay home if you feel sick unless you are experiencing a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath or a very high fever.<br />•Call your doctor or urgent care facility and explain your symptoms over the phone.<br />•If you leave your home to get medical care, wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms.<br /><br />StepByStepExplaination <br />#CarryOnLearning<br />#BrainLyPH<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.

What will you do when calamities such as typhoons, earthquakes, and meteor impacts will occur? Give at least 5
ways on how will you protect yourself and your love ones from these natural disasters.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>No one expects to be caught in a potentially dangerous and extreme situation such as a natural disaster. If the unthinkable does occur, having a plan and knowing what to do could make all the difference for you and your loved ones. These four tips can help you stay safe during a disaster.</p><p></p><p>1. If you have not been ordered to evacuate, stay in a safe area or shelter during a natural disaster. In your home, a safe area may be a ground floor interior room, closet or bathroom. Be sure you have access to your survival kit in case you are in an emergency event that lasts several days.</p><p></p><p>2. Listen to your portable radio for important updates and instructions from local authorities. Remember to have a battery-powered radio in your survival kit. Some radios are now equipped with multiple power sources, such as batteries, solar panels and a hand crank.</p><p></p><p>3. If power is lost, use a generator with caution. Make sure conditions are safe before operating a portable generator. Only operate it outside — away from windows, doors or vents. Follow all manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p></p><p>4. Stay in your safe area and do not drive until the danger has passed. Resist the temptation to check on your property until you are sure it is safe to do so.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRILLANTES PO</p><p></p><br />
