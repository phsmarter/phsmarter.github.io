                        <p>The process of recruiting employees into a company is vital as these human resources areviewed to be a strategic investment. The success of companies largely depends on itshuman resource. Of late, higher learning institutions are churning out an unending supply offresh graduates that add to the competition in the job market. Yet, the question ariseswhether the employer should hire these younger workers or to select from the more seniorgroup.I believe that younger workers should be hired.(THESIS STATEMENT_)Firstly, employers should hire young workers because they are fresh and energetic.(ARGUMENT 1) Apart from the advantage of age, young employees are flexible, ready tolearn and are generally more enthusiastic about their work in the hope of gaining experiencewhile vying for promotion. Given the opportunity to put their ideas into practice, they wouldcontribute towards the productivity of the company.

                        <p></p><p>Employment does not only allow us to pay our bills, but is the fundamental outlet in which we express ourselves to the broader community. It defines our daily schedules and also shapes our futures. Anyone who has ever been laid off or spent years without work knows how bad it feels losing work or having nothing to do. There is a lot that goes on in workplaces that can have serious effects on the lives of workers and hence making it necessary to have employment law in place.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One debatable topic about employment is whether or not the government should provide a guaranteed basic income for all citizens. Proponents of this idea argue that a basic income would provide a safety net for those who are unable to find work or who are unable to earn enough to support themselves and their families. It would also provide a financial cushion for those who are facing unforeseen expenses or who are struggling to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Opponents of a guaranteed basic income argue that it would be too expensive and would create a disincentive for people to work. They argue that providing a basic income would reduce the incentive for people to seek employment, and it could lead to higher levels of unemployment and economic stagnation.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the idea of a guaranteed basic income is a complex and controversial topic, with valid arguments on both sides. While some believe that it would provide important support for those in need, others argue that it would be too costly and would undermine the principles of work and personal responsibility.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            6. Why do you need to learn how to write employment instruments? Essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Writing employment instruments is essential to ensure that the terms and conditions of an employee's work are clearly defined and understood. Employment instruments provide the foundation for the relationship between employer and employee. These instruments may include job descriptions, job postings, offer letters, employment contracts, confidentiality agreements, and non-disclosure agreements. It is important to have a clear and comprehensive understanding of these documents in order to create an equitable and mutually beneficial agreement for both parties.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ALWAYS HELP! </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Learning how to write employment instruments, such as resumes, cover letters, and job applications, is essential because these documents are often the first impression that a potential employer has of a job candidate. They are critical tools in the job search process and can greatly impact a candidate's chances of being hired.</p><p></p><p>Effective employment instruments showcase a candidate's skills, experience, and qualifications, and highlight how these attributes align with the requirements of the job. They also demonstrate the candidate's professionalism, attention to detail, and communication skills.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, employers often use these documents to evaluate a candidate's writing and language proficiency, which is an important factor in many job roles. Employers want to hire candidates who can communicate effectively and efficiently, both verbally and in writing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, learning how to write effective employment instruments is an important skill for anyone seeking employment, as it can significantly increase their chances of securing a job that aligns with their career goals and aspirations.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>If my store were in a slum area, the selling strategy I would employ would depend on a few factors such as the type of products I sell, the target customers, and the competition in the area. However, here are a few general strategies that could be effective:</p><p></p><strong>Offer affordable prices:</strong> People living in slum areas often have limited financial resources, so offering products at affordable prices could attract more customers.<p></p><strong>Sell daily necessities:</strong> It would be wise to sell products that cater to daily needs such as food, water, toiletries, and household essentials. These products are in constant demand and could drive frequent visits to the store.<p></p><strong>Create a welcoming atmosphere:</strong> Creating a friendly and welcoming atmosphere in the store could help build a good relationship with the customers. Greeting them with a smile, having conversations, and being helpful could create loyal customers who are likely to return.<p></p><strong>Provide credit facilities:</strong> Since people living in slum areas may have a limited budget, offering credit facilities could be an effective way to increase sales. This could include allowing customers to pay in installments or providing credit for essential products during difficult times.<p></p><strong>Partner with local community leaders:</strong> Partnering with community leaders such as local religious leaders, community elders, or social workers could help build trust with the community and attract more customers.<p></p><strong>Offer delivery services:</strong> Offering home delivery services could be an effective way to attract customers who may have difficulty leaving their homes for various reasons.<p></p><p>Overall, the key to a successful selling strategy in a slum area is to understand the community's needs and challenges and provide products and services that address those needs.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Employment Instruments' Lessons</p><p></p><p>Employment instruments are essential tools that organizations use to manage their human resources. These instruments come in various forms, including contracts, agreements, policies, and procedures. They serve as a guide for employees and employers to understand their roles, responsibilities, and expectations in the workplace. Employment instruments also offer numerous lessons and insights that individuals can learn and apply in various aspects of their lives. In this essay, I will discuss some of the essential things that we can learn from employment instruments.</p><p></p><p>The first lesson that employment instruments can teach us is the importance of clarity and transparency. Clear and transparent communication is crucial in any relationship, including the employer-employee relationship. Employment instruments provide a clear understanding of the terms and conditions of employment, including compensation, benefits, job duties, and expectations. Employees who have a clear understanding of what is expected of them are more likely to perform better and have a more positive work experience. On the other hand, employers who are transparent about their expectations and policies are more likely to build trust and loyalty with their employees.</p><p></p><p>The second lesson that employment instruments can teach us is the importance of fairness and equity. Employment instruments provide a framework for fair treatment of employees. They establish policies and procedures that prevent discrimination, harassment, and other unfair practices in the workplace. By promoting fairness and equity, employment instruments help create a more inclusive workplace where all employees feel valued and respected. These values are critical not only in the workplace but in all aspects of life.</p><p></p><p>The third lesson that employment instruments can teach us is the importance of accountability and responsibility. Employment instruments establish clear lines of accountability and responsibility for both employees and employers. They define the consequences of violating policies and procedures and provide a mechanism for addressing grievances. By promoting accountability and responsibility, employment instruments encourage individuals to take ownership of their actions and promote a culture of personal and professional growth.</p><p></p><p>The fourth lesson that employment instruments can teach us is the importance of adaptability and flexibility. Employment instruments are designed to be dynamic and flexible to meet the changing needs of organizations and their employees. They are revised and updated regularly to reflect changes in laws, regulations, and industry best practices. By promoting adaptability and flexibility, employment instruments help individuals develop skills that are essential in today's rapidly changing work environment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, employment instruments provide valuable lessons that we can apply in various aspects of our lives. They teach us the importance of clarity, transparency, fairness, equity, accountability, responsibility, adaptability, and flexibility. By understanding and applying these lessons, individuals can build stronger relationships, promote positive work experiences, and achieve personal and professional growth.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>You're welcome </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) Don’t Micromanage, when you micromanage, you make your employees feel like they can’t do their job. That has a negative effect on their productivity and confidence.</p><p>One of the easiest ways to give your team members a modicum of control is to let them schedule their own work hours. Software like Sling allows you, the manager, to set up the schedule so that your employees can choose when they want to work.</p><p>2.Maintain An Open-Door Policy, a great way to begin building your employee/employer relations is by maintaining an open-door policy. When your team members feel comfortable approaching you with questions, concerns, and new ideas, a natural give-and-take develops. That then serves to strengthen your employee/employer relations.</p><p>3.Communicate With Your Employees Face-To-Face,Don’t let your reliance on digital communication like email, texting, instant messaging, and webcams get in the way of face-to-face, in-person communication. Talk to your employees directly. Give them assignments personally rather than just through email.</p><p>Engage your team members in personal conversations to find out how they’re doing. When you’re physically present in your team members’ lives, your relationship will improve.</p><p>4.Conduct Performance Reviews, performance reviews may not sound like a way to build strong employee/employer relations, but, done right, they can forge a bond between you and your team that will inspire them to greatness.</p><p>Schedule performance reviews at least every six months (once a quarter is even better). During these reviews, try to focus on the positive rather than always spotlighting the negative.</p><p>5.Delegate ,when you delegate, you give employees the opportunity to get a feel for your responsibilities. This serves to teach them about what goes on in the business around them, and it helps you all understand where the team’s strengths and weaknesses lie.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
