Along with the current spread of COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing and face masks wearing to public and private schools are compulsory once classes are resumed or started. Governments around the world have issued policies and guidelines to implement physical distancing in order to flatten the pandemic curve (Greenstone &amp;amp; Nigam, 2020; Thunstrom et al., 2020). In addition, wearing of face masks or even personal protective equipment (PPE) as a public health intervention would probably intercept the transmission link and prevent communicable diseases (Huang, 2020). Thus, students, faculty members and non-teaching staff should be required to wear face masks and maintain physical distancing with each other when going to schools. In addition, they will be required to strictly follow hygienic practices, health protocols and other precautionary measures such as contact tracing, foot baths, sanitation and frequent handwashing. One of the challenges of schools is to reduce student-teacher ratio which will lead to problems like lack of classrooms and other physical plants and facilities, lack of teachers and lack of learning materials. Nonetheless, public health is a concern.

Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</a>

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

Along with the current spread of COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing and face masks wearing to public and private schools are compulsory once classes are resumed or started. Governments around the world have issued policies and guidelines to implement physical distancing in order to flatten the pandemic curve (Greenstone &amp; Nigam, 2020; Thunstrom et al., 2020). In addition, wearing of face masks or even personal protective equipment (PPE) as a public health intervention would probably intercept the transmission link and prevent communicable diseases (Huang, 2020). Thus, students, faculty members and non-teaching staff should be required to wear face masks and maintain physical distancing with each other when going to schools. In addition, they will be required to strictly follow hygienic practices, health protocols and other precautionary measures such as contact tracing, foot baths, sanitation and frequent handwashing. One of the challenges of schools is to reduce student-teacher ratio which will lead to problems like lack of classrooms and other physical plants and facilities, lack of teachers and lack of learning materials. Nonetheless, public health is a concern.

                            2. What are the 3 claims in ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY ON CYBERBULLYING.
Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</h2><br />

                            5. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.
