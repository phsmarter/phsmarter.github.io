                        <p>Personal values are the beliefs and principles that guide an individual's decision-making and behavior in life. They are the foundational principles that shape our lives and help us to find meaning and purpose in what we do. In this essay, I will discuss my personal values and the importance they have in shaping my beliefs and actions.</p><p></p><p>Honesty is one of the most important values for me. I believe that being honest with myself and others builds trust, respect, and helps to create harmonious relationships. In my personal and professional life, I have always strived to be honest in my interactions with others, even if it may be difficult or uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Integrity is another value that is important to me. Integrity involves having strong moral principles and being able to stand by them when faced with ethical dilemmas. I believe that integrity is what defines who we are and what we stand for. It is important that I act in a way that reflects honesty, respect, and fairness in all that I do.</p><p></p><p>Respect is another value that I hold dear. I believe that everyone should be treated equally, regardless of their background, culture, or lifestyle. Respecting others' opinions and values is an essential aspect of building a strong and harmonious community. It is important to me that I respect others and that I am respected in return.</p><p></p><p>Compassion is a value that helps me to connect with others on a deeper level. I believe that showing compassion towards others helps build relationships and shows that we care about one another.</p><br />

You gain knowledge, skills and experience to help you both in your career and in life in general.

It plays a great role in our career growth as well as in the personal growth. It has no limitation; people of any age group can get education anytime. It helps us to determine about good and bad things. Goals are crucial to school success (and areas of life beyond the classroom). Setting and tracking goals helps your child learn important life skills such as planning, organization, and time management while also building communication skills, self-awareness, and confidence.</p><p></p><p>Those who get an education have higher incomes, have more opportunities in their lives, and tend to be healthier. Societies benefit as well. Societies with high rates of education completion have lower crime, better overall health, and civic involvement. Lack of access to education is considered the root of poverty.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You must first be held responsible for all your actions or inactions. You must step up and finally admit what it is that is holding you back from developing into the person you want to become. For those seeking better money management, admit your splurges, learn how to control or if possible, eliminate some of them altogether, and then you can accomplish a greater sense of satisfaction at the end of the month, instead of spending time on the phone, making arrangements with creditors because you’ve overspent your budget.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It's on you on what you achieved from what you did.</p><p></p><br />

Burnout; Nervous Breakdown; Major Depressive Episode. The health professionals all had different labels. The truth was, I was broken. Pride comes before the fall. Here was the inevitable fall. In the matter of a single moment sitting in front of my computer screen, my entire life changed course. Nothing would ever be the same again. I did not realize it at the time and thought that a day off was all that was required. It was not to be. The psychologist had a serious talk to me and I realized the seriousness of the situation I found myself in. I kept wondering how I had missed all the signs? It was plain to see, constant high blood pressure, inability to sleep, growing anxiety, lack of boundaries, stress, the list was almost endless.</p><p></p><p>My journey had begun.</p><p></p><p>For the first time that I can recall I had no destination in mind. I was broken. I did not want to be anywhere or do anything. I had lost the will to live and I didn’t care. Looking back at that time I don’t even recall having thoughts. I either lay in bed or sat on a chair under a blanket. I simply existed, as if in some strange comatose state, whether this was brought on by the breakdown or the handful of tablets that I was required to take every day I am not sure. None the less I was little more than an inanimate object. My fiancé took great care of me, prepared meals, handled whatever business fallouts were taking place, encouraging me to rest and give it time, inviting me to try to make tiny steps towards recovery.</p><p></p><p>This was not how I imagined the journey would be. After all, when they say that it is about the journey, not the destination, one would think that the journey should at least be enjoyable. I could find absolutely no joy in anything.</p><p></p><p>There is also a saying that: “every cloud has a silver lining.” Fortunately, that has also proven to be true for me. My brother in law bought me a return ticket to go visit them in India, and I accepted the gift as I needed to just get away from the world. In March this year, I nervously embarked on a journey to go spend some time with them in India. I did not have any plans to do anything in India, and the main reason for me going was just to get away from everything for a while. Even if the only thing I did whilst I was in India was stay in their house for 6 weeks that would have worked for me.</p><p></p><p>Something inside me shifted though. The moment I said goodbye to my fiancé and stepdaughter and walked through to departures I knew that I was on my own from here. I knew that it was now up to me to create the context for how this journey would unfold.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong># Carry On learning</strong><br />

                        <p> "My Personal Financial Goals in Life"</p><p></p><p>Figuring out where you will be financially years from now is hard to imagine. There are always what you plan, and then there’s things that just happen that you would usually rather not have of. You can always make goals and things and hope that things go alright and end up close to what you expected. </p><p>I am currently eighteen years old. I am working on setting up all my financial things so that I am independent and can rely on myself for what I need and not have to worry about having my parents approving of things and being responsible for what I choose to do. I am going to take out a small loan soon and work on building up my credit history. I am also planning on transferring all my things like my car and phone to my name. This summer I…show more content…</p><p>I will then purchase my own house and also a car. I will be paying insurance on both of these items. I will work the rest of my life as a Nurse and will eventually retire at the age of 65.</p><p>Although I don’t really know how well all of this will work out and I’m sure there are probably easier ways to do all this, I don’t think I will be talking to any professionals. I think I have enough basic understanding in order to keep myself stable. Granted I will probably fall a couple of times and make a few mistakes, I’ve been taught to keep working at it and you’ll get it right eventually. I know that in order to get what you want you have to try and work really hard. I don’t believe in being handed things, whether it be money or advice or anything else. I would rather try and fail then have someone tell me what to and what not to do. </p><p> I myself believe in risks to an extent. I think they are alright as long as they are somewhat logical. I don’t believe in “jumping off a cliff with no ropes hoping to survive”. I plan on having two accounts, one checking and one savings. I will mainly work with my checking account and the savings will not be touched unless for emergencies. I will keep a minimum of a thousand dollars in my savings account, which I will be opening at a credit union since they have a slightly higher interest rate, so I will always have it. I have learned to always keep a “safe".</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My childhood memories (personal recount)</p><p></p><p>Childhood is a precious time that shapes the person we become. Looking back, I can vividly recall many fond memories from my early years. The carefree days of playing with friends, exploring the outdoors, and enjoying the simple pleasures of life.</p><p></p><p>One of my fondest memories is the times I spent with my grandfather. He was a kind and gentle man, who always had a twinkle in his eye and a story to tell. Whenever I visited him, he would take me on long walks in the countryside, pointing out all the plants and animals we came across.</p><p></p><p>Another treasured memory is the summer vacations spent at my aunt's farm. We would spend the days picking fresh fruits and vegetables, feeding the animals, and playing in the open fields. At night, we would gather around the campfire and listen to my uncle's stories about his travels around the world.</p><p></p><p>I also have memories of my school days, the excitement of learning new things, the thrill of participating in sports, and the joy of making new friends. There were times when I struggled with my studies, but my parents and teachers were always there to support and guide me.</p><p></p><p>As I grew older, life became more complex, and I began to appreciate the simplicity of those childhood days. The memories of those carefree days have stayed with me, providing a source of comfort and inspiration during the challenges of adult life.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, childhood memories are an integral part of our lives, shaping our identity and providing a foundation for the future. I cherish the memories of my childhood and the people who helped make it such a special time.</p><br />

                        <p>        Before the pandemic started life was normal; woking up everyday early in the morning so that I wouldn't be late at school, going for groceries or shopping with my mom, riding public vehicles regardless of the overcrowded seat, going out with my friends, doing our group activities in our classmate's house, and etc. Then all of a sudden the people were scared because of the bad news that was spreading, and I am one of them. We can't deny the fact that it really ruined not just us but also the lives of people in the whole wide world. COVID–19 virus gave us the alarming feeling and thoughts. Stress, anxiety, sadness and fear engulfed each and everyone of us.The coronavirus crisis is unlike anything we've experienced before. One of the scariest things is the uncertainty. </p><p>        Everything keeps changing: just when it feels like things might be getting better, they seem to get worse again. But aside from that, this pandemic also gives us lots of realizations and lessons. For instance, it made us realized that life is very important. We were afraid that our selves or our own loved ones might get infected by the virus. The virus built us to be stronger than before because we never know what could possibly happen in our lives. This pandemic has made me become aware of certain things in life. I’ve realized that as a society we have not placed a high importance on things that actually matter, such as mental health and environmental health.</p><p>It changed the way we think and act, moreover, we built the better version of ourselves.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>P.S</strong></p><p>Dunno how many words I've created 'coz I'm so lazy counting them kaya ikaw na bahala magbilang haha</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

By doing so, I hope to gain a broader perspective of the industry and the different career paths that I can pursue.</p><p></p><p>My second goal is to develop my professional skills and work habits. I want to learn how to communicate effectively with colleagues and clients, manage my time efficiently, and be a productive member of the team. I also want to learn about the ethical and legal standards that govern the workplace and develop a strong work ethic.</p><p></p><p>Finally, my goal is to build a network of professional contacts and mentors who can guide me in my future career. I want to take advantage of this opportunity to meet and learn from experienced professionals who can share their knowledge and experience with me.</p><br />
