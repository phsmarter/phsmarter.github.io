Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                                            Rizal’s Letter: To the Young Women of Malolos(excerpt)When I wrote Noli Me Tangere, I asked myself whether bravery was a common thing in the young women of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seem to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so called “spiritual fathers” (as if the spirit or soul had any father other than God), due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. They seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.However, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its young women, except one called Emila [Emilia Tiongson, whom Rizal met in 1887], and her I knew by name only.Now that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipina stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosarios, and grimy scapularies [religious garment showing devotion], but in a spotless conduct, firm intention, and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the little tin god, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each individual reason and a will of his or her own to distinguish the just from the unjust; all were born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another your thoughts. And, why should you submit to another your thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?THIS SUBJECT IS "21ST CENTURY LITERATURE"Question:Base on the first paragraph, how did jose rizal describe the filipino wowen?​</a>

                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                            16. Rizal’s Letter: To the Young Women of Malolos(excerpt)When I wrote Noli Me Tangere, I asked myself whether bravery was a common thing in the young women of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seem to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so called “spiritual fathers” (as if the spirit or soul had any father other than God), due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. They seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.However, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its young women, except one called Emila [Emilia Tiongson, whom Rizal met in 1887], and her I knew by name only.Now that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipina stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosarios, and grimy scapularies [religious garment showing devotion], but in a spotless conduct, firm intention, and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the little tin god, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each individual reason and a will of his or her own to distinguish the just from the unjust; all were born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another your thoughts. And, why should you submit to another your thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?THIS SUBJECT IS "21ST CENTURY LITERATURE"Question:Base on the first paragraph, how did jose rizal describe the filipino wowen?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In the first paragraph of the letter "To the Young Women of Malolos," Jose Rizal described the young women of his time as having agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but with an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so-called "spiritual fathers." He also remarked that they seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap. Rizal observed that the young women of his time lacked bravery and seemed to be living in servitude, which was due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. He was looking for young women who would come up to his ideal, and at first, he thought there were only a few.</p><br />

                            25. Activity 2: Writers often use analogies to bring their piece to life, so let's take a look at someclassic analogy examples in literature and poetry. The analogy used is underlined. Tellwhether the meaning stated is correct or incorrect. Write C if it is the correct meaning, and !if it is not1. "Memory is to love what the saucer is to the cup." (The House in Paris, ElizabethBowen)It compares the relationship between a cup and saucer to that of love andmemory: memory holds on to love, as a saucer holds the cup.2. "It has been well said that an  author who expects results from a first novel is in aposition similar to that of a man who drops a rose petal down the Grand Canyonof Arizona and listens for the echo." (Cocktail Time, P.G. Wodehouse)It compares the response to a writer's first novel to a petal dropping into theGrand Canyon; there's nothing to hear, no great acclaim.3. She was as quiet as a church mouse.She is a mouse living in a church.4. Life is like a race.• It compares life to a race, that there is always a competition.5. Finding a good man is like finding a needle in a haystack.It means that good people are in the haystack.6. How a doctor diagnoses diseases is like how a detective investigates crimes.A doctor is compared to a detective who investigates and tries to find thepossible suspect; while he makes a diagnosis.7.

                        <p><strong>: Answer ꒱꒱ ̣ ̟</strong></p><strong>_C  </strong>1. "Memory is to love what the saucer is to the cup." (The House in Paris, Elizabeth Bowen)It compares the relationship between a cup and saucer to that of love and memory: memory holds on to love, as a saucer holds the cup._C  2. "It has been well said that an author who expects results from a first novel is in a position similar to that of a man who drops a rose petal down the Grand Canyon of Arizona and listens for the echo." (Cocktail Time, P.G. Wodehouse)It compares the response to a writer's first novel to a petal dropping into the Grand Canyon; there's nothing to hear, no great acclaim.<strong>_!   </strong>3. She was as quiet as a church mouse.She is a mouse living in a church (incorrect). Saying "quiet as a church mouse" is only a metaphor to describe how quiet she is.<p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>_C  </strong>4. Life is like a race.It compares life to a race, that there is always a competition.<strong>_!   </strong>5. Finding a good man is like finding a needle in a haystack.It means that good people are in the haystack (incorrect). This statement means that finding a good man is difficult, which is similar to trying to look for a needle in a pile of hay.<strong>_C  </strong>6. How a doctor diagnoses diseases is like how a detective investigates crimes.A doctor is compared to a detective who investigates and tries to find the possible suspect; while he makes a diagnosis.<strong>_!   </strong>7. That couple is sweet as sugar.The couple tastes like sugar (incorrect). The explanation behind this is simple -- sugar is sweet, and the couple being described is as sweet as sugar. This analogy means that the couple looks good together and act lovingly toward each other.<strong>_C   </strong>8. They crowded very close about him, with their hands always on him in a careful, caressing grip, as though all the while feeling him make sure he was there. It was like men handling a fish that is still alive and may jump back into the water. (George Orwell, A Hanging)Orwell is describing the crowd's reaction to seeing a man hanged.<strong>_C  </strong>9. Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water.It compares the "fin of the shark" to "a black chip". Black chips are used in poker and are considered to hold a large sum of money.<strong>_!   </strong>10. She felt like a raft floating in the middle of a dark, endless ocean. Like her, the raft was floating along, alone, worn out, and unable to reach a steady place in which to settle.She feels really happy (incorrect). By using context clues like "dark, endless" and "alone, worn out...", we can conclude that she is in fact, the opposite of happy. She feels depressed and hopeless, ouch.​<p>—————————— /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\ ——————————</p><p><strong>        Click the link below to learn more!</strong></p><p>Definition and Importance of Analogy - https://brainly.ph/question/3966030</p><p></p><p>Work hard like a beaver, rest well like a sloth! ଘ(੭ˊᵕˋ)੭* ੈ✩‧₊˚</p><p>#BrainliestBunch</p><br />

                            28. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I will agree with this, considering that religion plays a significant role in human society and culture. It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />
