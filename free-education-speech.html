My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time.

By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses.

taken from his privilege speech delivered in 1933. Then, answer the 
questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. 
“I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher 
in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. 
My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare 
rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and 
during my early youth, my father saved as much as he 
could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos 
with which to give me an education. During those 
Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small 
town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, 
did my family live for years. When I was at the age of 
five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father 
and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary 
instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and 
began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived 
in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who 
could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My 
classes started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very 
early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the 
following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an 
intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest 
honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my 
education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my 
studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came 
to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had 
become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a 
lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me 
as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board 
and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.”

                                            WHAT'S NEW Read the excerpt below. Observe the flow of ideas in the paragraph. Nelson Mandela's speech at the opening of the defense case in the Rivonia Trial, Pretoria, South Africa, 20 April 1964."The complaint of Africans ... is not only that they are poor and the whites are rich, but that the laws which are made by the whites are designed to preserve this situation. There are two ways to break out of poverty. The first is by formal education, and the second is by the worker acquiring a greater skill at his work and thus higher wages. As far as Africans are concerned, both these avenues of advancement are deliberately curtailed by legislation. ... Above all, we want equal political rights, because without them, our disabilities will be permanent. I know this sounds revolutionary to the whites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans. This makes the white man fear democracy. But this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution which will guarantee racial harmony and freedom for all. It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another. The ANC* has spent half a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs, it will not change that policy. This then is what the ANC is fighting. Their struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by their own suffering and their own experience. It is a struggle for the right to live. During my lifetime, I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which am prepared to die.'*ANC is - African National Congress, a South African political party and black nationalist organization​</a>

rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and 
during my early youth, my father saved as much as he 
could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos 
with which to give me an education. During those 
Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small 
town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, 
did my family live for years. When I was at the age of 
five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father 
and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary 
instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and 
began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived 
in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who 
could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My 
classes started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very 
early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the 
following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an 
intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest 
honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my 
education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my 
studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came 
to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had 
become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a 
lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me 
as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board 
and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                            19. WHAT'S NEW Read the excerpt below. Observe the flow of ideas in the paragraph. Nelson Mandela's speech at the opening of the defense case in the Rivonia Trial, Pretoria, South Africa, 20 April 1964."The complaint of Africans ... is not only that they are poor and the whites are rich, but that the laws which are made by the whites are designed to preserve this situation. There are two ways to break out of poverty. The first is by formal education, and the second is by the worker acquiring a greater skill at his work and thus higher wages. As far as Africans are concerned, both these avenues of advancement are deliberately curtailed by legislation. ... Above all, we want equal political rights, because without them, our disabilities will be permanent. I know this sounds revolutionary to the whites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans. This makes the white man fear democracy. But this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution which will guarantee racial harmony and freedom for all. It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another. The ANC* has spent half a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs, it will not change that policy. This then is what the ANC is fighting. Their struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by their own suffering and their own experience. It is a struggle for the right to live. During my lifetime, I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which am prepared to die.'*ANC is - African National Congress, a South African political party and black nationalist organization​</h2><br />
