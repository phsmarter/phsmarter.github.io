You can give some situations and experiences to support your answers.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Since main points are discrete and interconnected ideas, and since every speech contains more than one main point, it is necessary to strategically make connections between one point and another. To link the ideas of your speech, you will need to develop signposts, “words and gestures that allow you to move smoothly from one idea to the next throughout your speech, showing relationships between ideas and emphasizing important points.”[1] There are several ways to incorporate signposts into your speech, and it is important to do so since these small signals keep listeners engaged and informed about where you are in the speech. Transitional statements, internal previews, and summaries are all signposts that can help keep your speech moving along.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO PLSSS</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Beauty is a highly subjective concept that can be difficult to define. However, most people would agree that it refers to qualities that are pleasing or attractive to the senses. Beauty is often associated with features such as symmetry, balance, and proportion, as well as qualities like kindness, compassion, and grace. In many cultures, beauty is also linked to cultural ideals and standards, which can vary widely.</p><p></p><p>One interesting aspect of beauty is that it is often closely tied to our emotions. When we see something that we find beautiful, we may feel a sense of joy or peace. This emotional response to beauty may be hardwired into our brains, as research has shown that the areas of the brain responsible for emotion and pleasure are activated when we experience beauty. Ultimately, beauty is a deeply personal and subjective experience, and what one person finds beautiful may be completely different from what another person finds attractive.</p><p></p><br />

It uses the complex grammatical sentence structure and vocabulary that are only known by experts in that field</p><p>2.)Formal Style</p><p>This type uses formal words and expressions and is mostly seen in writing rather than speaking. It also disallows the use of ellipsis, contractions, and qualifying modal adverbials.</p><p>3.)Consultative Style</p><p>The third level of language. It is basically unplanned speech since the speaker uses the participation and feedback of the listener. The speaker will supply background information, while again, the listener participates continuously</p><p>4.)Casual Style</p><p>Also known as informal style, it is usually used between, friends, or even insiders who have things to share. In this type, there is a free and easy participation of both speaker and listener.</p><p>5.)Intimate Style</p><p>The last type is used in talks between two very close individuals. It is described by an economy of words, with a high chance of nonverbal communication. Like casual, there is also a free and easy participation of both speaker and listener.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>just giving a clue</p><p></p><br />
