                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cultural patterns are influenced by multiple factors, including ethnicity, race, SES, education, gender roles, sexual orientation, country of origin, current residence, migration, religious and political affiliations, and family life cycle stage.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa Brainliest</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Culture is a belief about ethics, behaviors and values that are held by a majority of people within a society. The culture of which we are a part impacts our identity and even our beliefs about the nature of life. The type of culture either Individualistic or Collective into which a person is born affects and influences what that person believes and how that person behaves. For example, someone growing up in a “tight” (Collective) culture, where rules are strongly enforced, does not support individualistic thought or behavior.</p><p></p><p>However, persons who are raised in a “loose” (Individualistic) culture have more latitude in how they behave and what they believe. Loose cultures are more prominent in western societies like America. These cultures are based on the belief that a person’s life belongs to that person, which is in alignment with the founding fathers’ Bill of Rights.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Collective cultures believe a person’s first obligation is to society. And, they must sacrifice their needs to benefit the greater good. When rules of thought and behavior are more rigid, it is a Collective society.</p><p></p><p>Every culture has aspects of Individualistic and Collectivistic beliefs, but in Individualistic cultures more value is placed on being extroverted. Individualistic cultures find people to be more open than Collectivistic cultures. And, Collectivistic cultures support a more introverted personality style and encourage behaviors that are representative of the majority of people. Collectivistic cultures are good at seeing other people’s perspective to foster group harmony, whereas there is not as much in Individualistic cultures.</p><br />

                        <p>1. The elements present in the pattern are triangles, regular hexagons, squares, parallelograms, rectangles, rhombuses, irregular hexagons with one or two lines of symmetry, and pentagons with one line of symmetry. The principles present are repetition and symmetry.</p><p></p><p>2. The use of geometric shapes and repetition is significant to Islamic culture and tradition, as it represents the infinite nature of God and the balance and order of the universe. Islamic art also follows the principle of aniconism, which means the avoidance of depicting living beings in art. This is why Islamic art often features intricate geometric patterns instead of figurative images.</p><p></p><p>3.

Of Zimbabwe</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Despite President Emerson Mnangagwa repeatedly voicing his commitments to human rights reforms, Zimbabwe remained highly intolerant of basic rights, peaceful dissent, and free expression in 2019. During nationwide protests in mid-January, following the president’s sudden announcement of a fuel price increase, security forces responded with lethal force, killing at least 17 people, raping at least 17 women, shooting and injuring 81 people, and arresting over 1,000 suspected protesters during door-to-door raids. In the months that followed, several civil society activists, political opposition leaders, and other critics of the government were arbitrarily arrested, abducted, beaten, or tortured. Little to no efforts were made to bring those responsible for the abuses to justice.</p><p></p><p>On September 6, Zimbabwe’s long-time former ruler, Robert Mugabe, died in Singapore. Despite his 37 years in power having been marked by widespread human rights violations and the ruining of the country’s economy, Mugabe was never held to account for his corrupt and abusive rule.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I drew a pattern that resembles a dragon, and I named it "The Dragon of the Sky." To come up with this figure, I connected some of the brightest stars in the map using imaginary lines and added some curved lines to create the shape of a dragon. The head of the dragon is formed by three stars that are aligned horizontally, while its body is made up of a series of stars that curve and loop around.</p><p></p><p>According to my story, the Dragon of the Sky is a legendary creature that guards the heavens. It is said that the dragon was once a fierce warrior who was so brave that the gods decided to elevate it to the skies as a constellation. The dragon's mission is to protect the stars and ensure that they remain in their rightful place. The Dragon of the Sky is also said to bring good luck to those who spot it in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Overall, I came up with this figure by looking for stars that were in close proximity to each other and connecting them to create a shape that resembled a dragon. I chose the dragon because it is a common mythological creature that appears in many cultures around the world, and it adds a sense of mystery and intrigue to the night sky.</p><br />

For example, the Greeks called the large constellation Orion, which means hunter and is prominent in the night sky all over the world during winter.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To create my pattern in the sky, I decided to focus on the constellation Cassiopeia, which is visible in the northern hemisphere during autumn and winter. Cassiopeia is easily recognizable as a "W" shape in the sky, and it is named after a queen from Greek mythology who was punished for her vanity.</p><p></p><p>Using my markers, I drew the "W" shape of Cassiopeia on my map of stars, and then I added some additional stars around it to create a larger figure. I named this pattern "Cassiopeia's Throne," and I imagined it as a majestic seat made of stars that the queen herself might have sat upon.</p><p></p><p>As for my bases for coming up with this figure, I was inspired by the shape of Cassiopeia itself and its association with royalty. I wanted to create a larger pattern that would reflect this sense of grandeur and power, so I added some extra stars to make it look more like a throne. Finally, I decided to name it after Cassiopeia to tie it back to the original constellation and its mythology.</p><p></p><p>In my story about Cassiopeia's Throne, I imagined that the queen herself had created this pattern in the sky as a way to symbolize her power and authority. Whenever her subjects looked up at the night sky and saw her throne shining brightly, they would be reminded of her strength and leadership. Over time, the pattern became associated with Cassiopeia's legacy, and it continued to shine in the sky for generations to come.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Japan</p><p>2. China</p><p>3. Saudi Arabia</p><p>4. India</p><p>5. Italy</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Japan: In Japan, greetings are an important part of the culture, and they often involve bowing. The depth and length of the bow depend on the social status and relationship between the people involved. Handshakes are also becoming more common, especially in business settings.</p><p></p><p>2. China: In China, greetings are also important and can vary depending on the region and the person's social status. The most common greeting is a handshake, but it is not as firm as in Western cultures. In more formal settings, people may bow slightly or nod their head.</p><p></p><p>3. Saudi Arabia: In Saudi Arabia, greetings are an important part of the culture and can be quite formal. Men typically greet other men with a handshake, while women usually greet other women with a kiss on the cheek. However, men and women do not typically shake hands or touch each other in public.</p><p></p><p>4. India: In India, greetings are often accompanied by the gesture of placing one's hands together in front of the chest and bowing slightly, known as "Namaste." This gesture is used to show respect and is used in both formal and informal settings.</p><p></p><p>5. Italy: In Italy, greetings are often warm and friendly, with hugs, kisses on the cheek, and handshakes being common. Italians place a high value on personal relationships and are often more expressive and emotional than people from other cultures.</p><p></p><p>In general, it's important to research the cultural norms and expectations of a country before traveling there or doing business with people from that culture. Greetings are just one aspect of communication that can differ greatly from one culture to another. Understanding these differences and adapting to them can help build better relationships and avoid misunderstandings.</p><br />
