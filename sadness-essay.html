And the woods must be cold and silent, Before the robins sing, The flowers must be buried in darkness, Before they can bud and bloom. And the sweetest and warmest sunshine, Comes after the storm and gloom. So, the heart, from the hardest trial, Gains the purest joy of all. And from the lips that have tasted sadness, The sweetest songs will fall. For as peace comes after suffering, And love is reward of pain So, after earth, comes Heaven, And out of loss, is gain.​</a>

                            5.  Analyze and understand the poem then write reflection essay with 350-400 words "LESSONS ON EXPERIENCE" We must live through the weary winter, If we would value spring. And the woods must be cold and silent, Before the robins sing, The flowers must be buried in darkness, Before they can bud and bloom. And the sweetest and warmest sunshine, Comes after the storm and gloom. So, the heart, from the hardest trial, Gains the purest joy of all. And from the lips that have tasted sadness, The sweetest songs will fall. For as peace comes after suffering, And love is reward of pain So, after earth, comes Heaven, And out of loss, is gain.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>jsoe0292929jdnfnf</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The poem "Lessons on Experience" by an anonymous author is a reflective piece that highlights the value of enduring difficult experiences in order to appreciate the beauty and joy that follow. The poem speaks of the natural cycles of life, where every pleasant experience is preceded by a period of hardship, sorrow, or pain.</p><p></p><p>The first stanza compares the winter to the spring, and how one cannot truly appreciate the latter without having gone through the former. It also mentions the quietness of the woods before the birds start singing, reminding us that sometimes silence is necessary before something beautiful can happen. The second stanza speaks of the darkness that flowers must be buried in before they can bloom, and how the sunshine that follows a storm is the sweetest and warmest.</p><p></p><p>The third stanza shifts the focus to the human heart, which gains the purest joy of all from enduring the hardest trials. The poem suggests that it is through pain and sadness that we can truly appreciate and express happiness and joy. The final stanza reinforces this idea by suggesting that peace and love are the rewards of suffering, and that Heaven comes after life on earth, and gain is born out of loss.</p><p></p><p>The poem's message resonates with me on a personal level. I have gone through some difficult experiences in my life, but looking back, I realize that those experiences have helped me grow and become a stronger person. I have learned to appreciate the good things in life more deeply because of the hardships I have endured. The poem reminds me that even in difficult times, there is hope for a brighter future.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "Lessons on Experience" is a poignant reminder that we must endure difficult experiences in order to truly appreciate the beauty and joy that life has to offer. The poem's message is one that can provide comfort and hope to anyone going through a difficult time. It encourages us to embrace the challenges we face and to trust that they will ultimately lead us to a better place.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One happy experience that I had with the practice of community action's core values was when I volunteered for a local environmental organization. The organization was focused on promoting sustainable living and reducing the community's carbon footprint. As a volunteer, I had the opportunity to work alongside other like-minded individuals who were passionate about creating positive change in our community.</p><p></p><p>One of the core values that was evident in our work was collaboration. We worked together as a team to plan and execute various projects, such as community clean-up days and educational workshops. Everyone had a role to play, and we all worked together to achieve our goals. I felt a strong sense of camaraderie and connection with my fellow volunteers, and it was incredibly satisfying to see the positive impact that our efforts had on the community.</p><p></p><p>Another core value that we practiced was accountability. We were accountable to each other and to the community for the work that we did. We were transparent about our goals and our progress, and we welcomed feedback and input from others. This created a sense of trust and mutual respect among our team members and the community we served.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, not all experiences with community action are positive. I once had a sad experience with the malpractice of core values when I volunteered for a different organization. This organization was focused on providing support to individuals and families experiencing homelessness. While the mission of the organization was admirable, I quickly realized that their practices did not align with their stated values.</p><p></p><p>One core value that was particularly lacking was respect. The organization's staff and volunteers often spoke about the people they were helping in a condescending or dismissive manner. They seemed more focused on "fixing" people's problems rather than treating them with dignity and respect. This was particularly upsetting to me because I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with compassion and empathy, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my experiences with the practice of community action's core values have been mostly positive. I have seen firsthand how collaboration, accountability, and respect can create positive change in our communities. However, it is important to be aware that not all organizations live up to their stated values, and it is essential to hold them accountable for their actions. By working together and holding each other accountable, we can create a more just and equitable world.</p><p></p>Follow And Brainliest <br />

Are rich people really happy because they have everything? Are poor people really sad because they don't have anything? Explain. your answer.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:1.Socioeconomic status is the position of an individual or group on the socioeconomic scale, which is determined by a combination of social and economic factors such as income, amount and kind of education, type and prestige of occupation, place of residence, and—in some societies or parts of society—ethnic origin or ... 2.iin fact, new research shows that richer and poorer people are generally as happy as each other. Where they differ is in their level of sadness: higher-income individuals are markedly less sad on a daily basis.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: Thanks</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. There are various ways to identify the economic status of one's family. Here are some common methods:</p><p></p><p>Income: One of the most common indicators of economic status is income. Income can be determined by looking at the amount of money that a family earns from various sources such as salaries, wages, bonuses, and investments.</p><p></p><p>Education: Education can also be a good indicator of economic status. Families with higher levels of education tend to have higher paying jobs and better access to resources.</p><p></p><p>Occupation: The occupation of the head of the household or the primary breadwinner can also give an indication of economic status. Certain occupations such as doctors, lawyers, and engineers tend to have higher incomes than others.</p><p></p><p>Assets: The assets that a family owns can also provide an indication of economic status. Assets may include real estate, vehicles, stocks, bonds, and other investments.</p><p></p><p>Living conditions: The living conditions of a family can also give an indication of economic status. Families living in larger houses or in expensive neighborhoods may have a higher economic status.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that these indicators should not be used in isolation and should be considered together to get a more accurate picture of a family's economic status.</p><p></p><p>2. The relationship between wealth and happiness is complex and not straightforward. While it is true that having a certain level of financial security can alleviate some of the stresses and anxieties associated with poverty, it does not necessarily guarantee happiness.</p><p></p><p>Research has shown that once basic needs are met, such as food, shelter, and safety, additional wealth has diminishing returns in terms of happiness. This means that beyond a certain point, having more money does not necessarily lead to greater happiness. In fact, studies have shown that some extremely wealthy individuals experience higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression than their less affluent counterparts.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, being poor can certainly contribute to a sense of sadness, stress, and uncertainty, as financial struggles can make it difficult to meet basic needs and achieve long-term goals. However, many individuals who are living in poverty still find joy and contentment in their lives, as they may have strong relationships, a sense of purpose, and a deep appreciation for the simple things in life.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, happiness is a complex and multifaceted emotion that is influenced by a wide range of factors, including personal values, life circumstances, and social support. While wealth can contribute to happiness in certain ways, it is by no means a guarantee, and individuals who are living in poverty can still find meaning and fulfillment in their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
