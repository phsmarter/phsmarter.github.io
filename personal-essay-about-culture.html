                                            Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2. What way of organizing a comparison and contrast is shown in paragraph 1? In paragraph 2? 3.-4. What transitional words or cohesive devices are used in paragraph1? What about in paragraph 2?​</a>

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others.

                                            Jesus Christ is one of the most popular figures of history and religion. Though the historical evidence of him living is not so substantial, there is enough data to claim he was a real person. However, with his existence assured by information outside the Bible, there are still many mysteries about him. One such conundrum is when he was born. In fact, “when was Jesus born” is a top search on the internet. There are many theories about when he was born in terms of the year and month, and even day. These theories have been clouded by popular myths, cultural norms, and a lack of concrete evidence. However, this essay will delve into the various theories behind his birthdate and try to get to the bottom of the question.

Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Music seems to be a key to identity because it offers, to intensely, a sense of both self and the collective. Social groups only get to know themselves as groups (as a particular organization of individual and social interests, of sameness and differences) through cultural activity and in this case it would be music.</p><br />

                            2. Write an essay about how do you think the society and culture shape you as a person​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Identity, at its core, is the understanding of what someone or something is. This understanding is made up of two integral parts, personal identity and social identity. Personal identity is an understanding of who you are as a person before you step into the role you play in society.  Social identity is made up of the labels projected onto a person based on how society views someone's personal identity.  </p><p></p><p>People's personal identity can be shaped in many different ways.  Three factors that are important in shaping one’s personal identity include, but are not limited to, their culture, their memories, and their societal labels. Culture, simply explained, is learned behavior and norms we apply to the situations that we are presented.  In the words of the World Youth Alliance, which is a non-profit organization whose main goal is to create a culture that supports the dignity of every human person,  “We are not alone. We live in a society, as wild as it is. We live in groups, we define ourselves through them, and hence, at least in some aspects, we belong to them.”  These groups that we live in are the cultures we create for ourselves. We do this to build social connections, which allow people to feel accepted by the general population. It is a human need to feel accepted by other people, so it is only natural for a person to gravitate to a group that is made of members that reflect their own characteristics.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana maka tulong po ako</p><p>pa brainlies po need lang po plss</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The relationship between culture and freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) is often seen as a negative one, with freedom of religion often invoked to defend human rights violations. In response, many human rights advocates draw a distinction between culture and religion, and what is insinuated is that culture is the problem, not religion. However, the reality is that in many cases, culture and religion are not so distinct, with cultural practices becoming “religionized” and religious ideas becoming part of the culture. Recognizing this relationship can open up other more positive avenues for the promotion of human rights and FoRB.</p><p></p><p>The common connection that we make between culture and freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) is often a negative one. Freedom of religion is often invoked to defend human rights violations and to protest against the introduction of provisions providing for gender equality. In response, many human rights advocates, as well as more “moderate” voices within the same religious groups as those claiming FoRB, argue that such human rights violations or discrimination against women are not actually mandated by religion, but rather they are a cultural practice. In an attempt to mitigate this clash between the universal standards of human rights and the claim to freedom of religion, a distinction is therefore drawn between culture and religion.</p><p></p><br />

                            8. Essay: 1. Is personality an innate quality or a socially developed phenomenon? Regardless of your answer, how would you go about changing another person's personality? Can you change your own personality? Support your answer? 2. If juveniles conform to norms of the culture and are still labeled delinquent, is there an explanation or excuse for their behavior? Support your answer?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Essay 1:</p><p></p><p>Personality is a complex concept that refers to the unique set of traits, behaviors, and characteristics that define an individual's pattern of thinking, feeling, and acting. There has been a long-standing debate over whether personality is an innate quality or a socially developed phenomenon. While some argue that personality is largely determined by genetics and biology, others contend that it is shaped by environmental factors, such as culture, upbringing, and socialization.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether personality is innate or socially developed, changing another person's personality is a complex and challenging process. It involves identifying the specific traits and behaviors that need to be modified, understanding the underlying factors that contribute to these traits and behaviors, and implementing strategies to promote change. Some of the techniques that can be used to change another person's personality include cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, and social skills training.</p><p></p><p>Changing one's own personality is also a challenging process, but it is possible. While some personality traits may be more difficult to change than others, research has shown that personality can be modified through intentional efforts and persistent practice. For example, individuals who are naturally introverted may be able to develop more outgoing and sociable personalities by engaging in social activities, practicing assertiveness, and challenging negative self-beliefs. However, it is important to note that changing one's personality requires a willingness to change, a clear understanding of the desired outcomes, and a commitment to sustained effort and practice.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the debate over whether personality is innate or socially developed is ongoing, but regardless of the answer, changing another person's personality is a complex process that requires careful consideration and implementation of appropriate techniques. While changing one's own personality is also challenging, it is possible through intentional effort and persistent practice.</p><p></p><p>Essay 2:</p><p></p><p>Juvenile delinquency is a complex phenomenon that has been studied from various perspectives, including psychological, sociological, and criminological. While juveniles who conform to the norms of their culture may still be labeled delinquent, there are several explanations and excuses for their behavior that should be taken into account.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary explanations for juvenile delinquency is the role of environmental factors, such as poverty, family dysfunction, and peer pressure. These factors can contribute to the development of delinquent behavior by creating a hostile and unstable environment that fosters negative attitudes and behaviors. Additionally, some juveniles may engage in delinquent behavior as a means of coping with trauma or other adverse experiences.</p><p></p><p>Another explanation for juvenile delinquency is the role of social and cultural factors. Juveniles who grow up in environments that are tolerant of deviant behavior may be more likely to engage in delinquent behavior themselves. Additionally, juveniles who are exposed to violent or criminal behavior through media or other sources may be more likely to engage in similar behavior.</p><p></p><p>While these explanations can help us understand why juveniles may engage in delinquent behavior, it is important to avoid making excuses for their behavior. Juvenile delinquency has negative consequences for both the individual and society as a whole, and it is important to hold juveniles accountable for their actions while also providing them with the support and resources they need to make positive changes.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, there are several explanations for juvenile delinquency, including environmental, social, and cultural factors. While these factors can help us understand why juveniles may engage in delinquent behavior, it is important to hold them accountable for their actions while also providing them with the support and resources they need to make positive changes</p><br />

                            14. Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2. What way of organizing a comparison and contrast is shown in paragraph 1? In paragraph 2? 3.-4. What transitional words or cohesive devices are used in paragraph1? What about in paragraph 2?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A paragraph is a group of related sentences that support one main idea. In general, paragraphs consist of three parts: the topic sentence, body sentences, and the concluding or the bridge sentence to the next paragraph or section. Paragraphs show where the subdivisions of a research paper begin and end and, thus, help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>kaya mo po yan <p> </p>I need somebody who can love me in my worsr<br />

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In our personal lives, we are constantly interacting with society and culture. These interactions shape our sense of self and shape how we view the world around us. Our culture and society create the framework for how we understand ourselves, our relationships with others, and our place in the world.</p><p></p><p>Self is a complex concept that is constantly evolving. It is influenced by our experiences, our beliefs, and our interactions with others. As we grow and develop, our self-concept changes. We learn new things about ourselves, we form new relationships, and we gain new experiences. Our culture and society also play a role in shaping our self-concept. For example, the values and beliefs of our culture shape how we view ourselves and our place in the world.</p><p></p><p>Society is the network of relationships that shape our lives. It is the collection of people and institutions that we interact with on a daily basis. Society shapes how we interact with others, how we view the world, and how we understand ourselves. Our culture and society also create the norms and expectations for how we should behave and interact with others. For example, our culture's norms for gender roles shape how we view ourselves as men and women.</p><p></p><p>Culture is the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that define a group or society. It is the shared understanding of how the world works and how we should live in it. Culture shapes how we view the world and how we understand ourselves. For example, the culture's beliefs about what is considered beautiful shape how we view ourselves and our physical appearance.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, self, society and culture are closely related. Our self-concept, our relationships with others, and our place in the world are all shaped by our interactions with society and culture. As we grow and develop, we learn new things about ourselves and the world around us, and our self-concept changes. Society and culture provide the framework for how we understand ourselves, our relationships with others, and our place in the world. Understanding these relationships can help us to better understand ourselves and the world around us.</p><p></p>Pa Brainliest po, Thanks<br />

                            28. Jesus Christ is one of the most popular figures of history and religion. Though the historical evidence of him living is not so substantial, there is enough data to claim he was a real person. However, with his existence assured by information outside the Bible, there are still many mysteries about him. One such conundrum is when he was born. In fact, “when was Jesus born” is a top search on the internet. There are many theories about when he was born in terms of the year and month, and even day. These theories have been clouded by popular myths, cultural norms, and a lack of concrete evidence. However, this essay will delve into the various theories behind his birthdate and try to get to the bottom of the question.

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</h2><br />
