                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying or electronic aggression has already been designated as a serious public health threat. Cyberbullying should also be considered as a cause for new onset psychological symptoms, somatic symptoms of unclear etiology or a drop in academic performance. Pediatricians should be trained to play a major role in caring for and supporting the social and developmental well-being of children.</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying or electronic aggression has already been designated as a serious public health threat and elicited warnings to the general public from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1]. The term appears to have been coined in 2000 in Canada by the owner of a Web site dedicated to preventing traditional (face-to-face) bullying [1]. Tokunaga defined the phenomenon as “any behavior performed through electronic or digital media by individuals or groups that repeatedly communicates hostile or aggressive messages intended to inflict harm or discomfort on others” [2]. This definition highlights several important cyberbullying features: the technology component, the hostile nature of the act, the intent to cause suffering, considered by most scholars to be crucial to the definition, and repetitiveness [1].</p><p></p><p>pwede nyo lang po isulat ng maikli</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><strong>Bullying is a very common, complex and potentially damaging form of violence among children and adolescents. Bullying is defined as unwanted, aggressive behavior, which involves a real or perceived social power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time (therefore, the definition excludes occasional or minor incidents). These actions are purposeful and intended to hurt or make the victim uncomfortable.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bullying may manifest itself in many forms. It can be physical, verbal, relational, or cyber; it can be subtle and elusive. The most common form of bullying both for boys and girls is verbal bullying such as name-calling. Although bullying is more common in schools, it can occur anywhere.  It often occurs in unstructured areas such as playgrounds, cafeterias, hallways, and buses. In recent years, cyber-bullying has received increased attention, as electronic devices have become more common. Bullying through electronic means, although prevalent, ranks third after verbal bullying and physical bullying. In general, bullying is a common type of social experience that children refer to as “getting picked on.”</strong><p></p><br />

                        <br />We are living in a world where some people think that violence is the only reason to solve every problem.  If people keep this violence around us, it’s not going to get better. Violence has been in this world for centuries now and for the same causes, to gain power of authority. Kids in schools feel superior to others by calling other kids horrible names and making fun of them. Men hit women so they can “earn” their respect back. The point is that violence won’t make you a better person, it will make you a monster and nobody likes a monster.<br /><br />There are many different kinds of violence. One of them is called bullying. The victims of this violence are mostly kids and teenagers around the ages of 10-18. Bullying is when someone says mean things to someone in person or in a social network. Most of the time it happens in the social network because kids thing that by making fun of someone in a social network area, they won’t get in trouble by an adult. This is one of the worst violence in the world because is between kids and teenagers. Most of the teenagers today have very low self-esteem because of the media. They haven’t still found what they want to do with their lives, so, by saying mean things to them, it won’t help them be successful since they think that what they are saying is true.<br /><br />There are over 3.2 million of students that are victims of bullying each year. Because of these, approximately 160,000 teens skip school every day to avoid the bullies. Some of these students drop out of school. Some schools don’t even help the victims that are been bullied. Over two-thirds of students believe that schools respond poorly to bullying, with high percentage of students believing that adult help is infrequent and ineffective. I didn’t know that harassment and bullying has been linked to 75 percent of school-shooting incidents.<br /><br />There have been many cases of suicide because of bullying. One of the recent ones was the suicide of Amanda Todd. She committed suicide on October 10, 2012 at her home in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada.  She was 16 years old when she died. On September 7, 2012, she posted a 9-minute video on YouTube titled My Story: Struggling, bullying, suicide and self-harm, which showed her using flash cards telling her experiences being bullied.  The reason she was bullied was because when she was in 7th grade, she used video chat to meet new people over the internet. People she met would always give her complements about her looks. A stranger convinced her to bare her breasts on camera. He later blackmailed her with threats to expose the topless photo to her friends unless she gave a “show”. The photo of her circulated the internet. She moved to different places to start fresh, but the individual would always disguise himself as a student coming new to school. She tried to kill herself by drinking bleach and an overdose of drugs, but it didn’t work. Students from her school would make fun of her because she failed in her suicide and in her grades. After the entire nightmare, on October 10, 2012 at about 6:00 PM, she was found hanged at her home.<br /><br />Like I said before, most of the teenagers have a very low self-esteem and by telling them mean things, they will only become worst. Everybody makes mistakes. Kids today are always in the internet and they meet strangers everyday. As a parent, you need to pay attention to everything that the kid is doing. If you don’t want to have problems like this, don’t talk to strangers over the internet. Once it’s on the internet it stays there forever.  If you see someone that is being bullied over the internet or at school, contact an adult or confront the person yourself. If we all stand up together against bullying, the world will be a better place. You might think that the one that you are making fun of is a monster because of the stuff he or she has done, but in reality, you are the monster for making them feel worst.<br /><br />Be the change of a good person dont wait for the time that everyone leaves you<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abstract</p><p>During the school years, bullying is one of the most common expressions of violence in the peer context. Research on bullying started more than forty years ago, when the phenomenon was defined as ‘aggressive, intentional acts carried out by a group or an individual repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him- or herself’. Three criteria are relevant in order to define aggressive behaviour as bullying: (1) repetition, (2) intentionality and (3) an imbalance of power. Given these characteristics, bullying is often defined as systematic abuse of power by peers. It is recognised globally as a complex and serious problem. In the present paper, we discuss the prevalence, age and gender differences, and various types of bullying, as well as why it happens and how long it lasts, starting from the large surveys carried out in western countries and to a lower extent in low- and middle-income countries.</p><br />

I don't know why do that to me. They maybe are envy, and find fault against me to destroy my name.

However, when the bully starts to instill fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to property of another student. creates a hostile environment for the victim, or substantially disrupts the education process or orderly operation of the school, then the bully must be subject to disciplinary measures (Section 3(b), Rule II, Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 10627).</p><p>It is interesting to note that the word “bully” was used five hundred years ago as a term of endearment; derived from the Dutch word “boel” for brother, or the German “buhle” for lover.
