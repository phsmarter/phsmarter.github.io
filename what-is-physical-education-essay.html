                                            What I Can Do It is already the second or third month that the school has implemented the flexible learning approach. Instead of going physically to school, you continue learning your subjects at home, either through online classes or printed modules you receive every one or two weeks. The Department of Education would like to know how many students, like you, understand the current situation surrounding the flexible learning approach for this school year. The authorities requested the schools if the students can write an essay about this. You decided that it will be best to write a cause-and-effect essay discussing what leads to the using of a flexible learning approach.​</a>

                            2. What are the importance of physical education? (essay)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>I</strong><strong>mportance of physical education</strong></p><p></p><p>Physical education is a vital aspect of the general education system because it provides students with knowledge and experience concerning physical and mental wellness. The education system should encourage physical education to help students understand the importance of physical activity and provide them with opportunities for healthy development. Physical education is often viewed as less important than other fields of study, such as science, mathematics, or history. However, the benefits of physical education are undeniable.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant benefits of physical education is that it helps students maintain good physical health. Physical education teaches students about the importance of exercise and the effects of a sedentary lifestyle. It assists students in achieving developmental milestones and leads to stronger, healthier muscles, bones, and joints. It can also help individuals reduce the incidence of obesity and other health problems that result from a lack of physical activity.</p><p></p><p>Physical education also teaches students social and teamwork skills. It is an excellent avenue for young people to learn the art of communication, respect for others, and perseverance. It is also a way for students to experience camaraderie, learn how to participate in group activities, and work toward common goals. Physical education teaches students that being active involves more than just physical activity; it also promotes mental and emotional health.</p><p></p><p>Physical education strengthens the intellectual, psychological, and emotional development of students. Academic performance improves when students engage in physical activity; this is because physical activity enables the brain to work better, allowing the student to focus and learn more effectively. Physical activity also reduces stress, anxiety, and tension. Participating in physical education is an excellent way for students to reduce these psychological and emotional pressures, thereby enhancing their quality of life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, physical education leads to a more active and healthy lifestyle. The skills and knowledge developed through physical education can be applied to daily routines, which leads to a lifetime of healthy habits. The lessons and exercises that students learn in physical education classes lead to better decision-making regarding lifestyle choices, thus enabling them to adopt habits that promote an active and healthy lifestyle.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, physical education is an integral part of the education system because it provides students with skills and knowledge needed for their overall health and wellness. It reinforces the importance of physical activity, social skills, intellectual, psychological, and emotional development, leading to a more active and healthy society. Physical education offers invaluable resources for students and is essential for the holistic development of individuals.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            6. What I Can Do It is already the second or third month that the school has implemented the flexible learning approach. Instead of going physically to school, you continue learning your subjects at home, either through online classes or printed modules you receive every one or two weeks. The Department of Education would like to know how many students, like you, understand the current situation surrounding the flexible learning approach for this school year. The authorities requested the schools if the students can write an essay about this. You decided that it will be best to write a cause-and-effect essay discussing what leads to the using of a flexible learning approach.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The current situation of using flexible learning approaches has been implemented in many schools due to various reasons. This essay aims to discuss the causes and effects of using a flexible learning approach.</p><p></p><p>One of the causes of implementing a flexible learning approach is the ongoing pandemic that has affected the world. COVID-19 has made it difficult for students to physically attend classes, leading to the implementation of a flexible learning approach. Another reason is the increasing number of students in schools. With more students, schools have to come up with ways to accommodate everyone, leading to the use of a flexible learning approach.</p><p></p><p>Another cause of using a flexible learning approach is the advancement of technology. Many schools have embraced technology in their learning process. With the help of the internet, students can access their class materials and communicate with their teachers from the comfort of their homes. Technology has made it possible for schools to provide quality education to their students through a flexible learning approach.</p><p></p><p>The effect of using a flexible learning approach is that it provides students with more freedom and flexibility in their learning process. Students can learn at their own pace and can revisit lessons that they find difficult. This approach also encourages self-discipline and responsibility since students have to take charge of their learning.</p><p></p><p>Another effect of using a flexible learning approach is that it promotes inclusivity. Students who were previously unable to attend school due to distance, health issues, or other reasons can now access quality education from wherever they are. The flexible learning approach also encourages creativity among teachers since they have to come up with innovative ways to deliver their lessons.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the implementation of a flexible learning approach has been necessitated by various factors such as the pandemic, increasing number of students, and technological advancements. The approach has various effects such as promoting inclusivity, creativity, and providing students with more flexibility in their learning process. With the continued support and improvement of the approach, students can access quality education regardless of their circumstances.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Assessing your fitness may include checking your strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, and more. By checking these stats, you’ll be able to figure out where to start and where to go from there. </p><p>You know where you want to end up and how you want to look and feel when you’ve accomplished your goal, but where are you starting from? Just saying “I’m out of shape” isn’t specific enough when determining what you need to work on. You need to zone in more: Can you run one mile or five miles? Can you do one push-up or 50 push-ups? It’s important to know this so you can gradually increase the intensity of your workouts, instead of starting with a workout that’s much too difficult to handle right now. Starting with the wrong intensity can be a waste of time, or worse, a recipe for injury.</p><p>You’ll be able to use this information to tell how your fitness program is working later down the line. Let’s say you’ve done a fitness program for twelve weeks and you want to know if it worked or not. How do you know if it worked if you don’t know where you started? Some tests, like weight loss, will be easy to track because most people track that regularly. However, flexibility, body fat percentage, range of motion, and strength may not seem as obvious. By tracking all the areas of fitness from the start, you’ll know for sure if this program is working for you. Otherwise, you may be wasting your time with a program that’s leading to little or no results.</p><p>An accurate assessment will help identify the right goals, help you catch injuries before they happen, and help you determine the effectiveness of your fitness program.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Participating in PE puts children on track to make regular exercise a habit-- one that can combat obesity and reduce the likelihood of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. It also helps to maintain their brain and mental health. By making exercise ‘normal’ from an early age this becomes ingrained in them throughout their lives.  </p><p></p><p>Physical education motivates children to expand their skills, as grasping the fundamentals of one sport makes it easier to master the rules of another. Since students spend a considerable amount of time in school, it is an ideal setting to empower them to take responsibility for their health. Often a secondary benefit of physical education is that children become more aware of what they are putting in their bodies. They realise the importance of a healthy, balanced diet and that sugary snacks are not the best way to gain energy for their sport.  They will often want to find out more about their bodies and this again teaches them to care for themselves and others.</p><p></p><p>Studies also suggest that students who are less active are more likely to experience sleep disorders. Regular exercise reduces stress and anxiety, contributing to healthy sleep patterns, which in turn lead to better mental health, immune system functioning, and overall well-being.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps:))</p><br />

                            28. Essay: minimum of 100 wordsIn your own opinion, what is the importance of physical education in school? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>Physical Education (PE) develops students’ competence and confidence to take part in a range of physical activities that become a central part of their lives, both in and out of school.
</p><p>
</p><p>A high-quality PE curriculum enables all students to enjoy and succeed in many kinds of physical activity. They develop a wide range of skills and the ability to use tactics, strategies and compositional ideas to perform successfully. When they are performing, they think about what they are doing, they analyse the situation and make decisions. They also reflect on their own and others’ performances and find ways to improve upon them. As a result, they develop the confidence to take part in different physical activities and learn about the value of healthy, active lifestyles.
</p><p>
</p><p>Discovering what they like to do, what their aptitudes are at school, and how and where to get involved in physical activity helps them make informed choices about lifelong physical activity. PE helps students develop personally and socially. They work as individuals, in groups and in teams, developing concepts of fairness and of personal and social responsibility. They take on different roles and responsibilities, including leadership, coaching and officiating. Through the range of experiences that PE offers, they learn how to be effective in competitive, creative and challenging situations.</p><p></p><br />
