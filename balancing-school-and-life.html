Students have the chance to make new friends, join clubs, and gain more independence. There are usually activities, such as dances and school trips. On the downside, not all students adjust quickly to their new situation. They may have trouble making friends. Some will struggle with the greater workload and difficulty of the assignments. Middle school often brings increased social pressures, like choosing the right clothes. For may students, middle school is a balance between the good and the bad.

Getting lost and taking the wrong way isn't a calamity; we simply need to keep going — it's all part of the journey. Keep it simple, and don't forget to be kind to yourself.</p><p></p><p>You don't have to give up your responsibilities as a child to be a student. All you have to do is make a good time plan and stick to it. You don't have to undertake all of the duties, but you do have to let everyone in your house know that you have another obligation and priority to deal with, and that they should take it into account and make their own movement. Your role as a good citizen does not have to constantly be to be a good samaritan; you just have to do whatever happened to involve you and your family.</p><p></p><p>That's when balance is made. You have to start with yourself and your family and not anyone else. You can't make a balance life if you will mind others than yourself.</p><br />
