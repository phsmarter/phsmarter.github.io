In 1900, English became the official medium of instruction in Philippine schools. The period 1910 to 1935 is generally called the Period of Apprenticeship. The Filipino writers of this time were imitating American and English writers. One major reason for this is that these writers were college students and young graduates whose literary education had been largely confined to American and English authors. Thus, the University of the Philippines, which was founded in 1908, became the center of the literary effort.​</a>

                            14. How did the American regime influence the development of Philippine literature, and give one author and his work that emerged during this period that continues to influence and inspire contemporary Filipino writers today?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The American regime had a significant impact on the development of Philippine literature. When the Americans colonized the Philippines in 1898, they brought with them their language, culture, and educational system. This led to the spread of English language and literature, which gradually replaced Spanish as the dominant literary medium. The American regime also brought new literary forms and genres such as the short story, the novel, and free verse poetry, which were widely adopted by Filipino writers.</p><p></p><p>One author and his work that emerged during this period and continue to influence and inspire contemporary Filipino writers today is Jose Garcia Villa and his book of poetry titled "Have Come, Am Here" (1942). Villa is considered as one of the most influential Filipino writers of the 20th century and is known for his innovative use of language and form in poetry.</p><p></p><p>"Have Come, Am Here" is a collection of Villa's free verse poems that explore themes of love, death, and the human condition. The book is notable for its use of imagistic language, unconventional syntax, and vivid imagery. Villa's poems often contain striking and surprising images that challenge the reader's perceptions of reality.</p><p></p><p>Villa's work has had a profound influence on contemporary Filipino writers, particularly those writing in English. His innovative use of language and form has inspired many Filipino poets to experiment with their own writing and to push the boundaries of what is considered traditional or conventional in poetry. Villa's legacy has also paved the way for the emergence of contemporary Filipino poets who continue to explore new possibilities in language and form, and to use poetry as a means of expressing their unique experiences and perspectives as Filipinos</p><br />
