                                            B. Read carefully the following essay about books and television as vehicles of knowledge. Fill up the table on the next page by writing down the similarities and differences between books and television. Books are often called the vehicles of knowledge." This is because they carry much information. Television does the same thing. Most students prefer watching television to reading a book. No one can deny that books and television are both vehicles of knowledge. They both convey information for people to digest or learn and understand. The knowledge people gain from both books and television depends upon the kind of books they read and the kind of television programs they watch.Obviously, books and television have some differences. When reading a book, we usually imagine the thoughts or ideas presented in it. In watching television, we do not need to imagine because the thought or idea is clearly shown. That is why studies show that learning is more effective with the use of television than with books.Whatever the case may be, it is important that both books and television be used for effective learning. Options should not be limited to either books or television alone.​</a>

                            5. Write a short essay about what is the best reading style or technique for reading great books and the best that suits you.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reading is a personal and subjective activity, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reading great books. However, there are certain reading styles and techniques that can enhance your reading experience and help you get the most out of the books you read.</p><p>One of the most effective reading techniques is active reading. This involves engaging with the text actively by asking questions, making connections, and drawing conclusions. Active reading encourages critical thinking and helps you retain information more effectively. To read actively, it is important to take notes, underline or highlight important passages, and ask yourself questions about the text as you read.</p><p>Another effective reading technique is slow reading. Slow reading involves taking your time with the text and reading it carefully and attentively. This technique is particularly useful for complex or dense texts that require a deeper understanding. Slow reading allows you to absorb the material more thoroughly and to notice details and nuances that might be missed in a faster read.</p><p>Furthermore, there is no one best reading style, and the best technique is the one that suits you the most. For example, some people prefer to read in silence, while others like to read with background noise. Some prefer to read in short bursts, while others like to read for long stretches at a time. Experiment with different styles and techniques to find what works best for you.</p><p>Personally, I find a combination of active reading and slow reading to be the most effective for me. I like to take notes, underline passages, and ask questions as I read, while also taking my time with the text to ensure I fully understand it. I also like to read in silence to minimize distractions and allow myself to focus on the material.</p><p>In conclusion, the best reading style or technique for reading great books varies from person to person. However, active reading and slow reading are two effective techniques that can enhance your reading experience and help you get the most out of the books you read. Experiment with different styles and techniques to find what works best for you and stick with it.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Fill up the table on the next page by writing down the similarities and differences between books and television. Books are often called the vehicles of knowledge." This is because they carry much information. Television does the same thing. Most students prefer watching television to reading a book. No one can deny that books and television are both vehicles of knowledge. They both convey information for people to digest or learn and understand. The knowledge people gain from both books and television depends upon the kind of books they read and the kind of television programs they watch.Obviously, books and television have some differences. When reading a book, we usually imagine the thoughts or ideas presented in it. In watching television, we do not need to imagine because the thought or idea is clearly shown. That is why studies show that learning is more effective with the use of television than with books.Whatever the case may be, it is important that both books and television be used for effective learning. Options should not be limited to either books or television alone.​</h2><br />

We are, Plato will maintain, ultimately only fulfilled as human beings by being virtuous. Justice is thus intrinsically preferable to injustice. Indeed, Plato seems in general to underline Socrates’ view that care for the soul is our fundamental good. The only real harm is harm to the soul.</strong></p><br />

                        <p>The digital era that demands practicality and is instantaneous makes watching activities more attractive than reading. However, the majority of reading activities have not yet reached the stage of 'interest' or become a habit. Interest in watching alone is also growing. Not even a few are willing to spend a lot of quota and pay for streaming media. Watching is indeed a fun activity, this of course cannot be denied. The expertise of television workers in concocting a book with hundreds of pages into a film with a duration of 1.5 hours promises interesting entertainment without having to waste time reading it for days.</p><p><strong>Why I Prefer Watching the Movie Rather Than Reading the Books or Text</strong></p><p>I prefer watching the movie rather than reading books or texts because <strong>watching is more fun and practical</strong>. I do not have to struggle to read word by word or find the meaning of some words that I do not know. By watching, I can get an interesting visual and sound depiction, a clear background of the pl4ce and atmosphere, knowing the characters in the movie which are certainly more clearly described than in reading, and characters that are easier to describe according to the expressions and tone of voice that are clearly depicted in the movie by the actors. While reading I can only imagine without being able to know the actual atmosphere that happened. I can only create the atmosphere inside according to what I want, of course it is not a pleasant thing.</p><p>Watching is also <strong>useful in reducing stress</strong>. By watching, I can easily get into the story, get carried away in the story, feel the atmosphere in the story and can make me forget about problems or things in the real world that sometimes stress me out. In contrast to reading, reading makes me unable to enjoy or understand the storyline in a book or text, sometimes I really have to prepare a certain time for reading so that I focus on understanding the content of the story. Meanwhile, watching movies doesn't really need a special time because I can watch it anytime because just listening to the sound allows me to easily understand the story I am watching. Therefore, in my opinion watching movies is more fun than reading books or texts.</p><p>Find more about the essay that expl4ins why you prefer watching the movie rather than reading the book here: https://brainly.ph/question/21610534</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Because the situations in movies seem realistic, I like to watch them rather than read books. In light of the fact that not everyone has an active imagination capable of visualizing every scene in a novel, viewing movies can be more convenient since I can hear the emotions in their voices and see the expressions that not everyone has the ability to envision</p><p></p><p>While I believe that books are more elegantly written than movies, I believe that when I am watching a movie, I feel as though I am the main character.</p><p></p><p>Advantages: Seeing the characters come to life and giving your imagination a sense of reality is one of the most appealing aspects of a book being transformed into a film. When reading a book, many individuals struggle to conceive and picture the characters or circumstances, but a film makes it much easier.</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages: Books are always more detailed, and many people find it easier to relate to a character's feelings in a book than in a fast-paced film. Despite the fact that the picture is well-made in its own right, when compared to the book, many details are lacking.</p><br />

                            14. make an argumentative essay about Reading e-books is better than the paper ones ​</h2><br />
                        <p> The emergence of e-books has revolutionized the way we read, and it has also sparked a debate on whether e-books are better than paper ones. While some readers argue that reading physical books is a better experience, I believe that reading e-books is superior to reading paper books for several reasons.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, e-books are more convenient than paper books. With an e-reader or tablet, you can store thousands of books in one device, allowing you to carry your entire library with you wherever you go. This convenience makes e-books ideal for travel or commuting, as you can read multiple books without having to carry a bulky backpack or suitcase.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, e-books are more affordable than paper books. The cost of printing, shipping, and distribution is eliminated when publishing an e-book, which means publishers can sell them at a lower price than paper books. This affordability is especially advantageous for students who can access e-books for a fraction of the cost of traditional textbooks.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, e-books are more environmentally friendly than paper books. The production of paper books requires cutting down trees, using energy to manufacture and transport them, and ultimately leads to the accumulation of waste. E-books eliminate all of these processes, and the only environmental impact comes from the production of the e-reader or tablet, which has a lower carbon footprint than producing paper books.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, e-books offer unique reading features that paper books cannot replicate. With an e-reader, you can customize the font size and style, adjust the brightness of the screen, and highlight or take notes on the text without marking up the physical book. E-readers also have built-in dictionaries and translation tools, making it easier for readers to understand unfamiliar words or phrases.</p><p></p><p>Finally, e-books provide access to a wider range of literature than paper books. With e-books, you can access books that may be out of print or not available in your local library or bookstore. You can also find self-published works, which provide opportunities for new and emerging authors to share their work with a global audience.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some readers may prefer the tactile experience of holding and reading a paper book, the advantages of e-books are undeniable. They offer convenience, affordability, environmental sustainability, unique reading features, and access to a wider range of literature. Therefore, I argue that reading e-books is better than reading paper ones.</p><p></p><br />

The reflective essay should have a minimum of 250 words but not exceeding 500 words.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A book that has made a huge impact on my life and falls under the fantasy genre is "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien. This epic tale of adventure and heroism has captured my imagination and inspired me in countless ways.</p><p></p><p>The world that Tolkien created in "The Lord of the Rings" is a rich and complex one, filled with fascinating characters, imaginative creatures, and breathtaking landscapes. The journey of the hobbits, Frodo and Sam, as they venture to destroy the One Ring and defeat the evil Sauron, is an epic tale of bravery and determination. Their friendship, along with the camaraderie and loyalty of the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, is a beautiful example of the power of teamwork and the bonds of friendship.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that I admire most about "The Lord of the Rings" is the way that it explores the themes of good and evil, and the choices that individuals must make in the face of those forces. The characters in the book are not simply good or evil, but rather complex individuals who must make difficult decisions and face the consequences of those choices. This complexity is what makes the story so captivating and relatable, as it mirrors the real-life struggles that we all face in our own lives.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its imaginative world and complex characters, "The Lord of the Rings" has also had a profound impact on me because of its underlying message of hope and perseverance. Despite the many challenges and obstacles that the characters face, they never give up on their quest, and they always strive to do what is right, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. This has inspired me to be more resilient in the face of challenges and to never give up on my own goals and dreams.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien is a truly impactful book that has captured my imagination and inspired me in countless ways. Its rich world, complex characters, and underlying message of hope and perseverance make it a timeless classic that will continue to be enjoyed by generations to come.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Words: 363</p><p>i hope this helps </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reading enhances your memory. Every time you read, you create a new memory of what you've read—essentially exercising your memory muscles. With each new memory, your brain forges new synapses, strengthens existing ones, and helps to keep your memory sharp.And it is also important because words - spoken and written - are the building blocks of life. ... What you become in the future will depend on the words you believe about yourself now. People, families, relationships, and even nations are built from words.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It could be a combination of watching too much television at home and doing a lot of boring worksheets in school. Once children lose interest in reading, it's hard to get them back. The motivation to read also tends to decrease as kids get older. Reading is like any other skill.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>There are a lot of reasons a student may dislike reading, but it comes down to three common themes: ability, interest, and mindset. Ability is the actual act of reading. A student who struggles with ability may be ESL, have a learning challenge, or just generally lack the skills they need to read.</p><br />
