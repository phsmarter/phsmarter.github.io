                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Spanish and American colonialization of the Philippines institutionalized the distinction among peoples in the country into mainstream Christian/Muslim and peripheral tribal/minority/ indigenous populations. Through laws, the tribal/ minority/indigenous communities were deprived of the right to their ancestral domains. Through so-called “development” activities, they were dispossessed of the land they till for their livelihood. Their marginalization, dispossession and other forms of injustices continued long after colonial rule had gone.</p><p>This article briefly traces the historical development of the legal measures that led to the oppression of the indigenous peoples in the Philippines, as well as discuss the current measures that address the problem. To prepare for the article, the author reviewed the major laws as well as the political systems from the colonial period to the present, and analyzed materials related to the training programs at the Northern Illinois University that contain critical reflections that arose from the focused group discussions among representatives of indigenous peoples from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao who attended the programs.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>indigenous people</p><p>Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples or native peoples, are ethnic groups who are the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic, usually having adopted substantial elements of a colonising culture, such as dress, religion or language. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region (sedentary) or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the inherent dignity, equality, and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. The rights of all members of indigenous populations are included in this declaration. However, Indigenous Peoples also have rights as distinct cultural groups or nations. </p><p>indigenous people</p><p>Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples or native peoples, are ethnic groups who are the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently.

However, Indigenous Peoples also have rights as distinct cultural groups or nations.</p><p>Use prewritten content</p><p>Indigenous people are people defined in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their historical ties to a particular territory, and their cultural or historical distinctiveness from other populations that are often politically dominant. The concept of indigenous people defines these groups as particularly vulnerable to exploitation, marginalization and oppression by nation states that may still be formed from the colonising populations, or by politically dominant ethnic groups. As a result</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer: A Reflection on the Lives of Indigenous People</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>It is estimated that there are approximately 370 million indigenous people living in more than 90 countries worldwide (UNESCO, 2018). Despite comprising a sizable portion of the global population, indigenous people often face discrimination and marginalized lifestyles. In many cases, indigenous people are denied basic rights and dignities, and are forcibly removed from their ancestral lands.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The situation of indigenous people is a human rights issue that deserves attention. In this essay, I will discuss the challenges faced by indigenous people, as well as some possible solutions to address these challenges.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Body</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Indigenous people often face discrimination and marginalization due to the fact that they are not members of the majority population in their respective countries. They may be seen as inferior or considered to be a burden on society. As a result, they may be denied basic rights and access to essential services.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In some cases, indigenous people are forcibly removed from their ancestral lands. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including the construction of dams or other development projects. The forced displacement of indigenous people often results in social and economic disruption, as well as cultural loss.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong> Furthermore, indigenous people are often marginalized in terms of education and employment. They may not have access to quality education, or they may be unable to find jobs that offer livable wages. This can lead to a vicious cycle of poverty and powerlessness.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>There are a number of challenges that indigenous people face. However, there are also some potential solutions to address these challenges.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One solution is to provide indigenous people with access to quality education. This can help to break the cycle of poverty and powerlessness. Additionally, it is important to create employment opportunities that offer livable wages. This will help to ensure that indigenous people are able to support themselves and their families.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another solution is to work towards the recognition of indigenous people's rights. This includes the right to self-determination, the right to their ancestral lands, and the right to cultural and linguistic expression. The recognition of these rights can help to empower indigenous people and give them a sense of control over their lives.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Indigenous people face many challenges, but there are also some potential solutions. Education and employment are two key areas that need to be addressed. Additionally, the rights of indigenous people need to be recognized. By working towards these goals, we can help to empower indigenous people and improve their quality of life. So this is my reflection about the indigenous people, I hope you understand and learn something from this essay. Good luck!!</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

(PAFID) came up with this figure by comparing the information from the National Commission on Innate People groups (NCIP) on endorsed Certificate of Genealogical Space Titles (CADTs) and existing claims from Inborn People groups (IP) communities with the remaining woodland cover information of the Timberland Administration Bureau of the Division of Environment and Common Assets (FMB-DENR). This figure proposes that administration by IP communities is instrumental in ensuring and moderating the remaining normal timberlands of the Philippines. These regions are Inborn People groups and Neighborhood Communities Moderated Regions and Regions (ICCAs).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Indigenous peoples, also known as First Nations, Aboriginal peoples, or Tribal peoples, are groups of people who are the original inhabitants of a specific region or country, and who have a distinct culture, language, and identity. Indigenous peoples often have rights that are recognized and protected by national and international laws, and these rights may differ from those of non-Indigenous peoples.</p><p></p><p>One example of a right that is specifically recognized for Indigenous peoples is the right to self-determination. This means that Indigenous peoples have the right to determine their own political status and pursue their own economic, social, and cultural development. This may include the right to control and manage their own lands, resources, and institutions.</p><p></p><p>Other examples of rights that may be recognized for Indigenous peoples include:</p><p></p>The right to maintain and revitalize their cultural practices and traditions.The right to education in their own language and in a manner that reflects their culture and traditions.The right to participate in decisions that affect their lands, resources, and rights.The right to receive fair compensation for the use of their lands or resources.These rights may not be recognized or protected for non-Indigenous peoples in the same way. It is important to note that the rights of Indigenous peoples can vary depending on the specific laws and policies of a given country or region.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            13. 250-word essay that answers the question: Why does the Philippine Government need to recognize our country's indigenous people?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The population census conducted in the Philippines in 2010 for the first time included an ethnicity variable but no official figure for Indigenous Peoples has been released yet. The country’s Indigenous population thus continues to be estimated at between 10% and 20% of the national population of 100,981,437, based on the 2015 population census.</p><p></p><p>The Indigenous groups in the northern mountains of Luzon (Cordillera) are collectively known as Igorot while the groups on the southern island of Mindanao are collectively called Lumad. There are smaller groups collectively known as Mangyan in the island of Mindoro as well as smaller, scattered groups in the Visayas islands and Luzon, including several groups of hunter-gatherers in transition.</p><p></p><p>Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines have retained much of their traditional, pre-colonial culture, social institutions and livelihood practices. They generally live in geographically isolated areas with a lack of access to basic social services and few opportunities for mainstream economic activities, education or political participation. In contrast, commercially valuable natural resources such as minerals, forests and rivers can be found primarily in their areas, making them continuously vulnerable to development aggression and land grabbing.</p><p></p><p>The Republic Act 8371, known as the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA), was promulgated in 1997. The law has been lauded for its support for respect of Indigenous Peoples’ cultural integrity, right to their lands and right to self-directed development of those lands. More substantial implementation of the law is still being sought, however, apart from there being fundamental criticism of the law itself. The Philippines voted in favour of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), but the government has not yet ratified ILO Convention 169.</p><p></p><p>The situation of Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines is worsening under the regime of President Rodrigo Duterte. Development aggression has intensified, with various mining, energy and other so-called ‘development’ projects encroaching on Indigenous territories. Human rights violations are likewise escalating, with Indigenous activists comprising most of the victims.1 In 2019, the UK-based international watchdog Global Witness has declared the Philippines as the world’s deadliest country for environmental defenders, with 30 deaths recorded in 2018.</p><p></p><p>pls help me 2, to reach 10 Brainliest thank you ☺️</p><br />

                            14. Can indigenous livelihood and technology sustain the needs of indigenous people</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For indigenous peoples, “poverty and prosperity” is intertwined with the status of their ownership, control and access to lands, territories and resources, along with the practice of their traditional occupations, sustainable resource management systems and self-governance. Their land is also the material base of their distinct identity, spirituality and culture, which are essential for their dignity and wellbeing. Thus, indigenous peoples’ perspective on being “poor” is being landless, and “prosperity” means having the security to manage and utilize their land and resources to meet their needs. The provision of basic social services such as appropriate health, education and infrastructures, and livelihood support are needed when addressing poverty in the changing condition of indigenous peoples</p><br />

They have a special relation to and use of their traditional land.</p><p></p>Explanation:<p>Indigenous peoples are inheritors and practitioners of unique cultures and ways of living.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>       The Philippine Muslims was once a dominant group in the country. They have 500 years political history, so far the longest political experience compared to other groups in the whole Philippines. Their culture is a blend of Islam and adat. Adat is the sum of both pre-Islamic culture and the philosophical interpretation of the Muslims on the teachings of Islam. It is itself the lasting contribution of the Philippine Muslims to the country’s national body politic. However, to know the Muslim history, one should understand the role of Islam in bringing about historical development. It is this Islam that actually produced heroic resistance against western colonialism. The Philippine Muslims today became known as cultural communities owing to their culture surviving foreign hegemonism to this day.</p><p></p><p>       The history of the Philippine Muslims is part of  the backbone of the historical development of the whole country. Filipino historians like Dr. Renato Constantino asserted that no Philippine history can be complete without a study of Muslim development (1990:29).</p><p></p><p>       The Philippines has two lines of historical development. The first line, which is the older, came to develop in Mindanao and Sulu. And this refers to the Muslim line of historical development . Had not this line of historical development been disturbed by western colonialism, Islam might have charted the entire destiny of the Philippine nationhood.   External factors swept into the country and brought the second line. The Hispanized Filipinos were central to the development of this second line. This is the product of the great historical experiences of the Filipino people under western rule.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest please</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The indigenous beliefs and folk religions of the indigenous people in the Philippines have played a significant role in preserving their cultural identities throughout history. Despite the influx of foreign influences, these beliefs and religions have remained deeply ingrained in the daily lives of the indigenous communities.</p><p></p><p>The indigenous people of the Philippines have a wide array of beliefs and practices that are unique to their respective ethnic groups. These include animism, ancestor worship, and belief in various spirits and deities. These beliefs are often deeply connected to their environment and the natural world, with many indigenous communities believing that everything in nature has a spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>One of the most notable examples of indigenous beliefs in the Philippines is the animistic belief system of the Lumad people, who believe in the existence of various spirits, including the spirits of the land, sea, and sky. These spirits are believed to have the power to influence the lives of the Lumad people, and are honored through offerings and rituals.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor worship is also a common practice among many indigenous communities in the Philippines, with many indigenous people believing that their ancestors can influence their lives from beyond the grave. This belief is often connected to the concept of the afterlife, with the indigenous people believing that the souls of the dead can continue to influence the lives of the living.</p><p></p><p>Despite the influence of foreign religions, such as Christianity and Islam, many indigenous communities have managed to preserve their traditional beliefs and practices. This is due in part to the remote locations of many indigenous communities, as well as their strong sense of community and cultural identity.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the indigenous beliefs and folk religions of the indigenous people in the Philippines are an integral part of their cultural heritage. Despite the influences of foreign cultures, these beliefs and religions have been kept preserved through the generations, providing the indigenous people with a sense of identity and connection to their ancestors and the natural world.</p><br />

They have made the mountains their home and survived off the land and its bounty. </p><p></p><p>The tribe openly welcomed the modern world when it reached their doorstep a few decades ago. While they accepted the new technology, they also kept their traditional way of life intact. Their language was protected, and they welcomed outsiders and visitors with open arms.</p><p></p><p>The mountain people revere nature and all that it provides – from the fruits and vegetables they grow, to the wildlife that share their home. They live in harmony with nature and respect the laws of their ancestors. </p><p></p><p>One day, a group of environmental activists visited the tribe to learn more about their way of life. The tribe was surprised to see outsiders interested in their ways, but they willingly shared their stories and customs. The activists were inspired by what they heard and promised to help protect the tribe and their land. </p><p></p><p>Inspired by this act of kindness, the mountain people decided to give back too.

Many have been displaced from their ancestral lands due to large-scale development projects, mining operations, and other forms of resource extraction. This displacement has led to the loss of traditional knowledge and practices, as well as social and economic marginalization.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, many indigenous communities in the Philippines continue to fight for their rights and their way of life. They have organized themselves into advocacy groups and have sought legal recognition of their rights to their ancestral lands and resources. They have also worked to preserve their cultural heritage through traditional practices, music, dance, and storytelling.</p><p></p><p>Today, there is a growing recognition of the importance of protecting the rights and cultural heritage of indigenous people in the Philippines.
