                            2. Essay on Microbes in the universe.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Every week brings news of superbugs, rare parasites, and flesh-eating bacteria. As two microbiologists working at a medical school, we know full well that those threats are real and can’t be dismissed. But the bad news unfortunately elbows aside the untold stories of the microbes that pioneered life on Earth and the diverse microbes that continue to support our lives.</p><p></p><p>For the past three years, we have been photographing traces of the earliest microbes as well as the output of those at work today. We’ve captured thousands of images of microbes in far-flung landscapes and fantastic micro-scales. What we saw compelled us to share the beauty of the microbial world in a book of photographic essays, “Life at the Edge of Sight.” It sends a different message about microbes than what often appears in the headlines: The most fundamental realities of the microbial world are remarkably positive. Here are a few of these positive realities and even parallels to be drawn between humans and microbes.</p><p></p><p>Microbes first</p><p>Around 4 billion years ago, primordial cells began to form in a hot, chemical-rich broth. One credible storyline starts inside erupting geysers in a thermal region on land, similar to present-day Yellowstone National Park. Minerals on geyser walls catalyzed the formation of simple types of fat molecules and spewed them into nearby pools. As the molecules collected and interacted, these pools became hatcheries of microscopic spheres called vesicles. Meanwhile, RNA molecules arose through other chemical reactions and began to self-replicate inside vesicles. Heat fluctuations and turbulence in the environment eventually kick-started a primitive cellular life cycle and these proto-cells began to divide and reproduce. Those were the first microbes; that was the first life on Earth.</p><p></p><p>Invisible chefs</p><p>Though we are inexorably linked to the first invisible organisms in an unbroken evolutionary chain, our ancestors had no clue about microbes even as they were helping them. Here’s the story of the making of kombucha, a drink that has become wildly popular.</p><p></p><p>It begins with someone who once prepared a jug of sweet tea and left it to sit undisturbed. (Some say this happened in ancient China; others say it happened more recently in Russia.) After rediscovering the tea a few weeks later, the forgetful one noticed a thick white layer floating atop the liquid. Feeling adventurous, he or she poured the tea into a cup, leaving the white layer behind, and took a sip. “Mmm!” the experimenter exclaimed. It was a tangy and effervescent.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            5. State the Vision of the Isabela State University. essay please​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Isabela State University-Ilagan Campus was one of the three (3) original campuses merged to become the first state university in Region II, the others were Cabagan Campus and Echague Campus. Through the Presidential Decree 1434 signed on June 10,1978, the Isabela State University was created. Today there are eleven campuses of the university system strategically located in the different municipalities of Isabela.</p><p></p><p>Ilagan Campus is located some 400 kilometers north of Manila, in Barangay Calamagui 2nd, City of Ilagan, Isabela. Its rolling area of 2.11 hectares is located along Maharlika Highway which make it accessible to land transport.</p><p></p><p>The campus caters mostly to sons and daughters of Isabelinos who are economically poor and marginalized. It provides various scholarship grants to deserving students. Other scholarship grants are also provided by various civic spirited and benevolent sponsors in the province.</p><p></p><p>Today, ISU-Ilagan Campus has a student population of more than 3,700 students enrolled this school year 2011-2012. It has 120 faculty members of various disciplines and about 40 non-teaching staff. Through the years, Ilagan campus has produced engineers, teachers, nurses, midwives, IT experts and industrial technologists’ .It has consistently achieved remarkable school performance nationwide and produced topnotchers in the Nursing, Civil and Electrical Engineering Licensure Examinations, attracting the bright students from local high schools to enroll in the program.</p><p></p><p>Most of the programs offered in the campus have already undergone preliminary survey and accredited Level I by the AACCUP. The campus has been working hard towards providing excellent education to its clientele through the four thrusts of the University, namely: instruction, research, extension and production. It is commissioned to produce globally competitive graduates ready to meet the challenges of the times.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Vision</p><p></p><p>"The Isabela State University as a leading, vibrant, comprehensive and research university in the country and the ASEAN region."</p><p></p><p>The Isabela State University is one of the top state universities in the country having been named as one of the 19 leading universities by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). It has also been identified as one of the 12 Level IV universities in the country by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). All these speak a lot about the stature of the University in so far as some national norms are concerned. However, the challenges ahead that need to be addressed appear to be increasingly becoming difficult.</p><p></p><p>The advent and ultimate entry of the Philippines into the ASEAN 2015, and its impact in terms of the type, level, competition, as well as the supply and demand for labor and skills in an open market has tremendous implications not only for state college and universities, but also for private academic institutions in the region. The state universities and colleges in the country – the ISU in particular, must brace for the challenges of the ASEAN one open economy. It must start its program to respond to international norms and take leadership to make sure that Filipinos become competitive. It is a formidable challenge and ISU must keep focus and remain steadfast in its vision to be one among the leading comprehensive research universities in the ASEAN region.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Mission</p><p></p><p>"The Isabela State University is committed to develop highly trained and globally competent professionals; generate innovative and cutting-edge knowledge and technologies for people empowerment and sustainable development; engage in viable resource generation programs; and maintain and enhance stronger partnerships under good governance to advance the interests of national and international communities."</p><p></p><p>Established in 1978, the University has developed into a premiere comprehensive state university in the country in a span of 34 years. In the medium term until 2018, the University commits to break into international stature through the development of globally competitive graduates in the undergraduate and post graduate education. In so doing, it commits to create an environment that nurtures academic freedom for a diverse studentry and professionals to unleash their best creative and innovative initiatives in leading and cutting-edge researches.</p><p></p><p>It commits to consolidate, generate, and efficiently manage its resources to support the foregoing initiatives as well as their utilization for the benefit and development of our students, our people and supply the much needed knowledge, skills, and technologies sought for national development and by international communities.</p><p></p><p>In addition, it commits to develop and maintain the support of a credible, highly trained, and competitive faculty and staff support to drive and sustain this mission and contribute significantly to the development of our national human capital</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Universe", being that the Universe is all of space-time and everything that exists therein, including all planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, the smallest subatomic particles, and all known matter and energy.</p><p></p><p>It goes on to talk about the observable universe which is approximately 46 Billion light-years in radius. While this data is all well and good, here to me is where some of our thinking about the Universe breaks somewhat with logic. The common scientifically published 'age of the universe' is 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years old, which goes on to say that Universal Expansion is the reasoning behind this dating when correlated with the radius of the known Universe.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I think the Universe is *much* older than that, possibly countless trillions of years old, and my reasoning behind that is pretty simple really: We can detect a radius of approx. 46G-ly, but how long have we had instruments trained on the region of space that we determine to be the edge of this Universe? When we look really deep into the void, our instruments detect the light of objects already in existence, not objects forming, but already existing. If the Universe were only 13-to-15 billion years old as some have suggested, then logic would dictate that the farthest away objects observable due to the speed of photonic motion (light-speed) would have the appearance of an accretion process or something similarly along those lines which would be in line with the (so called) laws of physics at the cosmic scale. However, I've never read a single article out of the cosmology community that made any such claims. Of course, with something so distant, could we even hope to get the level of detail to discern what objects at that distance are doing?</p><p></p><p>What is the Universe? If considered along the lines of quantum mechanics, then evidence shows the fundamental makeup of the Universe to be arrangements of energies that transcend the observable reality in which we find ourselves. One of the best examples of this is the most simple molecule we know... hydrogen. Hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 electron. As the electron orbits the proton, it disappears rather than making a full orbit, but yet when the electron reappears, it's perfectly in line with the orbital path that it left before disappearing. The big question here is where does this electron go?</p><p></p><p>I tend to put that information in the same category as "Where did the void come from in which we find our Universe?". A great mystery with no foreseeable answer in sight, at least not at our current level of technological progression. Maybe we'll understand these things better by the time we become a Type-2 or Type-3 civilization, but so long as we are a Type-0 civilization, these answers will remain out of reach.</p><br />

My argument is based on these major issues: the people involved and their experiences, a variety of groups' opinions, the political background, issues of cost, and comparisons. After taking into account these arguments, the reader should have a full understanding of why we should adopt the universal healthcare system in America.             The healthcare system in the United States is unlike any other because the government has never provided universal coverage for everyone in the country. The World Health Organization reported that "among the world's 29 industrialized nations, only the US does not have a form of universal healthcare coverage for its citizens"(qtd. in Scott 53: 32). We currently have a system called "managed care" where some citizens have private insurers and can choose which physician they wish to go to. The problem with this system is that not enough people in the country can afford insurance. The majority of the people affected by this issue are anyone falling in or above the lower middle class population. Americans in the lower middle class make just enough money to live, but unfortunately cannot afford basic healthcare. Citizens with insurance are affected because they must pay overpriced hospital fees to compensate for the uninsured. CQ researcher revealed that hospitals run at about 114 percent of costs – so the excess can subsidize the uninsured.</p><br />

Using a series of lenses to explore physical existence not readily visible to the naked eye — albeit at vastly different scales — has provided inspiration to generations of budding researchers and science enthusiasts over the centuries. Take a straw poll of those working around you and it is likely that the majority of your colleagues will have messed around with a microscope or telescope in their youth; indeed, a poll of the Nature Microbiology editorial office gave a unanimous positive outcome. Some individuals take pursuit of the intersection between microbiology and space science to an entirely different level, as revealed in an illuminating interview in this month's issue with Kate Rubins, a virologist and NASA astronaut who recently became the first person to sequence DNA in space (see ‘A microbiologist's guide to the galaxy’1).</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In recent years, there has been a growing movement to allow transwomen to compete in beauty pageants, including Miss Universe. This is a hotly debated issue, with some arguing that it would be unfair to allow transwomen to compete against cisgender women, while others believe that it is a matter of inclusivity and equality. In my opinion, transwomen should be allowed to compete in Miss Universe, as it would promote diversity, break down stereotypes, and support the trans community.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, allowing transwomen to compete in Miss Universe would promote diversity. The beauty industry has historically been criticized for promoting a narrow and unrealistic standard of beauty, which can have negative effects on people's self-esteem and body image. Allowing transwomen to participate in these competitions would expand the definition of beauty and promote a more inclusive and accepting view of femininity. It would show that beauty comes in all shapes, sizes, and genders, and that everyone deserves to be celebrated for who they are.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, allowing transwomen to compete in Miss Universe would help to break down stereotypes about the trans community. Transgender people are often subjected to discrimination and violence, and are often stereotyped as being abnormal or deviant. Allowing transwomen to compete in beauty pageants would show that they are no different from cisgender women, and that they have just as much right to express their femininity and be celebrated for their beauty. It would challenge traditional gender roles and promote a more nuanced and accepting view of gender identity.</p><p></p><p>Finally, allowing transwomen to compete in Miss Universe would be an important show of support for the trans community. Transgender people face significant challenges when it comes to accessing healthcare, employment, and social support. Allowing transwomen to compete in beauty pageants would send a message that they are valued members of society, and that their contributions and achievements are recognized and celebrated. It would provide a platform for transwomen to showcase their talents and accomplishments, and inspire other members of the trans community to pursue their dreams.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, allowing transwomen to compete in Miss Universe is a matter of inclusivity, diversity, and equality. It would promote a more nuanced and accepting view of femininity, break down stereotypes about the trans community, and provide a platform for transwomen to showcase their talents and accomplishments. As a society, we should embrace and celebrate diversity in all its forms, and recognize the inherent beauty and worth of all people, regardless of their gender identity.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The world has come a long way in terms of inclusivity and acceptance, yet we still have a long way to go. One of the debates that has been going on for a long time is whether transwomen should be allowed to participate in Miss Universe. There are people who argue that transwomen should not be allowed to participate, but there are many reasons why they should be allowed.</p><p></p><p>The first reason why transwomen should be allowed to participate in Miss Universe is that they are women. Transwomen are women who have gone through a lot of hardship to identify as who they truly are. They have undergone hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries to align their bodies with their gender identity. Therefore, they should be treated and acknowledged as the women they are.</p><p></p><p>The second reason is that Miss Universe is a beauty pageant that represents women from all over the world. It is a platform that showcases the beauty, intellect, and talent of women. By excluding transwomen from the competition, we are telling them that their beauty and talent are not valid, and we are denying them the opportunity to showcase their true selves.</p><p></p><p>The third reason is that allowing transwomen to participate in Miss Universe would send a strong message of acceptance and inclusivity. It would show that we are moving towards a more tolerant and diverse world, where everyone is accepted regardless of their gender identity. It would also provide a platform for transwomen to speak out about their experiences and raise awareness about the issues that affect them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Miss Universe has already taken steps towards inclusivity by allowing transgender women to participate in its competitions in recent years. In 2012, Miss Universe Canada allowed Jenna Talackova, a transgender woman, to compete, and in 2018, Angela Ponce became the first transgender woman to compete in Miss Universe Spain. These instances have shown that transwomen can compete and succeed in these competitions without any negative impact on the pageant's integrity.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, transwomen should be allowed to participate in Miss Universe. They are women who have gone through a lot to identify as who they truly are, and they should be treated and acknowledged as such. Allowing transwomen to compete would send a strong message of acceptance and inclusivity, and it would provide them with a platform to showcase their beauty, talent, and intellect. It is time to move towards a more tolerant and diverse world, and allowing transwomen to participate in Miss Universe would be a step in the right direction.</p><p></p><br />

They are part of our universe. The universe is a huge space which contains everything that exists. The celestial bodies that we see are just a small fraction of the bodies that exist in the universe.

One of the reasons why we do not see more of them is that they are very, very far away.To measure the large distances in the universe, scientists use a unit of length called the light year. A light year is the distance travelled by light in one year. Light travels 9.46 trillion km in a year (one trillion is 1 followed by 12 zeroes).One light year represents this huge distance. Proxima Centauri, the star closest to our solar system, is 4.2 light years from us. This means that light from this star takes 4.2 years to reach us. In this article, we shall learn a bit about stars and our solar system. But before that, let us see how the universe was formed.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.

In this article, we shall learn a bit about stars and our solar system. But before that, let us see how the universe was formed.Scientists believe that the universe was born after a massive explosion called the ‘big bang’. A long time after the big bang, stars like our sun were formed. At that time, clouds of hot gases and particles revolved around the sun. Over time, many particles got stuck together to form large bodies. These bodies pulled in smaller objects near them by gravitational force. This made them larger still. These bodies finally became the planets.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>:&gt;</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan lang isulat mo it's only a short explaination but hope it helps thank you!</p><br />
