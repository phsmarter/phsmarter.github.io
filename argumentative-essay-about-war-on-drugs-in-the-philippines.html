                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong>:</p><p>As students, we are accustomed to receiving homework as part of our academic life. However, the debate over the effectiveness of homework has been ongoing for years, with some advocating for the abolishment of homework altogether. While the idea of no homework policy may sound attractive to students, it is not a feasible solution to improve the educational system. In fact, homework is an essential component of learning, and it helps students develop crucial skills that they will need in the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>Argument 1: Homework Helps Students Learn and Retain Information</strong></p><p></p><p>One of the primary reasons why homework is essential is that it reinforces what students have learned in the classroom. By completing homework assignments, students are more likely to remember the information they have learned and retain it for a more extended period. Moreover, homework provides an opportunity for students to apply what they have learned in the classroom to real-life situations. This helps them develop a better understanding of the subject matter, and it enables them to see the practical applications of the knowledge they have gained.</p><p></p><p><strong>Argument 2: Homework Develops Key Skills</strong></p><p></p><p>Homework also helps students develop key skills that are essential for success in both their academic and personal lives. By completing homework assignments, students learn how to manage their time effectively, prioritize tasks, and meet deadlines. These are skills that will serve them well in college and beyond, as well as in their careers. Additionally, homework encourages students to think critically and independently, as they must solve problems on their own without the help of a teacher.</p><p></p><p><strong>Argument 3: Homework Prepares Students for the Future</strong></p><p></p><p>Homework is not just about learning subject matter; it is also about preparing students for the future. In college and the workforce, students will be required to complete assignments independently and manage their time effectively. Homework is an excellent way to develop these skills, and it provides students with a taste of what they can expect in the future. Additionally, homework teaches students responsibility and accountability, as they are expected to complete assignments on time and to the best of their abilities.</p><p></p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p></p><p>While it may be tempting to do away with homework altogether, this is not a practical or effective solution. Homework is a critical component of learning, and it provides numerous benefits to students. It reinforces classroom learning, helps students develop key skills, and prepares them for the future. Rather than abolishing homework, we should focus on improving the quality of homework assignments and finding ways to make them more engaging and relevant to students' lives. Homework should be seen as an opportunity for students to continue their learning outside of the classroom, and as a way to develop essential skills that will serve them well in the future</p><br />

                        The War on Drugs is an effort in the United States since the 1970s to combat illegal drug use by greatly increasing penalties, enforcement, and incarceration for drug offenders.

Not only you destroyed yourself, but also the way other people perceive see. Though drugs are for medicinal purposes, some users are abusing that and they get addicted to such drug, most commonly, to forget their problems.

Some countries legalized the use of marijuana because of its medicinal purposes. Commonly used to cure cancer as an alternative medicine if they can't afford chemotherapy. However, it is still not enough because there are still cancer cells that might be lurking around and anytime, the cancer cells would duplicate. However, for those who use it excessively, they are the drug addicts. They use it to simply forget their problems. Though little did they know, they are slowly crumbling their own sanity with that and their body got used to have drugs in it that is why if not taken regularly, they would go berserk, acting violently, aggressive and some are having illusions, tendency for them not to recognize what is right or wrong or just kills whoever gets in their way. It was a game of slaughter or be slaughtered. </p><p></p><br />

                        The so-called “War on Drugs,” as declared by the Nixon administration in the signing of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, marked the beginning of the current era of mandatory minimum sentencing, racism, privatized prisons, and a powerful constituency that profits as a result of the prohibition of drugs. Psychoactive substances have been apart of the human experience as long as humans have walked the earth. There is little hope that drug production will ever be curtailed, so long as there is a demand; a demand that has remained steady even though it has been forty years since the beginning of said war. As Judge James P. Gray from the Superior Court of Orange County has so plainly put it: “Where did this policy …show more contentWar on drugs is a thing in the philippines where the incident gone bigger and worse when Mister President Rodrigo Duterte starting getting full control for the safety of the Philippines.

May mga batas na ipinatupad pero mismong batas na yata ang sumusuko dahil sa dami ng gumagamit ng droga. Dahil sa hirap ng buhay, ginagawang pantawid gutom ng mga kabataan sa lansangan ang droga. Hindi sapat ang batas lang ang magpapatigil sa mga kabataang lulong na lulong sa droga. Kailangang matutununan ng mga kabataang ito na mali ang kanilang ginagawa. Sarili nila ang may kontrol pero kung disiplina at sarili nila ang iisipin, ang kagustuhan nilang umunlad and kanilang buhay dapat sila na mismo ang umiwas. <br />

                        An unsafe medications culture has saturated all levels of Philippine society. Likewise, attributable to its vital area in the Pacific, the Manila universal air terminal has turned out to be perceived as a global trade for disallowed drugs and the nation has turned into a crowding community for medicate donkeys. In view of my experience helping Filipinos conveying restricted medications at Pakistani airplane terminals, I wailed over in the article the absence of global participation, particularly in the trading of insight data coordinated at the fear of the medication syndicates that send these ladies on their dangerous errands. <br />In the same way as other Filipinos, I was cheery about President Duterte's pursuing a persistent war against unlawful medications as he guaranteed amid his race battle. Yet, sans Digong's bright dialect and claims of human rights mishandle by specific parts here and abroad, the new organization's war on medications may have gotten away worldwide consideration. While unlawful medications have turned out to be a grave risk to the solidness and development of creating nations, there have been eminent patterns in the West in the most recent decade in decriminalizing misuse of perilous medications. Heroin has for quite some time been legitimate in Italy. As of late, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Canada have assigned stops and focuses where medications might be dispersed and utilized without gambling capture. <br />VP Robredo has alluded to Portugal's endeavors to regard tranquilize manhandle completely as a wellbeing issue. Certain states in the United States have lifted confinements in fluctuating degrees on the deal and utilization of maryjane or cannabis. Like the cigarette some time recently, the youthful wherever are baited to illicit medications by their relationship with amusement individuals notwithstanding the last's withering a direct result of overdose. <br />The historical backdrop of the transaction of global arrangements on opiates control from its initial one in the 1930s demonstrates the worldwide group having (no less than) two personalities about opiates control. Nations known for their opium and coca manors stressed how opiates control would influence their economies! Created nations would not have opiates control influence the walk of drug and science. Regardless of whether minor individual utilize ought to be controlled or not involves persistently seething open deliberation. Indeed, even as the present arrangements perceive opiates control as important to the prosperity of the global group, implementation of the settlement is left totally to the individual state gathering and its national laws. The offices made by these arrangements, for example, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime have in no way, shape or form supranational forces. Their significance lies altogether on their detailing patterns in the utilization of opiates and the posting and delisting of controlled medications. I question if the whereabouts, developments, and operations of universal medication rulers and their diverse lieutenants crosswise over outskirts are even in the UNODC radar. <br />Duterte's war on drugs has been reprimanded and envisioned as a war on poor people. An American correspondent won a Pulitzer prize leading on photographs taken by Filipino picture takers of the demise of medication pushers or clients or both in the ghettos of Metro Manila and the congestion of rumpled surrenderees and prisoners in a Quezon City detainment focus. The alert about the selling and manhandle of hazardous medications has been to a great extent and accurately because of their spreading to even the most impeded segments of society, bleakly putting into question the eventual fate of almost 50% of the Philippine populace and their posterity. <br />Medication masters and their cronies have underhandedly discovered methods for making even the urban and country poor take to drugs that they regularly can't bear. The medication of decision in the Philippines is methamphetamine, referred to locally as shabu, which is less expensive than opium, and its subsidiaries, and which can be promoted in little bundles or debased to make it much less expensive. It is foreign made from China and Korea or produced locally. <br />Duterte's war on drugs has had a few deformities. A key one exudes from the very reason the general population voted in favor of him: his guarantee of quick, powerful activity to tackle the medications issue saw to be at the base of rising culpability. It is clear at this point the due date Duterte set for himself for unraveling this national scourge was unreasonable. <br />The Duterte organization did not permit itself an interruption to ponder the size of a national crusade. It appears to have been accepted that the Philippines is only a bigger Davao.<br />

Despite these arguments, I firmly believe that legalizing drugs would be a dangerous path to follow.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph 1:</p><p>One of the main reasons why drugs should not be legalized is that it would lead to increased drug use and addiction. Studies have shown that when drugs are legalized, their use increases significantly, and this can have serious consequences for individuals and society as a whole. For example, drug use can lead to impaired judgement, poor decision making, and a host of other negative outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph 2:</p><p>Another reason why drugs should not be legalized is that it would lead to increased crime. While supporters of drug legalization argue that it would reduce crime rates, the reality is that legalizing drugs would only lead to more drug-related crimes, as addicts would still need to fund their addiction, and drug gangs would still exist to profit from the sale of drugs.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph 3:</p><p>Finally, the legalization of drugs would have a negative impact on public health. Legalizing drugs would send a message to society that drug use is acceptable, and this could lead to more people using drugs and suffering the negative health consequences that come with drug use. Moreover, the healthcare system would be burdened with the costs of treating drug-related illnesses and injuries.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, while the debate over drug legalization is complex, I believe that legalizing drugs would be a dangerous path to follow. The increased drug use, crime rates, and negative public health outcomes that would result from drug legalization far outweigh any potential benefits. Instead, we should focus on prevention, treatment, and education to reduce drug use and addiction. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it help. </p><p></p><br />

                        There have been times in history when leaders would not have questioned their subjects’ rights to consume anything. It was understood that one should care for one’s own health as best as possible and damaging things went against that but it was up to the individual. Even suicide has at various points been seen as an honorable death that violated no laws or codes. <br /><br />There are almost infinite things that can alter someone’s mood. Caffeine is a drug and can produce withdrawal symptoms if people who are addicted to it do not get an adequate dose on time. It is however an accepted drug like alcohol. A person can sip coffee in a public place without fear of being carted off to jail. Similarly, scientists have observed that consuming junk foods lights up certain pleasure centers of the brain that are quite similar to those affected by narcotics. There are also many people who have lost their lives due to complications associated with obesity, a side effect of junk food consumption. Does that make it a drug and should it be made illegal?<br /><br />Equipping police officers to fight no violent drug users takes up money and manpower hours that could otherwise have been allocated to finding arms dealers, murderers and rapists. The opportunity cost of the spot occupied by a marijuana user in jail is fair greater than it appears on the surface.<br /><br />Substance abuse has the ability to ruin lives. The abuse of any substance will do that but the problem in this case is not the substance, it is the addiction. Often people with hidden issues and emotional pain are the most vulnerable to addiction. They are trying to self medicate because they have not fully dealt with their problems. Often this is as a result of their ignorance of the resources they have available or the stigmatization of people with mental illnesses. By making them whole emotionally their desire to escape reality with chemicals will decline.<br /><br />There have been cases where the decriminalization of certain drugs has resulted in an improvement in a region’s crime rates. One has only to look at prohibition era drug cartels to see the truth in that.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p>As of recent, the war on drugs has been a very often discussed topic due to many controversial issues. Some people believe the War on Drugs has been quite successful due to the amount of drugs seized and the amount of drug kingpins arrested. I believe this to be the wrong mindset when it comes to the war on drugs. The war on drugs isn’t a winnable one so we must do all that is possible to assist those who struggle with drug addiction and decriminalize small amounts of drugs. These minor changes in the way we combat drugs will create significant change and have lasting effects.  </p><p>Some may not be too familiar with the war on drugs and the effects it has had on the society we live in.</p><p></p><p>hope it helps, its not a short one but u can get ideas here:)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>War on drugs should be stopped. It has ruined lives of hundreds of innocent people without proper justice and procedures. Yes, it lessened the crimes in the country. But do we have to get blood on our hands, to ensure safety? Was those people really the main suspects? The root of all evil? No! They are just cetizens of the Philippines. Deprived with their rights. Human rights. Killing others, makes us less human. So let's end this war, before we become monsters that we fear. </p><br />

                        War On Drugs In Philippines<p>Philippines <strong>drug war</strong>, a battle is currently raging in the Philippines. A war against drugs is being fought, not one against another nation. The Philippines' current president, Rodrigo Duterte, has started a battle against drugs. Although harsh and ruthless, the campaign has been successful. Within the first six months of his campaign, Duterte claimed he would kill 100,000 drug users and traffickers. The government of the Philippines is fighting a drug war that is leaving thousands of people dead and instilling terror throughout the nation.</p><p> </p><p>Because they attribute drug misuse to a recent outbreak of crime, including rape, theft, and robbery, the government of the Philippines is waging a <strong>war on drugs</strong>. There have been around 1,900 drug-related deaths since Duterte started his war, 600 of which are still under investigation. Given that Duterte pledged to eliminate 100,000 drug users and dealers from the streets within six months of the start of his campaign, this is nothing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, i draw the conclusion that, in addition to waging this <strong>war on drugs</strong>, there are many other things we can do to end all crime in our nation. This <strong>war on drugs</strong> has an impact on some innocent people who shouldn't be punished. In conclusion, it may be beneficial if the government's true goal is to get rid of all drug users and pushers. We could benefit from living in a secure nation free of crime.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about related topics by visiting the link below:</strong></p><p>brainly.ph/question/2162414</p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
