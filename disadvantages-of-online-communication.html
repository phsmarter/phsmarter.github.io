It is now becoming a "need" for many for easy communication, quick access to information and online entertainment. However, most schools prohibit using of these gadgets during classes because of the disadvantages it may present. This topic is now one of the most discussed between pupils, parents and school administrators. Directions: Connect the structure elements to the appropriate part of the report. The cuphar Allowing Grade 6 pupils to use cellphones during classes PROS . Emergency purposes • Easy file sharing of documents • Use of helpful educational applications like Dictionary • Distraction • Can be a tool for bullying • Screen sharing from phone to TV during reporting • Cannot concentrate during classes Playing of online games instead of participating CONS Title: Th Cellphone is It is (Definition of the issue) (Viewpoint 1: Pros) Viewpoint 2: Cons (Use transition word to contrast) (Your stand on the issue) Conclusion (Use transition word) ​</h2><br />
                        <p>Title: The Use of Cellphones in Classes</p><p></p><p>It is undeniable that cellphones have become an essential gadget for communication, access to information, and entertainment. However, most schools prohibit their use during classes due to the potential disadvantages they may bring. This topic has sparked discussions among pupils, parents, and school administrators.</p><p></p><p>Viewpoint 1: Allowing Grade 6 pupils to use cellphones during classes</p><p></p><p>PROS:</p><p>• Cellphones can be used for emergency purposes.</p><p>• Easy file sharing of documents can be done through cellphones.</p><p>• Cellphones can be used to access helpful educational applications like dictionaries.</p><p></p><p>Viewpoint 2: Cons</p><p></p><p>However, allowing cellphones during classes may also have some drawbacks, such as:</p><p>• Cellphones can be a source of distraction.</p><p>• Cellphones can be a tool for bullying.</p><p>• Screen sharing from phone to TV during reporting can disrupt the class.</p><p>• Students may not be able to concentrate during classes, as they may end up playing online games instead of participating.</p><p></p><p>Contrastingly, my stand on this issue is that cellphones should not be allowed during classes. Although it is true that they can be useful for emergency purposes and accessing educational applications, the potential distractions and negative impacts on students' concentration outweigh the benefits.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while cellphones have undoubtedly become an important part of our daily lives, it is important to consider their impact on learning and academic performance. Therefore, prohibiting the use of cellphones during classes should be strictly implemented to ensure that students are focused on learning and participating in class activities.</p><p></p><br />
