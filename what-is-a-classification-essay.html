Paragraph Development
Directions: Write TRUE if the statement is correct; otherwise, replace the underlined word/s to make the statement correct. (15 items x 2 point)
 1. Since the meaning of a word can change through time and the perception of any word can also be interpreted differently by people, it is necessary to put a denotation so that there is an experience-based definition in the essay.
 2. Connotation and extended definition are optional in writing a definition essay because people have different interpretations of words and concepts and including them would only confuse readers.
 3. The process of explaining and giving examples to clarify how the writer understand a concept is called persuasion.
 4. The main purpose of exemplification is to make even more understandable complex ideas, concepts, words, and expressions to your target readers.
 5. Enumerating facts is a technique in exemplification that relies on the individual interpretations of people on certain events, situations, ideas and concepts in supporting your point.
 6. When dealing with a Supportive Audience, pathos is the most effective appeal that you can use.
 7. Specifically in essay writing, comparison cannot be done alone nor contrast because they are complementary to each other.
 8. Personification is a technique in comparison and contrast that assigns the characteristics of non-humans to human to personify the subject.
 9. Causal Analysis can be translated into this diagram:
EFFECTS → SITUATION → CAUSES. Meaning, the author may present the causes towards the effects, or begin with the effects and proceed towards cause.
 10. The effect is what prompted something to happen.
 11. Detailing the process and giving directions are parts of explanatory mode of paragraph development.
 12. Explanation or discussion aims to make the readers understand and explain a particular statement or a theory.
 13. Classification entails categorization, which enables one to group together items according to their similarities.
 14. Exclusiveness, in a paragraph of classification, is characterized by having parallel similarities in the divisions you make in your writing.
 15. Division is a technique in classification wherein the concept or topic is broken down into its essential parts.</a>

                                            thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

 2. Connotation and extended definition are optional in writing a definition essay because people have different interpretations of words and concepts and including them would only confuse readers.
 3. The process of explaining and giving examples to clarify how the writer understand a concept is called persuasion.
 4. The main purpose of exemplification is to make even more understandable complex ideas, concepts, words, and expressions to your target readers.
 5. Enumerating facts is a technique in exemplification that relies on the individual interpretations of people on certain events, situations, ideas and concepts in supporting your point.
 6. When dealing with a Supportive Audience, pathos is the most effective appeal that you can use.
 7. Specifically in essay writing, comparison cannot be done alone nor contrast because they are complementary to each other.
 8. Personification is a technique in comparison and contrast that assigns the characteristics of non-humans to human to personify the subject.
 9. Causal Analysis can be translated into this diagram:
EFFECTS → SITUATION → CAUSES. Meaning, the author may present the causes towards the effects, or begin with the effects and proceed towards cause.
 10. The effect is what prompted something to happen.
 11. Detailing the process and giving directions are parts of explanatory mode of paragraph development.
 12. Explanation or discussion aims to make the readers understand and explain a particular statement or a theory.
 13. Classification entails categorization, which enables one to group together items according to their similarities.
 14. Exclusiveness, in a paragraph of classification, is characterized by having parallel similarities in the divisions you make in your writing.
 15. Division is a technique in classification wherein the concept or topic is broken down into its essential parts.</h2><br />

                            6. thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.
