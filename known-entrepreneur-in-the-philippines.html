We have seen this countless times during natural and man-made disasters, calamities, and situations of armed conflict. As COVID-19 continues to spread across the country, this "bayanihan" spirit is being exemplified by local artists, designers and entrepreneurs who have moved out of their comfort zones so they could give a hand to the nation's frontliners against the disease. Weaving threads of hope and resilience There has been a worldwide shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) since the outbreak of the viral disease which has taken a heavy toll on the country's health care sector. In Cagayan de Oro, a seasoned member of the Mindanao fashion industry is using her shears, measuring tape and fabric to produce Philippine flag-inspired PPEs for the nation's medical frontliners. Dubbed the Queen of Mindanaoan Fashion,' Guela Ampong, is a nurse-turned- designer with 11 years of experience in the fashion business. As a nurse herself, Ampong understands the need to protect the health of frontliners.kadugtong po ng dulo ung photo​</a>

Part IV- Making Inferences Bayanihan ni Juan: The Filipino Spirit at its Finest - PASIG CITY (April 13 2020) - The indomitable Filipino spirit is known to rise up during the most challenging of times. We have seen this countless times during natural and man-made disasters, calamities, and situations of armed conflict. As COVID-19 continues to spread across the country, this "bayanihan" spirit is being exemplified by local artists, designers and entrepreneurs who have moved out of their comfort zones so they could give a hand to the nation's frontliners against the disease. Weaving threads of hope and resilience There has been a worldwide shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) since the outbreak of the viral disease which has taken a heavy toll on the country's health care sector. In Cagayan de Oro, a seasoned member of the Mindanao fashion industry is using her shears, measuring tape and fabric to produce Philippine flag-inspired PPEs for the nation's medical frontliners. Dubbed the Queen of Mindanaoan Fashion,' Guela Ampong, is a nurse-turned- designer with 11 years of experience in the fashion business. As a nurse herself, Ampong understands the need to protect the health of frontliners.kadugtong po ng dulo ung photo​</h2><br />
