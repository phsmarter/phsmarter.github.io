                                            What’s New Activity 3: Read Me Reading Text No.1 
 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

As a result, he sent out a terrible orderThe whole area was told to put all the old people to deathThis order led to terrible times. Many people simply abandoned theirold people to die. The poor farmer who lived at the bottom of themountain was very upset He dearly loved his mother and the orderof the wicked ruler. So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut. Underthe kitchen floor was a hidden basement where food was stored Theson hid his mother in there. He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time. Finally, helifted his head and said, "Shining needs more than strength and youthI forgot the old saying. With the crown of snow, there comes wisdomImmediately, the terrible law was abolished, and the custom driftedfar to the past. Now, only the legend remains.https://read activelyleam comiteacher/reader/authoring/preview/945992/notesComprehension Check!1. Who are the characters in the story?2.

Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</a>

                                            CONCEPT NOTES ABOUT THE LITURGICAL CALENDARAdvent: First Sunday of Advent through December 24thAdvent begins the Sunday closest to the feast of St. Andrew, which is November 30th. Therefore Advent always falls sometime between November 28th and December 3rd, and lasts until the Nativity of the Lord. The season always has somewhere between 21 and 28 days.The Advent season is the time of waiting and preparing for the coming of Jesus. This refers both to the anniversary celebration of the Incarnation, as well as the second and final coming for which we are waiting and preparing. The liturgical colors of Advent are Purple and Rose, with Rose being used only on the third Sunday of Advent.Christmas: December 25th through The Feast of the Baptism of the LordThe Christmas season begins with the celebration of the birth of Jesus, Christmas day, or as a vigil on Christmas Eve. The Feast of Christmas lasts 12 days, until Epiphany. However, the time from Epiphany until the Baptism of the Lord is also included in the Christmas season. Traditionally, Epiphany had been fixed to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated on the octave of Epiphany, which was January 13th. In most countries, the Epiphany is now celebrated on the Sunday closest to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated the following Sunday. The Christmas season is a time of rejoicing in the Incarnation. The liturgical color of Christmas is white.Ordinary Time after the Baptism: Monday after the Feast of the Baptism through Shrove TuesdayAfter the celebration of the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, Ordinary Time begins. Ordinary does not mean plain. The name comes from “ordinalis” meaning "showing order, denoting an order of succession.” It is used in this sense to refer to the order of the counted weeks. That is to say, it is a season of counted weeks. Ordinary Time after the Baptism focuses on the early life and childhood of Christ, and then on His public ministry. The liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days. (For example, white is typically worn for Marian feast days, except in some Spanish countries where blue is an approved liturgical color.)Lent: Ash Wednesday through Holy SaturdayThe season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday and lasts until the final Saturday before Easter, Holy Saturday. Lent is a penitential season. It recalls the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert, and the 40 years the Israelites wandered in the desert. Lent focuses on the events leading up to Christ’s passion, and finally on the Passion itself. Lent is 40 days long. This does not include Sundays, as Sunday is always a day for rejoicing in the Resurrection. Altogether, it covers 46 calendar days, the 40 days plus the six Sundays. The liturgical colors of Lent are violet or purple, traditionally more of a red-violet color than the deep purple of Advent. Rose may also be used, where it is the custom, on Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday during Lent). On Passion Sunday (Palm Sunday) and on Good Friday (which has no Mass but a service remembering Christ’s passion) the color is red. White or violet is worn on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday (once again, there is no Mass but there are other services on Holy Saturday).Easter: Easter Vigil though PentecostThe Easter season begins with the Easter Vigil, which is celebrated after night falls on the evening before Easter Sunday. The season of Easter is a joyous, celebratory season. It begins with celebrating Christ’s resurrection and ends by celebrating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus. Christ’s ascension into Heaven is celebrated just prior to Pentecost. The Easter season last 50 days, from Easter Sunday through Pentecost. The liturgical colors of Easter are white, for most days, and red for Pentecost.Ordinary Time after Pentecost: The day after Pentecost through the final day before Advent(See the above section on Ordinary Time for the history of the term)The second period of Ordinary Time is the longest liturgical season. Ordinary Time resumes after Pentecost and runs until the final Saturday before Advent. This period of Ordinary Time focuses on Christ’s reign as King of kings, and on the age of the Church. This is the age we live in now, which is the time between the age of the Apostles and the age of Christ’s second and final coming for which we are ever preparing. The final Sunday in Ordinary Time is the Feast of Christ the King; the Saturday after this feast is the final day of Ordinary time. Again, the liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days.Pa summarize po please I begging you</a>

                                            Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

                                            Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</a>

                                            CONCEPT NOTES ABOUT THE LITURGICAL CALENDAR
Advent: First Sunday of Advent through December 24th
Advent begins the Sunday closest to the feast of St. Andrew, which is November 30th. Therefore Advent always falls sometime between November 28th and December 3rd, and lasts until the Nativity of the Lord. The season always has somewhere between 21 and 28 days.
The Advent season is the time of waiting and preparing for the coming of Jesus. This refers both to the anniversary celebration of the Incarnation, as well as the second and final coming for which we are waiting and preparing. The liturgical colors of Advent are Purple and Rose, with Rose being used only on the third Sunday of Advent.
Christmas: December 25th through The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord
The Christmas season begins with the celebration of the birth of Jesus, Christmas day, or as a vigil on Christmas Eve. The Feast of Christmas lasts 12 days, until Epiphany. However, the time from Epiphany until the Baptism of the Lord is also included in the Christmas season. Traditionally, Epiphany had been fixed to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated on the octave of Epiphany, which was January 13th. In most countries, the Epiphany is now celebrated on the Sunday closest to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated the following Sunday. The Christmas season is a time of rejoicing in the Incarnation. The liturgical color of Christmas is white.
Ordinary Time after the Baptism: Monday after the Feast of the Baptism through Shrove Tuesday
After the celebration of the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, Ordinary Time begins. Ordinary does not mean plain. The name comes from “ordinalis” meaning "showing order, denoting an order of succession.” It is used in this sense to refer to the order of the counted weeks. That is to say, it is a season of counted weeks. Ordinary Time after the Baptism focuses on the early life and childhood of Christ, and then on His public ministry. The liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days. (For example, white is typically worn for Marian feast days, except in some Spanish countries where blue is an approved liturgical color.)
Lent: Ash Wednesday through Holy Saturday
The season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday and lasts until the final Saturday before Easter, Holy Saturday. Lent is a penitential season. It recalls the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert, and the 40 years the Israelites wandered in the desert. Lent focuses on the events leading up to Christ’s passion, and finally on the Passion itself. Lent is 40 days long. This does not include Sundays, as Sunday is always a day for rejoicing in the Resurrection. Altogether, it covers 46 calendar days, the 40 days plus the six Sundays. The liturgical colors of Lent are violet or purple, traditionally more of a red-violet color than the deep purple of Advent. Rose may also be used, where it is the custom, on Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday during Lent). On Passion Sunday (Palm Sunday) and on Good Friday (which has no Mass but a service remembering Christ’s passion) the color is red. White or violet is worn on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday (once again, there is no Mass but there are other services on Holy Saturday).
Easter: Easter Vigil though Pentecost
The Easter season begins with the Easter Vigil, which is celebrated after night falls on the evening before Easter Sunday. The season of Easter is a joyous, celebratory season. It begins with celebrating Christ’s resurrection and ends by celebrating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus. Christ’s ascension into Heaven is celebrated just prior to Pentecost. The Easter season last 50 days, from Easter Sunday through Pentecost. The liturgical colors of Easter are white, for most days, and red for Pentecost.
Ordinary Time after Pentecost: The day after Pentecost through the final day before Advent
(See the above section on Ordinary Time for the history of the term)
The second period of Ordinary Time is the longest liturgical season. Ordinary Time resumes after Pentecost and runs until the final Saturday before Advent. This period of Ordinary Time focuses on Christ’s reign as King of kings, and on the age of the Church. This is the age we live in now, which is the time between the age of the Apostles and the age of Christ’s second and final coming for which we are ever preparing. The final Sunday in Ordinary Time is the Feast of Christ the King; the Saturday after this feast is the final day of Ordinary time. Again, the liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days.

It is an oscillation of the ocean-temperature system in the tropical Pacific having important consequences for weatherand climate around the globe.B. The trade winds blow towards the west across the tropical Pacific. These winds pile up warm surface water in the westPacific, so that the sea surface is about 1/2 meter higher at Indonesia than at Ecuador.C. The trade winds relax in the central and western Pacific leading to a depression of the thermocline in the easternPacific, and an elevation of the thermocline in the west.D.

REUTERS/AlexandeBRUSSELS/WASHINGTON — The United States plans to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion and is pledging $1 billion in new humanitarian aid, the Biden administration said on Thursday after a month of bombardments touched off Europe’s fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of World War Two.The announcement coincided with U.S. President Joe Biden’s meeting with European leaders in Brussels to coordinate the Western response to the crisis.More than 3.5 million people have fled since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, putting a strain on the neighboring European countries receiving them.U.S. lawmakers and advocates have urged Biden to do more to help those seeking refuge in the United States.In the first two weeks of March, seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States, internal U.S. State Department data seen by Reuters shows.Some Ukrainians have traveled to Mexico to seek U.S. asylum at the southwest border.A senior Biden official said the administration still expected many Ukrainians to choose to remain in Europe close to their home country but added the U.S. commitment to receive more people would relieve some pressure on European nations currently hosting the bulk of refugees fleeing the conflict, which Russia calls a “special military operation.”“We recognize that some number of Ukrainians who have fled may wish to come to the United States temporarily,” the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.The Biden administration said in a statement it would use “the full range of legal pathways” to bring Ukrainians to the United States, including the U.S. refugee resettlement program, which provides a path to citizenship.As part of the effort, Ukrainians may enter through existing visa avenues and through a relief program known as “humanitarian parole,” which allows people into the country on an emergency basis, the senior administration official said. The Biden administration said it will focus on Ukrainians with family members in the United States.Reuters reported details of the plans earlier this week.‘Lots of questions’Before the crisis erupted in Ukraine, Biden launched the largest U.S. resettlement effort since the Vietnam War by accepting about 80,000 Afghans – many arriving in a mass airlift operation – after U.S. troops left Afghanistan following 20 years of war.In contrast to the Afghan evacuation, however, the 100,000 Ukrainians would not necessarily be allowed into the United States all at once or even within the current fiscal year, which stretches until the end of September, the U.S. official said.About 355,000 Ukrainian immigrants live in the United States, according to data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a Washington-based think tank.Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with MPI, said that she welcomed the new U.S. commitments, but that “there are lots of questions” about how much, and how quickly, they could help.A Democrat, Biden set a goal to resettle 125,000 refugees this fiscal year, which began last October, a massive jump from former President Donald Trump, a Republican who slashed refugee levels. But amid COVID-19 delays and other challenges, only around 6,500 refugees from around the world have been admitted, far below Biden’s goal.For Ukrainians who have relatives in the United States, the administration will seek to speed up the processing of family-based visas for permanent residency.But placing Ukrainians through these legal pathways risks adding to an already ballooning backlog of hundreds of thousands of unprocessed visa applications, Gelatt said.The humanitarian parole program, another route the administration could use for Ukrainians, does not provide permanent status in the United States, meaning Ukrainians entering that way would face an uncertain future.Source: newsinfo.inquirer.net1.

                            5. What’s New Activity 3: Read Me Reading Text No.1 
 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going.

She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother.

She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart!

"Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time.

1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</h2><br />

                            10. CONCEPT NOTES ABOUT THE LITURGICAL CALENDARAdvent: First Sunday of Advent through December 24thAdvent begins the Sunday closest to the feast of St. Andrew, which is November 30th. Therefore Advent always falls sometime between November 28th and December 3rd, and lasts until the Nativity of the Lord. The season always has somewhere between 21 and 28 days.The Advent season is the time of waiting and preparing for the coming of Jesus. This refers both to the anniversary celebration of the Incarnation, as well as the second and final coming for which we are waiting and preparing. The liturgical colors of Advent are Purple and Rose, with Rose being used only on the third Sunday of Advent.Christmas: December 25th through The Feast of the Baptism of the LordThe Christmas season begins with the celebration of the birth of Jesus, Christmas day, or as a vigil on Christmas Eve. The Feast of Christmas lasts 12 days, until Epiphany. However, the time from Epiphany until the Baptism of the Lord is also included in the Christmas season. Traditionally, Epiphany had been fixed to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated on the octave of Epiphany, which was January 13th. In most countries, the Epiphany is now celebrated on the Sunday closest to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated the following Sunday. The Christmas season is a time of rejoicing in the Incarnation. The liturgical color of Christmas is white.Ordinary Time after the Baptism: Monday after the Feast of the Baptism through Shrove TuesdayAfter the celebration of the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, Ordinary Time begins. Ordinary does not mean plain. The name comes from “ordinalis” meaning "showing order, denoting an order of succession.” It is used in this sense to refer to the order of the counted weeks. That is to say, it is a season of counted weeks. Ordinary Time after the Baptism focuses on the early life and childhood of Christ, and then on His public ministry. The liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days. (For example, white is typically worn for Marian feast days, except in some Spanish countries where blue is an approved liturgical color.)Lent: Ash Wednesday through Holy SaturdayThe season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday and lasts until the final Saturday before Easter, Holy Saturday. Lent is a penitential season. It recalls the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert, and the 40 years the Israelites wandered in the desert. Lent focuses on the events leading up to Christ’s passion, and finally on the Passion itself. Lent is 40 days long. This does not include Sundays, as Sunday is always a day for rejoicing in the Resurrection. Altogether, it covers 46 calendar days, the 40 days plus the six Sundays. The liturgical colors of Lent are violet or purple, traditionally more of a red-violet color than the deep purple of Advent. Rose may also be used, where it is the custom, on Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday during Lent). On Passion Sunday (Palm Sunday) and on Good Friday (which has no Mass but a service remembering Christ’s passion) the color is red. White or violet is worn on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday (once again, there is no Mass but there are other services on Holy Saturday).Easter: Easter Vigil though PentecostThe Easter season begins with the Easter Vigil, which is celebrated after night falls on the evening before Easter Sunday. The season of Easter is a joyous, celebratory season. It begins with celebrating Christ’s resurrection and ends by celebrating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus. Christ’s ascension into Heaven is celebrated just prior to Pentecost. The Easter season last 50 days, from Easter Sunday through Pentecost. The liturgical colors of Easter are white, for most days, and red for Pentecost.Ordinary Time after Pentecost: The day after Pentecost through the final day before Advent(See the above section on Ordinary Time for the history of the term)The second period of Ordinary Time is the longest liturgical season. Ordinary Time resumes after Pentecost and runs until the final Saturday before Advent. This period of Ordinary Time focuses on Christ’s reign as King of kings, and on the age of the Church. This is the age we live in now, which is the time between the age of the Apostles and the age of Christ’s second and final coming for which we are ever preparing. The final Sunday in Ordinary Time is the Feast of Christ the King; the Saturday after this feast is the final day of Ordinary time. Again, the liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days.Pa summarize po please I begging you</h2><br />

These are times when conscious attention is given to the mysterious forces that surround and involve all living creatures in the natural and inexorable cycles of light and darkness; labour and rest; birth, growth, decay, and death.</p><p></p><p>Two interrelated cycles have had primary importance in the shaping of religious calendars. One is cosmic: the phases of the moon and the solar equinoxes and solstices. The other is the periodic succession of the seasons of nature that determines times of sowing and reaping. Both cycles speak to the mystery of birth, death, and rebirth and to human dependence upon the fecundity of life given in the natural creation.</p><p></p><p>Jewish background</p><p>The Jewish religious year, grounded in the divinely revealed Law of the Hebrew Bible, was the foundation for the church year of Christians. It is a lunar-month calendar stemming from the primitive nomadic life of the Hebrews, with its chief festival at the first full moon of spring, known later as the Passover. Grafted onto this calendar after the settlement of the Hebrew tribes in Palestine were the agricultural festivals—dependent upon “the early and later rains”—the firstfruits at Passover, the first harvest at Shavuot, or the Festival of Weeks, and the autumn harvest at Sukkoth, or the Feast of Tabernacles or Booths.</p><p></p><p>Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.</p><p>Subscribe Now</p><p>Of uncertain origin, but prior to the monarchical period (11th–6th century BCE), the Hebrews observed a seven-day week, of which the last day, or sabbath, was a holiday and day of rest. Whatever its original purpose, it became transformed into a sacral day, consecrated to Yahweh, the one God of the Hebrews, and increasingly surrounded with restrictions upon all activity other than worship. In the time of Jesus (1st century CE), “keeping holy the sabbath day” was a principal hallmark of adherence to Judaism.</p><p></p><p>The remarkable aspect of the Jewish religious year was its transformation, in successive codifications of the Torah, into a series of historical commemorations associated with God’s deed in creation and in the redemption of God’s people. At first the sabbath was related to the Exodus, the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt in the 13th century BCE (Deuteronomy 5:15) and, later, to the repose of God at the completion of the Creation (Exodus 20:8–11; Genesis 2:2–3). The three agricultural feasts became a sequence of remembrances of the Exodus from Egypt and the pilgrimage through the wilderness to the promised land (Exodus 12:1–20; Leviticus 23; Deuteronomy 16:1–17). Through these annual celebrations Jews relived the saving events of the past and anticipated the final deliverance of the people of God in the age to come. Rabban Gamaliel, a contemporary of Jesus, said, “In every generation a man must so regard himself as if he came forth himself out of Egypt…” (from Mishna, Pesaḥim 10:5).</p><p></p><p>Formation of the church year</p><p>In his earthly life, Jesus was subject to the laws of sabbath, feast, and fast prescribed in the Hebrew Bible, but his ministry and teaching pointed to a new age, the coming kingdom of God, when the Law would be fulfilled. He was, therefore, not so much concerned with outward conformity to legal regulations as he was with the spirit in which they were observed. “The sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath” (Mark 2:27). It was in the context of a celebration of the Passover feast with his disciples that he was arrested, tried, and put to death.</p><p></p><p>Early Christians believed that the new age promised by Jesus had dawned with his Resurrection, on “the first day of the week” (Matthew 28:1; Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1; John 20:1). By this event the Law was fulfilled. Now every day and time were viewed as holy for the celebration and remembrance of Jesus’ triumph over sin and death. Though many of his disciples continued to observe the special times and seasons of the Jewish Law, new converts broke with the custom because they regarded it as no longer needful or necessary. St. Paul, himself a dutiful observant of the Law, considered the keeping of holy days a matter of indifference, provided the devotion be “in honor of the Lord” (Romans 14:5–9). He warned his converts not to judge one another with regard to “festivals, new moons, or sabbaths” (Colossians 2:16).</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            11. Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

                            12. Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</h2><br />

                            13. CONCEPT NOTES ABOUT THE LITURGICAL CALENDAR
Advent: First Sunday of Advent through December 24th
Advent begins the Sunday closest to the feast of St. Andrew, which is November 30th. Therefore Advent always falls sometime between November 28th and December 3rd, and lasts until the Nativity of the Lord. The season always has somewhere between 21 and 28 days.
The Advent season is the time of waiting and preparing for the coming of Jesus. This refers both to the anniversary celebration of the Incarnation, as well as the second and final coming for which we are waiting and preparing. The liturgical colors of Advent are Purple and Rose, with Rose being used only on the third Sunday of Advent.
Christmas: December 25th through The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord
The Christmas season begins with the celebration of the birth of Jesus, Christmas day, or as a vigil on Christmas Eve. The Feast of Christmas lasts 12 days, until Epiphany. However, the time from Epiphany until the Baptism of the Lord is also included in the Christmas season. Traditionally, Epiphany had been fixed to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated on the octave of Epiphany, which was January 13th. In most countries, the Epiphany is now celebrated on the Sunday closest to January 6th, and the Baptism celebrated the following Sunday. The Christmas season is a time of rejoicing in the Incarnation. The liturgical color of Christmas is white.
Ordinary Time after the Baptism: Monday after the Feast of the Baptism through Shrove Tuesday
After the celebration of the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, Ordinary Time begins. Ordinary does not mean plain. The name comes from “ordinalis” meaning "showing order, denoting an order of succession.” It is used in this sense to refer to the order of the counted weeks. That is to say, it is a season of counted weeks. Ordinary Time after the Baptism focuses on the early life and childhood of Christ, and then on His public ministry. The liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days. (For example, white is typically worn for Marian feast days, except in some Spanish countries where blue is an approved liturgical color.)
Lent: Ash Wednesday through Holy Saturday
The season of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday and lasts until the final Saturday before Easter, Holy Saturday. Lent is a penitential season. It recalls the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert, and the 40 years the Israelites wandered in the desert. Lent focuses on the events leading up to Christ’s passion, and finally on the Passion itself. Lent is 40 days long. This does not include Sundays, as Sunday is always a day for rejoicing in the Resurrection. Altogether, it covers 46 calendar days, the 40 days plus the six Sundays. The liturgical colors of Lent are violet or purple, traditionally more of a red-violet color than the deep purple of Advent. Rose may also be used, where it is the custom, on Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday during Lent). On Passion Sunday (Palm Sunday) and on Good Friday (which has no Mass but a service remembering Christ’s passion) the color is red. White or violet is worn on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday (once again, there is no Mass but there are other services on Holy Saturday).
Easter: Easter Vigil though Pentecost
The Easter season begins with the Easter Vigil, which is celebrated after night falls on the evening before Easter Sunday. The season of Easter is a joyous, celebratory season. It begins with celebrating Christ’s resurrection and ends by celebrating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus. Christ’s ascension into Heaven is celebrated just prior to Pentecost. The Easter season last 50 days, from Easter Sunday through Pentecost. The liturgical colors of Easter are white, for most days, and red for Pentecost.
Ordinary Time after Pentecost: The day after Pentecost through the final day before Advent
(See the above section on Ordinary Time for the history of the term)
The second period of Ordinary Time is the longest liturgical season. Ordinary Time resumes after Pentecost and runs until the final Saturday before Advent. This period of Ordinary Time focuses on Christ’s reign as King of kings, and on the age of the Church. This is the age we live in now, which is the time between the age of the Apostles and the age of Christ’s second and final coming for which we are ever preparing. The final Sunday in Ordinary Time is the Feast of Christ the King; the Saturday after this feast is the final day of Ordinary time. Again, the liturgical color of Ordinary Time is green; however, as in all seasons, other appropriate colors are worn on particular feast days.

Which conditiondoes not distinctly describe an El Niño event?A. It is an oscillation of the ocean-temperature system in the tropical Pacific having important consequences for weatherand climate around the globe.B. The trade winds blow towards the west across the tropical Pacific. These winds pile up warm surface water in the westPacific, so that the sea surface is about 1/2 meter higher at Indonesia than at Ecuador.C. The trade winds relax in the central and western Pacific leading to a depression of the thermocline in the easternPacific, and an elevation of the thermocline in the west.D.

                            17. People stand in a long queue during the distribution of humanitarian aid near a damaged store of wholesaler Metro in the course of the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine March 24, 2022. REUTERS/AlexandeBRUSSELS/WASHINGTON — The United States plans to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion and is pledging $1 billion in new humanitarian aid, the Biden administration said on Thursday after a month of bombardments touched off Europe’s fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of World War Two.The announcement coincided with U.S. President Joe Biden’s meeting with European leaders in Brussels to coordinate the Western response to the crisis.More than 3.5 million people have fled since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, putting a strain on the neighboring European countries receiving them.U.S. lawmakers and advocates have urged Biden to do more to help those seeking refuge in the United States.In the first two weeks of March, seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States, internal U.S. State Department data seen by Reuters shows.Some Ukrainians have traveled to Mexico to seek U.S. asylum at the southwest border.A senior Biden official said the administration still expected many Ukrainians to choose to remain in Europe close to their home country but added the U.S. commitment to receive more people would relieve some pressure on European nations currently hosting the bulk of refugees fleeing the conflict, which Russia calls a “special military operation.”“We recognize that some number of Ukrainians who have fled may wish to come to the United States temporarily,” the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.The Biden administration said in a statement it would use “the full range of legal pathways” to bring Ukrainians to the United States, including the U.S. refugee resettlement program, which provides a path to citizenship.As part of the effort, Ukrainians may enter through existing visa avenues and through a relief program known as “humanitarian parole,” which allows people into the country on an emergency basis, the senior administration official said. The Biden administration said it will focus on Ukrainians with family members in the United States.Reuters reported details of the plans earlier this week.‘Lots of questions’Before the crisis erupted in Ukraine, Biden launched the largest U.S. resettlement effort since the Vietnam War by accepting about 80,000 Afghans – many arriving in a mass airlift operation – after U.S. troops left Afghanistan following 20 years of war.In contrast to the Afghan evacuation, however, the 100,000 Ukrainians would not necessarily be allowed into the United States all at once or even within the current fiscal year, which stretches until the end of September, the U.S. official said.About 355,000 Ukrainian immigrants live in the United States, according to data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a Washington-based think tank.Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with MPI, said that she welcomed the new U.S. commitments, but that “there are lots of questions” about how much, and how quickly, they could help.A Democrat, Biden set a goal to resettle 125,000 refugees this fiscal year, which began last October, a massive jump from former President Donald Trump, a Republican who slashed refugee levels. But amid COVID-19 delays and other challenges, only around 6,500 refugees from around the world have been admitted, far below Biden’s goal.For Ukrainians who have relatives in the United States, the administration will seek to speed up the processing of family-based visas for permanent residency.But placing Ukrainians through these legal pathways risks adding to an already ballooning backlog of hundreds of thousands of unprocessed visa applications, Gelatt said.The humanitarian parole program, another route the administration could use for Ukrainians, does not provide permanent status in the United States, meaning Ukrainians entering that way would face an uncertain future.Source: newsinfo.inquirer.net1.
