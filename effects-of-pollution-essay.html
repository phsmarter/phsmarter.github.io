                                            What is It How to write paragraphs with cause-and-effect, comparison-and-contrast, and problem-solution relationships? Cause and Effect Relationship A cause-and-effect text explains the reasons and results of events, situations, or trends. There are three patterns or types of cause-and-effect essays. Cause 1 Cause 2 Effect Cause 3 Multiple Causes-One Effect Cause 1 Cause 2 Cause 3 One Cause Effect 1 Effect 2 Effect 1 One Cause-Multiple Effects Effect 3 Effect 2 Effect 3 Cause-Effect Chain Read an example of a cause-and-effect paragraph below. Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air especially in highly urbanized towns and cities mainly because the government lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise, the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories that emit gas elsewhere. More often than not, air pollution is caused by natural events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, and pollen dispersal.​</a>

                            1. Write an essay about the effects of pollution to humans​</h2><br />
                        <p>Pollution is a term which even kids are aware of these days. It has become so common that almost everyone acknowledged the fact that pollution is rising continuously. When we talk about pollution on earth, we refer to the contamination that is happening caused by various pollutants. All of this are mainly caused by human activities which harm the environment in ways more than one. Pollution greatly affects the life of each one of us more than one can imagine. It works in mysterious ways, which sometimes cannot be seen by the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>One of these pollutions is 'Air Pollution'. It is made from harmful gases made by various harmful activities by humans. You might not be able to see the natural gases present in the air, but they're still there. Similarly, the pollutants which are damaging and messing up the air which cause the levels of carbon dioxide to increase is very dangerous for humans. The increasing level of carbon dioxide will lead to global warming.</p><p></p><p>'Water pollution', when the water is severely polluted it will cause a shortage of drinking water. Without water, human life is impossible. We know how important water is in our daily life, almost 70% of our body is water also more than 70% of earth is covered in water. Moreover, the way waste is dumped on the land eventually ends up in the soil and turns into toxic. If 'Land Pollution' keeps on happening at this rate, we won’t have fertile soil to grow our crops on. The main source of our food supply will be greatly affected. </p><p></p><p>Lastly, 'Noise Pollution' can be defined as any disturbing or unwanted noise that interferes or harms humans or wildlife. Although noise constantly surrounds us, noise pollution generally receives less attention than water quality and air quality issues because it cannot be seen, tasted, or smelled. </p><p>Therefore, serious measures must be taken to reduce these pollutions.</p><p></p><p>(gnamit ko to sa mapeh ko lol sna makatulong..) - 3/30/21</p><br />

                            2. C. Make an essay about the effects of pollution to humans.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> The earth slowly decaying by simple reasons of pollution, ripping the earth raw of its minerals, and just simply not cleaning up our messes. Is it too late for the world to go green or is it better to just let the Earth rot away and search and search for a new planet that can support human life? Our earth has gone from a beautiful green and blue ball of pure perfection to just a dirt sphere of multiple flaws that we have caused. The glaciers in Antarctica are starting to melt and the planet is dying and I don’t think it’s too late to turn away from the way we treat our beloved Earth. Pollution is a major reason to why the Earth is the way it is. The health of wildlife, plant life and human life are decreasing enormously. Air pollution is increasing every day. Our factories and our vehicles are poisoning the air. Air pollution has a great affect on us believe it or not. It, affects our reproductive system, our lungs, and it can affect the birth defects our children have. Air pollution doesn’t only have effect on us personally it has effect on the things around us. The food we eat and the animals around us. Air pollution contaminates toxins that are absorbed by plants and water.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pollution is a term which even kids are aware of these days. It has become so common that almost everyone acknowledged the fact that pollution is rising continuously. When we talk about pollution on earth, we refer to the contamination that is happening caused by various pollutants. All of this are mainly caused by human activities which harm the environment in ways more than one. Pollution greatly affects the life of each one of us more than one can imagine. It works in mysterious ways, which sometimes cannot be seen by the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>One of these pollutions is 'Air Pollution'. It is made from harmful gases made by various harmful activities by humans. You might not be able to see the natural gases present in the air, but they're still there. Similarly, the pollutants which are damaging and messing up the air which cause the levels of carbon dioxide to increase is very dangerous for humans. The increasing level of carbon dioxide will lead to global warming.</p><p></p><p>'Water pollution', when the water is severely polluted it will cause a shortage of drinking water. Without water, human life is impossible. We know how important water is in our daily life, almost 70% of our body is water also more than 70% of earth is covered in water. Moreover, the way waste is dumped on the land eventually ends up in the soil and turns into toxic. If 'Land Pollution' keeps on happening at this rate, we won’t have fertile soil to grow our crops on. The main source of our food supply will be greatly affected.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, 'Noise Pollution' can be defined as any disturbing or unwanted noise that interferes or harms humans or wildlife. Although noise constantly surrounds us, noise pollution generally receives less attention than water quality and air quality issues because it cannot be seen, tasted, or smelled.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, serious measures must be taken to reduce these pollutions.</p><p></p><p>here!</p><br />

Cause and Effect Relationship A cause-and-effect text explains the reasons and results of events, situations, or trends. There are three patterns or types of cause-and-effect essays. Cause 1 Cause 2 Effect Cause 3 Multiple Causes-One Effect Cause 1 Cause 2 Cause 3 One Cause Effect 1 Effect 2 Effect 1 One Cause-Multiple Effects Effect 3 Effect 2 Effect 3 Cause-Effect Chain Read an example of a cause-and-effect paragraph below. Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air especially in highly urbanized towns and cities mainly because the government lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise, the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories that emit gas elsewhere. More often than not, air pollution is caused by natural events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, and pollen dispersal.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Writing paragraphs with cause-and-effect, comparison-and-contrast, and problem-solution relationships involves identifying the relationship between two or more concepts and presenting them in a coherent manner.</p><p></p><p>For a cause-and-effect paragraph, the writer should clearly explain the causes and effects of an event, situation, or trend. There are different patterns or types of cause-and-effect relationships, including single and multiple causes with one or multiple effects, as well as a cause-effect chain. The writer should use transition words and phrases to connect the causes and effects, such as "because," "therefore," "as a result," and "consequently."</p><p></p><p>Here is an example of a cause-and-effect paragraph on air pollution:</p><p></p><p>Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events.

The paragraph should start with a clear statement of the problem and its impact. The solution should be presented in a logical and organized manner, with supporting evidence and examples. The writer should use transition words and phrases such as "one solution is," "the best approach is," and "to solve this problem" to signal the solution. The paragraph should end with a call to action or a recommendation for the reader.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, writing paragraphs with cause-and-effect, comparison-and-contrast, and problem-solution relationships requires a clear understanding of the concepts being discussed and their interrelationships. The writer should use appropriate transitional words and phrases to guide the reader through the text and provide supporting evidence and examples to enhance their understanding.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pa brainliest po If my answer are correct for you and Thanks</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answers:</strong> Noise pollution- unwanted or excessive sound that can have deleterious effects on human health, wildlife and environmental quality.
</p><p>	It is commonly generated inside many industrial facilities and some other workplaces, but it also comes from highway, railway, and airplane traffic and from outdoor construction activities
. Noise is more than a mere nuisance.  It can cause physical damage to the eardrum and the sensitive hair cells of the inner ears and result in temporary or permanent hearing loss, known as noise-induced hearing loss.  Excessive noise exposure can raise blood pressure and pulse rates; cause   irritability; can anxiety and mental fatigue; and interfere with sleep, recreation and personal communication,  stress, impairments in memory and attention span. Noise pollution control is important in the workplace and in the community.  It can interfere with an animal’s ability to attract mate, communicate, navigate, find food or avoid predators.  It is serious for marine animals.  Noise control ordinances an laws enacted at the local, regional and national levels can be effective.  Low levels of noise may be overcome using additional absorbing material such as heavy drapery or sound absorbent tiles in enclosed rooms; using hearing protectors.</p><br />

It has a number of different emission sources, but motor vehicles and industrial processes contribute the major part of air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, six major air pollutants include particle pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. Long and short term exposure to air suspended toxicants has a different toxicological impact on human including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric complications, the eyes irritation, skin diseases, and long-term chronic diseases such as cancer.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>i use Claim-counterclaim</p><p></p><p>Requiring students to wear school uniforms has been a topic of debate among educators, parents, and students for years. Supporters argue that school uniforms promote a sense of unity and equality among students. According to a study conducted by the National Association of Elementary School Principals, schools that require uniforms have seen a decrease in discipline problems and an increase in academic performance. By eliminating the pressure to wear the latest fashion trends, students can focus more on their studies and less on their appearance. Additionally, school uniforms can help level the playing field for students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, as everyone is dressed similarly.</p><p></p><p>However, opponents argue that mandatory school uniforms limit students' self-expression and creativity. Wearing uniforms can stifle individuality and prevent students from expressing their unique personalities. Furthermore, requiring school uniforms can be costly for families, especially those with multiple children. Parents may have to spend more money on clothing to comply with the school's uniform policy, which can be a financial burden. Additionally, enforcing a uniform policy can be a challenge for schools, as they must ensure that students are wearing the correct attire and that the policy is being followed consistently.</p><p></p><p>(if you want to add)</p><p>In conclusion, while requiring students to wear school uniforms may have some benefits, it is important to consider the drawbacks as well. Schools should weigh the potential benefits against the potential costs before implementing a uniform policy. Moreover, if a school does decide to require uniforms, they should ensure that the policy is fair, consistent, and takes into account the financial burden it may place on families.</p><p> </p><br />
