For many months, he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom,and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that it was all he wanted.As graduation day was approaching, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morningof his graduation, his father called him into his private study room. His father told him how much he loved him. He handed his sona beautiful wrapped gift box Curious but somehow disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather-boundBible. Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said,"With all your money, you give me a Bible?" and stormed out of the house, leaving the holy book.Many years passed and the young man was very successful in his business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family.He realized his father was very old and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Beforehe could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away and willed all of his possessions to hisson. He needed to come home immediately and took care of things.When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search his father's importantpapers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it few years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn pages. Ashe read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealerwho had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words... PAID IN FULL.How many times do we miss God's blessings because they are not packed as what we expected?~~~The EndI.

                                            thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.

                                            Friends can be classified according to their honesty, loyalty, the type that fits you into theirschedule, or the type that finds time for you when they need something. An honest friend tellsyou the truth even if it’s not always what you want to hear. In the long run, that honest friend mayhave saved you from embarrassment or possibly rejection. They give you constructivecriticisms overall. A loyal friend is the type of friend that will be there for you through thick andthin. They don’t care how good or bad you may look one day; they are sensitive to your feelings,they respect you and the other people in your life, and most of all they will never let you downwhen times are hard. They may be what you call a best friend. The third group, the person thatfits you into their schedule, is the type of person that is always on the go. They barely have timefor themselves let alone another person. More than likely they will not be there for you whenyou need them most, because they are so wrapped up in their busy, hectic life. Then you havethe self-absorbent type of friend that finds time for you only when they need something. Thistype of person isn’t what you would call a friend. This person may always be extremely nice toyou because they know that if they are nice to you then they will more than likely get what theywant. They will call you every once in a while when it is almost time for them to use that personagain. It may be for a ride to work, home or they just want somebody to hang out with becausethey have no other friends. If the person that is being used is smart they will eventually realizethat they are getting used and will stop being there for that person. 1. What are the three types of friends?2.

                        <p><strong>B. Self-Love:</strong></p><p></p><p>Loving yourself provides you with self-confidence, self-worth, and in general, you feel more positive. If you can learn to love yourself, you will feel happier and will learn to take better care of yourself.</p><p></p><p>Looking in the mirror, most of us see a lot of different flaws and remember too many past experiences and failings to love ourselves. The less you love yourself, listen to yourself, and understand yourself, the more confused, upset, and frustrated you will be in life. When you begin to love yourself and continue to love yourself more and more each day, things slowly will be a little bit better in every way possible.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, self-love isn’t always easy. </p><p></p><p>Accepting the pain and allowing yourself to be honest with who you are is a big step to loving yourself. Forgive yourself for past actions and things you are ashamed of doing.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a lot of negative emotions like jealousy, disgust, and rage can have a negative impact. We need to learn how to accept not only the emotions that create love, joy, and happiness but also the ones that cause fear, insecurity, and anger in our lives.</p><p></p><p>While we need to learn how to acknowledge and accept the pain with the love, another step is reconciling with a cold and unopened heart. Asking yourself if you fully love yourself can be very difficult because you must accept your flaws and faults.</p><p></p><p>Love is something we choose, the same way we choose anger, hate, or sadness. We have the power to forgive someone who has hurt us in the past. We can learn to finally heal from something when we can forgive. We can always choose love.</p><p></p><p>Learning to love yourself leads to better self-care. Examples of this could be taking a break from time to time and accepting that no one is perfect and things happen.</p><p></p><p>Another example could be saying no to others when you really don’t have the time or energy to say yes. We often do too much for other people because we want to please everyone. We can forget to look after ourselves and then we become overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Today is the day you can love yourself completely with no expectations. Making the choice right now to choose your own love is the most powerful healing force you have.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps...</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            10. thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.
