The aim is to take this learning into new experiences, completing the cycle.Effective learning is seen when a person progresses through a cycle of four stages: of (1) having a concrete experience followed by (2) observation of and reflection on that experience which leads to (3) the formation of abstract concepts (analysis) and generalizations (conclusions) which are then (4) used to test hypothesis in future situations, resulting in new experiences.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana makatulong</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Purposive communication is a type of communication that is intentional and goal-oriented. It involves the use of language and other forms of communication to achieve a specific objective or purpose. In my studies of purposive communication, I have learned about the importance of effective communication in achieving personal and professional goals.</p><p></p><p>One of the key things I have learned about purposive communication is that it requires careful planning and preparation. Before engaging in purposive communication, it is important to identify the objectives and goals that you want to achieve. This involves understanding the audience that you are communicating with, their needs, and their expectations. By doing so, you can tailor your message to meet their specific needs and ensure that your communication is effective.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication is the use of clear and concise language. Effective communication requires that you use language that is easy to understand and that conveys your message clearly. This means avoiding jargon or technical terms that may not be familiar to your audience. By using simple and straightforward language, you can ensure that your message is understood and that your communication is effective.</p><p></p><p>I have also learned that purposive communication requires active listening. This means paying attention to the needs and concerns of your audience and responding appropriately. Effective communication requires that you listen to feedback and adjust your message accordingly. By doing so, you can ensure that your communication is relevant and meets the needs of your audience.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these key principles, I have also learned about the importance of nonverbal communication in purposive communication. Nonverbal communication includes things like body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. These nonverbal cues can convey important information about your message and can help to reinforce your message. By paying attention to your nonverbal communication, you can ensure that your message is received and understood by your audience.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my studies of purposive communication have taught me that effective communication is essential for achieving personal and professional goals. By carefully planning and preparing your message, using clear and concise language, actively listening to your audience, and paying attention to your nonverbal communication, you can ensure that your communication is effective and achieves its intended purpose. Whether you are communicating with colleagues, clients, or friends and family, these principles of purposive communication can help you to communicate more effectively and achieve your goals.</p><br />

                            6. make a reflection, of what you have learn on prilem discussion about purposive communication (essay)​500 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the preliminary discussion about purposive communication, I have learned about the importance of effective communication in achieving our goals and objectives. Purposive communication is a type of communication that focuses on achieving specific outcomes or objectives. It involves planning, organizing, and delivering a message in a way that is clear, concise, and understandable to the intended audience.</p><p></p><p>One of the key takeaways from the discussion is the role of context in purposive communication. The context refers to the environment or situation in which the communication takes place. It includes the physical setting, social norms, cultural values, and other factors that can influence the meaning and interpretation of the message. To communicate effectively, it is important to consider the context and adapt the message accordingly. For example, when communicating with people from different cultures or backgrounds, it is important to be sensitive to their values and beliefs and adjust the message to avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication is the use of language. The language we use can greatly influence how our message is perceived and understood by others. It is important to use language that is appropriate for the audience, clear, and concise. We should avoid using jargon, technical terms, or complicated language that can confuse or alienate the audience. We should also consider the tone of our message and ensure that it is respectful, courteous, and professional.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the discussion highlighted the importance of feedback in purposive communication. Feedback allows us to assess the effectiveness of our communication and make necessary adjustments. By soliciting feedback from the audience, we can identify areas for improvement and adjust our communication strategy accordingly.</p><p></p><p>In terms of qualities that make a good communicator, I have learned that it is important to be clear, concise, and confident when delivering a message. A good communicator should be able to convey their message in a way that is easily understood and engaging to the audience. They should also be able to adapt their communication style to suit the needs of the audience and the context. Good communicators are also active listeners, which means they are able to receive and interpret feedback from the audience and make necessary adjustments to their message.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the preliminary discussion on purposive communication has been very informative and insightful. It has highlighted the importance of effective communication in achieving our goals and objectives, and the key factors that contribute to successful communication. It has also emphasized the importance of adapting our communication style to suit the needs of the audience and the context. As a learner, I am now more aware of the qualities that make a good communicator, and I will strive to develop these qualities in my own communication style.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As an AI language model, I do not have the capacity to learn for insight or generate original thoughts. However, based on commonly observed trends from students, the following is a suggested reflection about quarter 1:</p><p></p><p>In quarter 1 of Science 8, I have learned an array of new concepts that have helped me understand the world around me. One of the most exciting things I learned about is the properties of matter, which includes observing their physical and chemical properties, classification, and changes that they undergo. Furthermore, I was fascinated by the discoveries about the fundamental unit of life, the cell. I learned that the cell has unique parts with specific functions, and how it is the building block of all living things.</p><p></p><p>Another significant unit that I learned in the first quarter of Science 8 was about energy transformation. I grasped how energy is converted from one form to another, and the implications of the conservation of energy. This knowledge has helped me understand the sources of energy and their availability.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, I learned about the body's systems and its numerous functions, including the respiratory, digestive, nervous, and circulatory systems. I was intrigued by how these body reactions are co-ordinated for normal life processes.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the first quarter of Science 8 has been engaging, and it has helped me better understand the functioning of the natural world. The experience of experimenting with different ideas and concepts has been enlightening, and I am looking forward to what the next quarter will bring.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The most significant lesson I have learned about communication is that it is more important to listen than to talk. It's the listener who stays back to ask questions because the data being transmitted would have been taken in. Listening is more critical than speaking, for "There is a reason why we have two ears and only one mouth," as the old adage goes.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Data Analysis and Interpretation</p><p>The objective of this chapter is to describe the procedures used in the analysis of the data and present the main findings. It also presents the different tests performed to help choose the appropriate model for the study. The chapter concludes by providing thorough statistical interpretation of the findings. </p><p></p><p>The research data was analyzed using a statistical software called STATA. Before running the data for the regression analysis, panel unit-root test was performed to see if data is stationary over time so that it can be used in estimating the variables in question. The value of the variables in the model throughout the research period is not constant; that means, there are some periods where there are spikes. These periods of ups and downs in value of economic variables are called shock in economic jargon. The notion behind testing for stationarity is to identify whether the effect of such shocks is permanent or transitory. If the effect of such shocks is temporary, the subsequent values of the variables will return to their long term equilibrium suggesting that the data is stable even with the presence of shocks. </p><br />

</p><p>REFLECTION ESSAY
</p><p>As I sit down to reflect on my time in the English major at Berry, I’m roughly three
</p><p>months removed from my last English class. At the moment, I’m in the middle of a semesterlong student teaching experience at Armuchee High School, finishing out my Secondary
</p><p>Education minor and preparing for the “real world” of teaching that awaits me after May 10th
</p><p>.
</p><p>At this point, I’ve got some well-needed temporal, as well as practical, distance between myself
</p><p>and the English classes that were a staple of my time at Berry. Truth be told, I miss them. On a
</p><p>more relevant note, I’m thankful for them. In combination with my own extensive
</p><p>extracurricular studies of literature – e.g. my annual summer reading and research projects
</p><p>with books like Ulysses, Gravity’s Rainbow, and Infinite Jest – my English studies at Berry have
</p><p>not only given me knowledge that I am using right now in the high school classroom but also
</p><p>made me an overall better, more critical reader and writer. The discussions I’ve had (or rather,
</p><p>given my introverted nature, mostly observed) in class have shown me how to engage with
</p><p>others in good intellectual discussion and how a single text can be approached and analyzed
</p><p>from a variety of angles. The connections I’ve made with professors, both in and out of the
</p><p>classroom, have shown me much the same while giving me intellectual and personal role
</p><p>models to look up to. In short, my experience as an English major at Berry has been an
</p><p>enriching one, one that has prepared me both professionally and personally for the years after
</p><p>graduation.
</p><p>Coming to Berry in the fall of 2010, I knew from the start that I was going to be an
</p><p>English major and Secondary Education minor. It wasn’t until the spring of 2012, though, that I  </p><p>was able to start taking “real” English classes: classes that were more a part of the major than
</p><p>of the general education curriculum. One such class, Western Literary Tradition (ENG 337), gave
</p><p>me a thorough understanding of the texts that formed the basis of the literary canon, which is
</p><p>essential to understanding the interaction between texts that makes up Western literature as a
</p><p>whole. Taken at the same time, Introduction to Literary Studies (ENG 240) gave me a solid
</p><p>foundation in the varying critical perspectives that make up literary criticism while also
</p><p>exposing me to a great number of varying literary works, which has been especially helpful as I
</p><p>begin to choose the material I teach to my high school students. Both classes in combination
</p><p>with each other allowed me to enter the critical conversation myself and forced me into a
</p><p>deeper understanding of the works themselves by engaging with literary criticism from a
</p><p>variety of theoretical perspectives.
</p><p>One can see this explicitly in the literature review done for ENG 240 on Joyce Carol
</p><p>Oates’ “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?”It is part of the three main essays at the
</p><p>beginning of this portfolio. As with most of the work done for ENG 240, this writing assignment
</p><p>allowed me to thoroughly examine a story that I had never encountered before. By reading
</p><p>numerous critical pieces, I became more aware of the vast critical conversation that can take
</p><p>place around even a single short story. By having to synthesize those pieces into one whole, I
</p><p>engaged more deeply with the story itself, judging the persuasive arguments of the literary
</p><p>criticism I was reading against my own personal thoughts about the story and reconciling the
</p><p>two through my writing.

                            19. make a reflection, of what you have learn on midterm discussion about purposive communication (essay)​500 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Purposive communication is a type of communication that is intentional, goal-oriented, and aimed at achieving specific objectives. It involves the use of language, symbols, and other forms of communication to convey a message that is meant to influence the thoughts, feelings, or actions of the receiver. The concept of purposive communication was discussed in detail during the midterm discussion, and I learned a lot about its importance and how it can be used effectively.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the key things that I learned about purposive communication is that it is essential for achieving success in various fields, including business, politics, and social activism. In these areas, effective communication is crucial for influencing people's opinions, gaining support, and achieving goals. For example, a business leader who wants to persuade investors to invest in their company must use purposive communication to convey a message that highlights the company's strengths and potential for growth. Similarly, a politician who wants to win an election must use purposive communication to persuade voters to support their campaign.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication that I learned about is the need to tailor the message to the audience. Different audiences have different needs, interests, and values, and effective communication requires an understanding of these differences. For example, a social activist who wants to raise awareness about a particular issue must use language and symbols that resonate with the target audience. This may involve using different communication channels, such as social media, to reach different groups of people.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I also learned that nonverbal communication plays a significant role in purposive communication. Nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice, can convey important information about a person's emotions, intentions, and attitudes. Effective communicators must be aware of these nonverbal cues and use them to enhance the impact of their message.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Finally, I learned that effective communication requires practice and feedback. Like any skill, communication can be improved through practice and feedback. This may involve seeking feedback from others, such as colleagues or mentors, to identify areas for improvement. It may also involve practicing different communication techniques, such as active listening, to improve one's ability to communicate effectively.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the midterm discussion on purposive communication was a valuable learning experience that taught me a lot about the importance of effective communication in achieving specific objectives. I learned that effective communication requires an understanding of the audience, the use of nonverbal cues, and the need for practice and feedback. I believe that these lessons will be valuable not only in my personal and professional life but also in helping me to become a more effective communicator overall.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>answer with knowledge and valid opinions to help and guide the questioners‚ no copies from anyone or any website‚ pa brainliest.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Relevance is critical in any discussion, debate, or analysis. It directs the conversation towards a specific topic and ensures that all opinions and insights are considered. When relevance is lacking in a conversation, it can result in unfocused discussion or confusion.</p><p></p><p>Truthfulness is always significant. It ensures that the information provided is accurate and without distortion, omissions, or fabrication. In any dialogue, we must always consider the authenticity of the information, to avoid misleading others.</p><p></p><p>Prejudice and bias can significantly affect our positions and actions. Prejudice is an irrational and negative opinion or feeling towards a person, group, or community. It causes us to make decisions based on stereotypes, rather than facts, which can be detrimental to individuals or communities. Bias is an inclination towards or against something or someone, leading us to take a one-sided position.</p><p></p><p>The seven types of disorders that affect individuals from different cultures includes anxiety disorders, mood disorders, personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychotic disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse. While society may stigmatize these conditions, it is essential to be mindful of the struggles individuals with these conditions face and to provide support and resources to help them overcome them.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, relevance, truthfulness, prejudice, bias, and disorders are all critical factors that need to be considered. As individuals and society, we must ensure that we base our decisions on accurate information, avoid prejudices and biases, and provide support to individuals struggling with disorders. By doing so, we can improve our interactions and develop more inclusive, supportive communities.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Concentration of a solution can be defined as the amount of the solute in a fixed amount of a solvent or a solution. Concentration can be expressed in many different ways. A few of them are: percent composition, parts per million, parts per billion, molarity, molality, normality and formality. The most commonly used is the molarity, which is defined as the number of moles of solute present in one litre of the solution. Knowing the concentration of solutions is a very important aspect, specifically in the field of medicine. In case of a medicine is prescribed by a doctor, the concentration of the components present in the medicine play an important role. The intravenous injections given to us have the same concentration of the solute as the concentration of the solute present in the blood. It means the solution in case of the medicine should be isotonic with the blood. If it is not, then the movement of the substances will take pace either into the cells or out of the cells, which might make the cells swell or shrink. The purpose of this lab is to find the concentration of the unknown solution, located at the front. If more water is added to the substance, then the solution will become less concentrated with the copper sulphate substance. </p><br />

                            29. make a reflection, of what you have learn on midterm discussion about purposive communication (essay)​500 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Throughout the midterm discussion on purposive communication, I have gained a deeper understanding of how communication should be used to fulfill a specific purpose. From learning about the different components of effective communication to the various contexts in which it is used, I have come to appreciate the significance of communication in our daily lives.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, I have learned that effective communication involves several key elements such as sender, receiver, message, and feedback. These aspects work together to ensure that the intended message is conveyed accurately and received as intended. Additionally, I have come to understand the importance of tailoring the message to suit the audience, considering their age, cultural background, and social status, among other factors.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have learned about the various contexts in which communication is used, such as in interpersonal communication, public speaking, and group communication. In each context, there are unique communication skills required to achieve the desired purpose. For instance, in public speaking, one needs to be skilled in articulating their thoughts and capturing the attention of the audience. The importance of nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone, has also been emphasized, as they can convey additional meaning to the intended message.</p><p></p><p>Another critical aspect of communication that I have learned is the significance of purpose in communication. In purposive communication, the aim is to achieve specific goals or objectives, such as persuading, informing, or entertaining. This means that communication should be planned and executed in a way that best suits the intended purpose. For instance, when seeking to persuade, it is essential to use persuasive language, emotional appeals, and logical arguments to achieve the desired outcome.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the role of technology in communication has been highlighted. In today's digital age, communication has significantly evolved with the use of various social media platforms, instant messaging apps, and email communication. However, despite the convenience and ease of using technology to communicate, it should be used cautiously, considering the diverse audiences and contexts in which communication takes place. Hence, it is crucial to use discretion, civility, and professionalism when communicating through technology.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Thats your 500 words essay</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As I sit down to reflect on my time in the English major at Berry, I’m roughly three
</p><p>months removed from my last English class. At the moment, I’m in the middle of a semesterlong student teaching experience at Armuchee High School, finishing out my Secondary
</p><p>Education minor and preparing for the “real world” of teaching that awaits me after May 10th
</p><p>.
</p><p>At this point, I’ve got some well-needed temporal, as well as practical, distance between myself
</p><p>and the English classes that were a staple of my time at Berry. Truth be told, I miss them. On a
</p><p>more relevant note, I’m thankful for them. In combination with my own extensive
</p><p>extracurricular studies of literature – e.g. my annual summer reading and research projects
</p><p>with books like Ulysses, Gravity’s Rainbow, and Infinite Jest – my English studies at Berry have
</p><p>not only given me knowledge that I am using right now in the high school classroom but also
</p><p>made me an overall better, more critical reader and writer. The discussions I’ve had (or rather,
</p><p>given my introverted nature, mostly observed) in class have shown me how to engage with
</p><p>others in good intellectual discussion and how a single text can be approached and analyzed
</p><p>from a variety of angles. The connections I’ve made with professors, both in and out of the
</p><p>classroom, have shown me much the same while giving me intellectual and personal role
</p><p>models to look up to. In short, my experience as an English major at Berry has been an
</p><p>enriching one, one that has prepared me both professionally and personally for the years after
</p><p>graduation.
</p><p>Coming to Berry in the fall of 2010, I knew from the start that I was going to be an
</p><p>English major and Secondary Education minor. It wasn’t until the spring of 2012, though, that I  </p><p>was able to start taking “real” English classes: classes that were more a part of the major than
</p><p>of the general education curriculum. One such class, Western Literary Tradition (ENG 337), gave
</p><p>me a thorough understanding of the texts that formed the basis of the literary canon, which is
</p><p>essential to understanding the interaction between texts that makes up Western literature as a
</p><p>whole. Taken at the same time, Introduction to Literary Studies (ENG 240) gave me a solid
</p><p>foundation in the varying critical perspectives that make up literary criticism while also
</p><p>exposing me to a great number of varying literary works, which has been especially helpful as I
</p><p>begin to choose the material I teach to my high school students. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
