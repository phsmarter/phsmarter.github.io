                                            What is quantitative research?By definition, quantitative research is an objective, systematic empiricalinvestigation of observable phenomena through the use of computational techniques. Ithighlights numerical analysis of data hoping that the numbers yield unbiased results thatcan be generalized to some larger population and explain a particular observation(Faltado III et al., 2016)Moreover, Baraceros (2016) expounded that expressions like numerical forms,objective thinking, statistical methods, and measurement signal the existence ofquantitative research. It involves measurements and amounts and seeks to find answersto questions how many, how much, how long, to what extent and the like.Finding out how many students eat at the school canteen every lunch time, or howmuch allowance do senior high school students have every day is quantitative.Quantitative vs. QualitativeSo, how is quantitative research different from qualitative research? One word thatreflects the true nature of quantitative research is numerical. On the other hand,qualitative is subjective, interpretive, exploratory and requires heavy narratives.To be more specific, quantitative research deals with numbers, collects data whichcan be measured like length, height, area, volume, weight, speed, time, temperature,humidity, sound levels, costs, members, ages, scores, etc. while qualitative research dealswith description, and collects data which can be observed but not measured like colors,textures, smells, tastes, appearance, beauty, etc.Thus, you conduct a qualitative research when you want to know the commonthemes in Shakespeare's works but you conduct a quantitative research when you want toknow how many sonnets and plays he wrote.You employ quantitative research in finding out the IQ levels of the Grade 7students; however, you do qualitative research in describing the hardships andchallenges faced by the working students.Think about a headline you read from a newspaper, listened from a radio orwatched from the television. Ask 5 quantitative questions about it.​</a>

Know what to expect!•Outline the parts you'll presentKnow your research forwards and backwards. Rather than writing out your opening statement verbatim, use an outline to plan yout main and supporting points. In the opening statement you'll want to introduce your project, the questions that drove your research, your methods, and your results (and how your results are significant).•Attend another defenseChances are good that you've attended colleagues' defenses for the last few years. If you haven't, attend a few so you can see what they're like—from the format to the types of questions that are asked.•Talk to colleagues who've successfully defendedLearn more about the dynamics in the defense and how defenses have gone in the past. Their experiences (and living proof that students survive this experience!) can help you feel more comfortable with your own. •Anticipate possible questionsSpend time thinking about what your committee might ask (keep their own areas of interest in mind!), and outline how you can address concerns they might raise. As with outlining the introduction, think about the main points you want to address when you answer the question.•Practice, Practice, PracticeAs you prepare, don't just write down what you plan to say during your presentation, or answers to potential questions. Speak aloud to get comfortable with the flow of ideas. This practice may make it easier for you to anticipate how others will respond to your thoughts, and that in turn will help you be better prepared.•Dress the partHow you present yourself affects how your committee members see you and also how you see yourself. Whether you invest in a whole new outfit or simply a pair of shoes that are your "defense shoes," make an effort to present "the best you."•Have an answer ready (for questions you don't know the answer to)Your committee will be trying to identify the edge of what you know, and gauging your response when you're confronted with it. It's best to recognize and admit  it when your research didn't address this topic, or if you just don't know the answer. If you're not sure you understood the question, rephrase it. If appropriate, you might explain why your dissertation research didn't address the specific point, that the posed question could lead to further research, and you might improvise what a project designed to answer the question might look like. By showing that you could synthesize an answer, even while acknowledging that you do not know the answer, shows that you can effectively think on your feet and know the ways your field can be expanded.•Don't interruptIf the members of your committee are hashing things out over a smaller detail of your work or they're discussing tangential topics, use the time to sit back, take a sip of water, and regroup.​</a>

                        Will the Earth Melt Soon?Introduction<p>The ice glaciers are melting, but the Earth won't. Since the 1950s, Earth's glaciers have been slowly melting as climate change continues to advance. Particularly in mountain glaciers all throughout the world, in Antarctica, and Greenland. Although the ice glaciers in these locations will melt, the Earth won't. Although this might be the cause of the sea levels rising, the ocean would overrun all the coastal cities and a large portion of the land would be submerged. This is the result of climate change that has been continuously deteriorating due to human activity, which has led to the buildup of greenhouse gases that are impacting the warming effect. </p><p></p><p>We could learn how to stop this issue from getting worse so that it doesn't impact all of Earth's life in this study. We might also devise means of determining whether this will cause more significant issues. </p><p></p>Description of the Issue<p>This phenomenon is primarily the result of human activity. In particular, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have increased temperatures in the poles since the industrial revolution. Consequently, glaciers are melting quickly, breaking off into the ocean, and retreating on land. We need to find various strategies to stop this from happening because it could lead to a bigger issue in the future for the next generations. This could serve as a reminder to everyone to avoid practices like deforestation that can exacerbate climate change.</p><p></p>Relevance of the Study<p>This study could be useful in providing additional details on how to address the issue and in educating the public about how negatively their daily activities may impact the environment and pose a significant threat in the future.</p><p></p>Methodology<p>The goal of this research is to discover more strategies to stop glaciers from melting, which could cause more serious issues in the future. To locate the answers to the study questions, I will use online navigation to collect data from several verified websites on the internet.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about the concept paper here:</strong> https://brainly.ph/question/2433638#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

By that time, all life on Earth will have died out. This could be the source of rising sea levels, which could force the ocean to submerge all coastal communities. We need to come up with new remedies or strategies to prevent this from happening in the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION :</strong></p><p>What can we do to save the earth?

                            27. What is quantitative research?By definition, quantitative research is an objective, systematic empiricalinvestigation of observable phenomena through the use of computational techniques. Ithighlights numerical analysis of data hoping that the numbers yield unbiased results thatcan be generalized to some larger population and explain a particular observation(Faltado III et al., 2016)Moreover, Baraceros (2016) expounded that expressions like numerical forms,objective thinking, statistical methods, and measurement signal the existence ofquantitative research. It involves measurements and amounts and seeks to find answersto questions how many, how much, how long, to what extent and the like.Finding out how many students eat at the school canteen every lunch time, or howmuch allowance do senior high school students have every day is quantitative.Quantitative vs. QualitativeSo, how is quantitative research different from qualitative research? One word thatreflects the true nature of quantitative research is numerical. On the other hand,qualitative is subjective, interpretive, exploratory and requires heavy narratives.To be more specific, quantitative research deals with numbers, collects data whichcan be measured like length, height, area, volume, weight, speed, time, temperature,humidity, sound levels, costs, members, ages, scores, etc. while qualitative research dealswith description, and collects data which can be observed but not measured like colors,textures, smells, tastes, appearance, beauty, etc.Thus, you conduct a qualitative research when you want to know the commonthemes in Shakespeare's works but you conduct a quantitative research when you want toknow how many sonnets and plays he wrote.You employ quantitative research in finding out the IQ levels of the Grade 7students; however, you do qualitative research in describing the hardships andchallenges faced by the working students.Think about a headline you read from a newspaper, listened from a radio orwatched from the television. Ask 5 quantitative questions about it.​</h2><br />

                            30. Here are a few tips to help prepare you for the defense:• Learn about the structureAsk your advisor about how the defense will be organized. Most defenses begin with a public presentation by the student, followed by a question and answer period alone with your committee. Know what to expect!•Outline the parts you'll presentKnow your research forwards and backwards. Rather than writing out your opening statement verbatim, use an outline to plan yout main and supporting points. In the opening statement you'll want to introduce your project, the questions that drove your research, your methods, and your results (and how your results are significant).•Attend another defenseChances are good that you've attended colleagues' defenses for the last few years. If you haven't, attend a few so you can see what they're like—from the format to the types of questions that are asked.•Talk to colleagues who've successfully defendedLearn more about the dynamics in the defense and how defenses have gone in the past. Their experiences (and living proof that students survive this experience!) can help you feel more comfortable with your own. •Anticipate possible questionsSpend time thinking about what your committee might ask (keep their own areas of interest in mind!), and outline how you can address concerns they might raise. As with outlining the introduction, think about the main points you want to address when you answer the question.•Practice, Practice, PracticeAs you prepare, don't just write down what you plan to say during your presentation, or answers to potential questions. Speak aloud to get comfortable with the flow of ideas. This practice may make it easier for you to anticipate how others will respond to your thoughts, and that in turn will help you be better prepared.•Dress the partHow you present yourself affects how your committee members see you and also how you see yourself. Whether you invest in a whole new outfit or simply a pair of shoes that are your "defense shoes," make an effort to present "the best you."•Have an answer ready (for questions you don't know the answer to)Your committee will be trying to identify the edge of what you know, and gauging your response when you're confronted with it. It's best to recognize and admit  it when your research didn't address this topic, or if you just don't know the answer. If you're not sure you understood the question, rephrase it. If appropriate, you might explain why your dissertation research didn't address the specific point, that the posed question could lead to further research, and you might improvise what a project designed to answer the question might look like. By showing that you could synthesize an answer, even while acknowledging that you do not know the answer, shows that you can effectively think on your feet and know the ways your field can be expanded.•Don't interruptIf the members of your committee are hashing things out over a smaller detail of your work or they're discussing tangential topics, use the time to sit back, take a sip of water, and regroup.​</h2><br />
