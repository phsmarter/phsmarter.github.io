                                            Anger is having a feeling of hatred toward someone or something. It is one of ourbasic emotions and can be most dangerous if it is not carefully controlled. A person canbecome angry when he cannot fulfill some basic needs or desire that is important to him.For example, a child may become angry when he cannot play outside with his friends. Anadult may become angry when he does not receive a raise in pay that he expected.Mentally, anger can interfere with our thoughts, making it difficult to think clearly.Physically, it may cause violent reactions in our muscles and in the nervous systern. Thiscauses an angry person to flush and tremble and to show other signs of disturbance. Aperson can be dangerous if he is in an angry mood because he can develop feelings ofhostility and hatred toward another person, which can then often turn violent.Questions:1.

Copy the sentences that express opinion then underline the opinion-marking signals used in each sentence. Families are an integral part of one's life. I am confident to say that the family nerves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. It's my belief that the basic knowledge about one's culture and identity comes from the family only. I know you will have to agree that that we are a reflection of our family. In my experience, we learn to socialize through our families only and develop our intellect. From my own point of view, people who live with their families tend to be happier than ones living alone. Definitely, all the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from his family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which has made me a better person. For me, they are my first teachers and my first friends.. I will always be grateful to my family for all they have done for me. It seems to me that my life is empty without them. 1:____________________2:___________________3:___________________4:___________________5:___________________6;___________________7:_________________8:_________________9:_________________10:_________________​</a>
