                            16. Similarities between American and Japanese colonial era in the Philippines? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The colonization of the Philippines was actually the first attempt of America into trying their power as imperialists. In fact, the American congress even had laws against any attempt of invasion against other countries. And because of such by-laws, the military forces of America had to find loop-holes which will free them from any liabilities with accordance to the laws of invasion. After which they used the country (Philippines) as a strategic location into colonizing part of China which was actually their ultimate goal then. What happened is, at the start of the colonizing process of American, there was no land free of the influence of the first western colonizers. And because of this, they were left with what they called the “Chinese melon.” The Chinese melon was a term given to the country of China where most of the western imperialists had a share of, and American wanted to have a part in these shares, so they saw the Philippines as a good strategic location into helping them colonize parts of China.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>both colonizers used the same strategy which was to make the Filipinos feel as if they were not colonizers but the only difference was the time for them to implement their plans. Because of this the Filipinos saw the Americans better compared to that of the Japanese because during the American occupation there was no war unlike that of the Japanese occupation. And because of this, the Americans had time to “brain wash” the Filipinos because they had the time to cover their atrocities.</p><br />

                            17. Differentiate the literature during the Philippine pre-colonial era from the literatures in Spanish colonial era?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: During the Pre Colonial period, people didn’t have any religion or belief because before we were free. We had everything in our hands and we were free to do anything we wanted. We didn’t have anything ruling over us and dictating us what is needed to be done. And before, we can tell easily how people lived before. We weren’t ashamed of our lifestyle and we weren’t secretive about it. We were only starting to become civilized people. And this can be shown in the materials that our ancestors used. The materials that were available before were Bamboo, Nipa for the Highlands and Coconut Tree as a subtitute for bamboo and nipas or rattan for people living near the shores. In culture we know that Filipinos are known for having a strong bond within the family especially people who lives in Bahay kubo.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In terms of pre Spanish period, Spaniards spread Christianity as a technique in luring us and making their influence take over our beliefs thus our freedom. Nowadays it can still be seen how much impact the Spanish made in our beliefs that’s why today in the Philippines it is become the main religion. Because of that the first structure which they built was churches. Why? Because it started the community planning where in the churches is the center and the houses surrounding it because the church before was considered the most powerful.  Another is government, before priests were used as a symbol for power were in they are the ones who lead the people in to false religion and also used the people as their tools and taking advantage of their power. Other things Spaniards introduce were schools because they want to educate the people and teach them religion. In terms of materials it is also in these period were in stone were use in houses in other words they are the ones who introduced stone masonry and still using some native materials in their structures just like in Pre Colonial period. In this period houses consist of parts like living room, Bed room, Foyer, dining room and etc. unlike before during Pre colonial period they just have one big space.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Since 900 AD up to the present day we still follow some of these concepts and tradition in our daily life. Like in our structures today we see some concepts or influences that were use during Pre Spanish period like houses today we still use cement consisted of stones were in we know that stones were use during pre spanish. We also influence or get the concept the parts of houses that were use during pre spanish period like having living room,Bed room, Foyer, dining room and many more.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: Hope it helps :)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. What Are their common Characteristics.Japanese Literature and Philippine Literature.​</h2><br />
                         Answer;<p></p><p> </p>Japanese literature spans a period of almost two millennia and comprises one of the major literatures in the world, comparable to English literature in age and scope. Explanation;<p></p>It comprises a number of genres, including novels, poetry, and drama, travelogues, personal diaries and collections of random thoughts and impressions. <p></p>From the early seventh century until the present there has never been a period when literature was not being produced by Japanese authors.<p></p> Japan adopted its writing system from China, often using Chinese characters to represent Japanese words with similar phonetic sounds.<p></p> Early works were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China and Chinese literature, and was often written in Classical Chinese. <p></p>Though the Japanese writing system was adapted from Chinese, the two languages are unrelated. <p></p>The rich emotional vocabulary of the Japanese language gave rise to a refined sensitivity of expression, while Chinese was often used to write about more intellectual and abstract concepts such as morality and justice. <p></p>The nature of the spoken Japanese language, in which all words end with a simple vowel and stress accents do not exist, shaped the development of poetic forms which were relatively short in length and defined by the numbers of syllables in each line; and which sought above all for precise expression and rich literary allusion. <p></p>Official court patronage of poetry produced strict artistic codes which dictated the vocabulary and form which could be used for poetic expression.<p></p> Prose emphasized the smooth transition from one statement to another, rather than organization according to a formal theme.<p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>W</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>R</strong><br />

While some writers persisted in their work, the majority waited for a more favorable environment to publish their works.

The tight Japanese restrictions on any writing in English led Juan Laya, who previously wrote in English, to switch to writing in Filipino.It was said that the use of Tagalog was strengthened.<p></p><p></p><p><strong>Links for literature during the Japanese Occupation</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1585630</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10125673</p><p></p><p>#SPJ4</p><br />
