                        <p>impact of covid 19<strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>A WORLD ON PAUSE</strong><strong><br /><br /></strong>The COVID-19 epidemic has claimed many lives around the world and poses an unprecedented threat to public health, food systems, and the workplace. The pandemic's economic and social effects are devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, and the number of people who are undernourished, which is presently estimated at almost 690 million, might rise to 132 million by the end of the year.<br /><br />Millions of businesses are facing extinction. Almost half of the world's 3.3 billion workers are at danger of losing their jobs. Workers in the informal economy are particularly vulnerable because they lack social security and excellent health care, as well as having lost access to productive assets. Many people are unable to feed themselves and their family during lockdowns because they lack the means to make money. For most people, no money equals no food, or at the very least, less food that is less nutritious.<br /><br />The epidemic has had an impact on the entire food chain, exposing its vulnerability. Farmers and agricultural workers have been unable to access markets, including to acquire inputs and sell their goods, due to border closures, trade restrictions, and confinement measures, disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and limiting access to nutritious, safe, and diverse meals. The pandemic has wiped out jobs and put millions of people's lives in jeopardy. Millions of women and men's food security and nutrition are jeopardized as breadwinners lose jobs, grow ill, and die, with those in low-income nations, notably the most marginalized populations, such as small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being the hardest hit.<br /><br />While feeding the globe, millions of agricultural laborers, both salaried and self-employed, confront high levels of working poverty, malnutrition, and bad health, as well as a lack of safety and labor protection, as well as various forms of abuse. Because of their poor and irregular salaries and lack of social support, many of them are compelled to continue working, frequently in hazardous situations, putting themselves and their families at risk. Furthermore, when faced with a lack of income, individuals may turn to negative coping techniques such as asset distress sales, predatory lending, or child labor. Migrant agricultural laborers are particularly vulnerable because they confront dangers in their transportation, working, and living situations, as well as a lack of access to government-sponsored assistance. Providing higher wages and protection to all agri-food workers, from primary producers to those involved in food processing, transportation, and retail, including street food sellers, will be crucial to saving lives and maintaining public health, livelihoods, and food security.<br /><br />Food security, public health, and employment and labor issues, particularly worker health and safety, all intersect during the COVID-19 crisis. The human dimension of the problem will need adherence to workplace safety and health measures, as well as providing access to decent work and the protection of labor rights in all industries. Immediate and targeted action to save lives and livelihoods should include expanding social protection to encompass universal health coverage and economic assistance for the most vulnerable. Employees in the informal economy and in poorly protected and low-paying jobs, such as youth, elderly workers, and migrants, are among them. Women, who are over-represented in low-paying jobs and care duties, must be given special consideration. Cash transfers, child allowances, and healthy school lunches are all important, as are shelter and food assistance measures, support for job retention and recovery, and financial relief for businesses, especially micro, small, and medium-sized businesses. Governments must collaborate closely with employers and workers when formulating and implementing such policies.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 has a particularly negative impact on countries dealing with humanitarian crises or emergencies. It's vital to respond quickly to the pandemic while also ensuring that humanitarian and rehabilitation aid reaches those who need it most.<br /><br />Now is the time for global solidarity and assistance, particularly for the most vulnerable members of our societies, especially in rising and developing countries. Only by working together can we overcome the pandemic's linked health, social, and economic effects and prevent it from escalating into a long-term humanitarian and food security disaster, potentially wiping out already made development gains.<br /><br />As the United Nations Secretary-General stated in his Policy Brief, we must recognize this chance to rebuild better. We are committed to combining our knowledge and experience to assist countries in developing disaster response plans and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. <br /><br /><strong>(continueation of this essay is on the comments since theres a word limit)</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ABOUT nine months from now, President Rodrigo Duterte could get vaccinated against this coronavirus that has altered how we live and work this year. That is not certain. It’s merely what the presidential spokesman, Harry Roque, announced last week.</p><p></p><p>He also revealed, according to the same Deutsche Welle report, that Phase 3 clinical trials may take place in the country from October 2020 to March 2021 for the vaccine candidate that’s been named Sputnik V. At that stage of the vaccine development process, thousands of people are given the vaccine candidate to confirm that it is both safe and effective.</p><p></p><p>Health authorities in the Philippines have yet to reveal what criteria they will use to pick who will get to test Russia’s vaccine and where one can sign up. I’m curious to see how the health department will handle the public awareness and persuasion components of this process. Our latest experience with a new vaccine didn’t go so well, if you’ll recall.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Responses of subnational government units are crucial in the containment of the spread of pathogens in a country. To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine national government through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases outlined different quarantine measures wherein each level has a corresponding degree of rigidity from keeping only the essential businesses open to allowing all establishments to operate at a certain capacity. Other measures also involve prohibiting individuals at a certain age bracket from going outside of their homes. The local government units (LG Us)–municipalities and provinces–can adopt any of these measures depending on the extent of the pandemic in their locality. The purpose is to keep the number of infections and mortality at bay while minimizing the economic impact of the pandemic. Some LG Us have demonstrated a remarkable response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to identify notable non-pharmaceutical interventions of these outlying LG Us in the country using quantitative methods.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Based on my research </p><p></p><br />

However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 is a pandemic. Billions of people are being affected and millions of people are being infected. We can’t go outside and play, school is closed and we can’t visit family and friends. The novel coronavirus has caused many loved ones to be mourned and missed. But is it as bad as it seems? Covid-19 has also caused some very good things to happen. Like a healing earth, new technology, and community engagement.</p><p></p><p>Upon the recent worldwide quarantines and lockdowns, we have collectively significantly cut down on emissions. These cutbacks are helping the ozone layer recover faster then us humans would have been able to do. That is if we were going to do anything in the first place. Anyways, the ozone layer isn’t the only part of this beautiful world we live in that’s getting better. Our oceans, rivers, and lakes they are becoming cleaner and more suitable for ocean life. Hopefully the ocean life will have a baby boom and be the start of helping the natural order of life be restored. If the natural order of life be restored it would mean that many endangered species, like polar bears, tigers, pandas, and rhinos will no longer be endangered as well as the hundreds of other endangered animals.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 has caused many people to be anxious, stressed, lonely and possibly depressed. That’s why many companies are taking the lead in creating new apps and websites for people to go to and perhaps relieve themselves for any stresses and anxieties. Other companies and people are helping out governments to help the critically ill COVID-19 patients. In Singapore, the government had help from local tech companies to launch an app called TraceTogether. The app uses Bluetooth signals between smartphones to see if potential carriers of COVID-19 have been in close contact with other people. Thanks to these types of inventions, some countries have been able to slow down the rate of infection and focus on finding a cure.</p><p></p><p>There are countless stories of good people offering to pick up groceries or help with other tasks for neighbours — and even strangers — who are unable to leave their homes. This is one example of how many communities are coming together to help those who are more vulnerable in this emergency. Despite quarantines and social distancing, connections are still being made all around the world. During the lockdown in Italy, some of those quarantined are lifting their spirits and others through music or dance, another wonderful piece of evidence that communities are coming together to become one. To help people stay connected through this self-isolation period, some musicians and bands are offering free concerts online.</p><p></p><p>I think that if people keep doing these acts of kindness, governments across the world will see these types of actions and hopefully the world will come together as one and live in peace and happiness.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is scary. We should all be cautious and try to stay home as much as we can, and keep our distance when we must go outside. The novel coronavirus is an evolving situation and has caused sad things to happen like death and illness. We should not denote the severity of the situation, but we should remember that COVID-19 has caused some very good things to happen to us. Like a healing earth, new technology and community engagement.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer: The government has recently launched the "Social Amelioration Package" (SAP) as part of its response to the COVID-19 crisis. According to the Joint Memorandum on SAP, the aim of government’s social amelioration measures is to “mitigate the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 health crisis and the Enhanced Community Quarantine guidelines.” </p><p>Several government agencies were tasked to implement SAP, with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) at the head. The government’s social amelioration shall include support to 18 million Filipinos who will be most affected by COVID-19. The target beneficiaries are senior citizens, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, solo parents, OFWs (distress at repatriated), indigenous people, homeless, farmers, fisherfolks, self-employed, informal settlers, and those under No Work-No Pay arrangements (e.g., drivers, househelp, construction workers, etc.). </p><p>The target beneficiaries of SAP shall receive cash and in-kind assistance amounting to P5,000-8,000 per month for two months. This shall not be on top of existing social programs. So for instance, what the beneficiaries of Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) are receiving will form part of the P5,000-8,000, which will be augmented through other programs under the SAP. </p><p>There are 3 challenges in the SAP that, if addressed, could help ensure that the program succeeds in helping Filipinos in distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><br />

COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19.

                            19. Write a 5 Paragraph Expository Essay about Coronavirus Disease (COVID 19.)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to become a global pandemic, affecting millions of people worldwide. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching one's mouth, nose, or eyes. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and loss of taste or smell.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest challenges with COVID-19 is its highly contagious nature. The virus spreads easily from person to person, and individuals can be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus. This makes it difficult to control the spread of the virus, and it has resulted in many people contracting the virus without even realizing it. The best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing, wear a mask, wash your hands frequently, and avoid large gatherings.</p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy. Businesses have been forced to shut down, resulting in massive job losses and financial instability for many individuals and families. Governments around the world have implemented stimulus packages and other measures to help alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic. However, it will likely take years for the global economy to fully recover from the effects of COVID-19.</p><p></p><p>Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the scientific community has come together to develop effective vaccines against COVID-19. Multiple vaccines have been developed and approved for emergency use around the world. These vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. Vaccination campaigns are underway in many countries, with the goal of achieving herd immunity and ending the pandemic.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory illness that has had a significant impact on the world. The pandemic has challenged individuals, businesses, and governments in ways that were previously unimaginable. However, the scientific community has risen to the challenge and developed effective vaccines against COVID-19. With continued vigilance and adherence to public health guidelines, we can work together to overcome the pandemic and return to a sense of normalcy.</p><br />

These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.</p><p>You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe economic and social impacts around the world. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the disruptions the pandemic has caused, and many are now at risk of being left behind in education, economic opportunities, and health and wellbeing during a crucial stage of their life development. Young people are more likely to be unemployed or to be in precarious job contracts and working arrangements, and thus, lack adequate social protection. At the same time, young people are responding to the crisis through public health promotion, volunteering and innovation. Young people will form a key element in an inclusive recovery and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) during this Decade of Action. However, the response and recovery must be done in a way that protects the human rights of all youth.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on all our lives. While we are each doing our part of prevent the spread, and while frontline healthcare workers risk their lives to care for the sick, researchers are racing to find the one thing that will protect all of us in the long run a vaccine.
</p><p>
</p><p>The vaccine will become the currency of life and death. Nearly every person on the planet will need it to stay safe from the virus. Ensuring everyone has access is the only way to protect us all from another COVID-19 pandemic.
</p><p>
</p><p>The greatest challenge is ensuring everyone on the planet gets the vaccine as quickly as possible and free of charge.
</p><p>
</p><p>What’s at risk? That the richest will be allowed to buy themselves protection, while the rest of us and particularly women, girls and the poorest get pushed to the back of the line.
</p><p>
</p><p>It doesn’t have to be this way.  </p><p>
</p><p>We can demand a commitment from world leaders to guarantee NOW that the vaccine will be free and fairly distributed to everyone on the planet.
</p><p>
</p><p>Tell world leaders that we cannot put a price on global immunity, sign the petition now. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>MARK ME BRAINLIEST PLSSSS</p><br />
