                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Education is basically a process of transferring knowledge. When a kid starts going to kinder-garden, he or she starts leaning basics of education and start getting knowledge. This process keeps going for so many years and varies on the basis of educational system of that particular place. It makes you think about the science behind everything happening around yourself and many other things like language, literature and mathematics etc. Don’t consider education as writing exams and getting degrees. Take it as a opportunity to learn that you wouldn’t get easily. That’s why we say that basic education is important for everyone. So, whenever you are getting chance to get some knowledge, whether in school, college or somewhere else, just try to learn things if you are interested in it.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>True Friendship</p><p>A person is acquainted with many persons in their life. However, the closest ones become our friends. You may have a large friend circle in school or college, but you know you can only count on one or two people with whom you share true friendship.</p><p></p><p>There are essentially two types of friends, one is good friends the other are true friends or best friends. They’re the ones with whom we have a special bond of love and affection. In other words, having a true friend makes our lives easier and full of happiness.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, true friendship stands for a relationship free of any judgments. In a true friendship, a person can be themselves completely without the fear of being judged. It makes you feel loved and accepted. This kind of freedom is what every human strives to have in their lives.</p><p></p><p>In short, true friendship is what gives us reason to stay strong in life. Having a loving family and all is okay but you also need true friendship to be completely happy. Some people don’t even have families but they have friends who’re like their family only. Thus, we see having true friends means a lot to everyone.</p><p></p><p>ance of Friendship</p><p>Friendship is important in life because it teaches us a great deal about life. We learn so many lessons from friendship which we won’t find anywhere else. You learn to love someone other than your family. You know how to be yourself in front of friends.</p><p></p><p>Friendship never leaves us in bad times. You learn how to understand people and trust others. Your real friends will always motivate you and cheer for you. They will take you on the right path and save you from any evel.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, friendship also teaches you a lot about loyalty. It helps us to become loyal and get loyalty in return. There is no greater feeling in the world than having a friend who is loyal to you.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Friendship is one of the most powerful bonds of two people in this world. Someone who is a true friend stands up for you. When others try to hurt you emotionally or physically, they do everything they can to make sure you stay safe. They don't care who is trying to harm you; they will defend you anytime, anywhere. A friend is one who admires a person's skill and helps or encourages them to make the right choices and do not get into any trouble at all. The strength of the bond of friendship between two people can vary. If the bond is very strong, they are called best friends. Real friend are faithful, generous, honest, humorous, loving, forgiving, and many other good traits. True friends never leave you behind no matter what the situation is you're in. They will gladly help you with everything you need.  Among the traits of a best friend, honesty is easily one of the most significant.  Great friends are accepting, even when their lives diverge from your own. Also friends must be loyal and they must not stab you in the back with bad word about you.  A loyal friend supports you all the time, no matter what. Real friends come through for you when the going gets tough. They comfort you when you're in pain, listen to you vent when you're frustrated, and will usually do you a favor when you really need one. A friend is someone you should be able to call when you really need to be bailed out of a bad situation. Forever friends are rare gems. They come few and far between as the years pass. They're priceless. This popular study says it all: If a friendship lasts longer than seven years, psychologists say it will last a lifetime.</p><p>I hope this is enough. </p><p>#CARRYONEARNING</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:“No element is more essential to life than carbon,” says the book Nature’s Building Blocks. The unique characteristics of carbon enable it to bond with itself and many other chemical elements, thus forming millions of compounds, more of which are constantly being discovered or synthesized.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As the examples here show, carbon atoms can also combine to form various shapes, including chains, pyramids, rings, sheets, and tubes. Carbon truly is a wonder element!</strong></p><p></p><p>DIAMOND
</p><p>
</p><p>A diamond
</p><p>Carbon atoms form pyramids, called tetrahedrons, making the structure extremely rigid and making diamond the hardest naturally occurring substance known. A perfect diamond is essentially a single molecule of carbon atoms.</p><p></p><p>GRAPHITE
</p><p>
</p><p>A lead pencil
</p><p>Tightly bonded carbon atoms are set out in loosely bonded layers that can slide away from one another like sheets of paper on a stack. Because of these characteristics, graphite is both a fine lubricant and a key compound in lead pencils. </p><p></p><p>GRAPHENE
</p><p>
</p><p>A pencil trace
</p><p>This refers to a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal mesh, or lattice. Graphene has a tensile strength many times that of steel. A pencil trace may have small amounts of graphene in single or multiple layers.</p><p></p><br />

                            9. what is art? essay 150 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Art is an expression of life, which means it expresses emotions. Creation that allows for interpretation of any kind is art. I have read somewhere that art is a human skill as opposed to nature, a skill applied to music, painting, poetry etc. I believe that nature is art as well. If something is made a certain way, then it's unique in its own way.</p><p>        Artists will use their form of artwork to pass along their views and feelings. Their importance and value to society has remained the same throughout history. The images that they produce may express an innovative way of seeing the world or society around us. Interpreting art depends on a person experiences, their visionary thoughts, culture, and associations. Art is like love in that there are so many definitions and examples for each. Therefore, I believe art is not perfection; art is something that continues to develop as it is seen, meaning to open all human capacities, thoughts and emotions. Art is a creation that lets observer interpret the art any way they see it and the artists to portray their art in whatever way they want whether it is viewed the same way as the observer or not.</p><br />

There are also many ways that the two styles can cross over each other; this is seen in popular music and a lot of video game music. Though many people cannot see any similarities between modern and classical music, modern music is really an evolution of classical music; the roots of modern music go back to classical era. The term “classical music” refers to the western influence, not the eastern influence of Asia; the two are very different…show more content…</p><p></p><p>One of the greatest composers of music, even though it was only slightly notated at the time, was Guillaume de Machaut (d. 1377), “one of the undisputed pinnacle geniuses of Western music…” His most famous piece was the four-voice Mass of Notre Dame, which maintained his reputation through the changes in fashion (Roberge). After almost a millennium’s worth of music was composed and contributed, the style of music began to change with the next era. From 1400 to 1600 A.D., the Renaissance was a period of a rediscovery of Greek ideals for musicians to explore possibilities of their art. It was during this time that ideas were able to better circulate, because individualism began to increase, and the printing of music helped to preserve and distribute musical ideas (History). Also, as opposed to the medieval period, the Renaissance began to expand upon the type of sound that was created by adding the voices of women in choirs, as well as expanding instrumental music. The texture of music also began to change, with homophonic and polyphonic compositions. Sacred vocal polyphony was used rather than monophony in the form of masses and motets, while secular pieces also included madrigals and songs. Instrumental pieces usually were short during this time, and were for dancing (History).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

This activity takes off a lot of time, and sometimes imagination just doesn’t work in your favor. That’s where our list of best research paper topics will come in handy.
</p><p>
</p><p>We collected the most unhacked and powerful ideas to turn the average piece of writing into a research paper. Discover what is a research paper and how to choose suitable and interesting research topics with our help.  </p><p>
</p><p>Writing a research topic on your own requires either producing one from scratch (based on your interests and goals and potentially, on some brainstorming) or getting inspiration from a number of sources, like preassembled topic lists, course material, teachers, real life, news headlines, published research in the respective field, etc.If you are confused with a variety of interesting topics for writing a creative essay, it’s better to decide what interests you the most. Don’t stick to easy research paper topics just to complete the task fast. If you are allowed to freely choose what to write an essay about, use the opportunity to create something unique. Write down the list of your interests and break down every idea into small certain topics. When you have a list in front of your eyes, it will be easier to make up your mind and start considering a particular issue.

Use pros/cons template to include all the arguments and objections to the issues.If a topic is a backbone of your paper, then information is its essential body element. Before settling on the research topic ideas, you have to make sure there is enough information for you to model the main body of your paper. It is recommended to use textbooks (both online and offline), articles and other sources that deal with scientific explanations and review your topic from the most debatable side. Especially if you decided to stop on controversial topics for research papers, you should prepare in advance and look up for the strong arguments to support your thesis.Before formulating your research question, note that there are 3 important types of research questions:
</p><p>
</p><p>descriptive – these employ careful and comprehensive observation of a phenomenon/ event, subject, trait, etc. in order to characterize it in detail and to potentially reveal important/ interesting/ undescribed aspects or patterns.
</p><p>causal – these investigate whether altering some variables leads to changes in other variables suggesting a causal relationship.
</p><p>comparative – these look into similarities and differences between two or more entities.What is a Good Research Paper Topic?
</p><p>Features that tend to characterize good research questions are as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>specific and concrete – investigation goals and (expected results) have to be clear and focused
</p><p>original – investigating aspects/ entities/ relationships that have not been researched before
</p><p>highly important/impactful for community/ society/ a professional field.
</p><p>highly relevant for potential readers/ reviewers
</p><p>trending – emerging disciplines/ topics spark more interest due to their novelty and yet unexplored potential</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE<p></p><p>Introducing a new concept of work practice to an organization means changes have to occur in order to accommodate it. This would lead to organizational changes and may disrupt work patterns. Often, a change is necessary if an organization means to be competitive, and unless new ways and methods are developed and introduced, an organization may find itself lagging and not competitive. Benchmarking is one of those concepts that aim to improve work practices and achieve optimum results. Because change can bring negative connotations, it is important to take careful steps to effect change without major disruption to employees who would, more likely, be resistant to a new concept that may threaten their work comfort zone. There are many factors that have to be considered prior to implementation of change in an organization, in this case a hospital. Employees in an organization, such as a hospital, are likely to resist changes. So it is inevitable that some obstacles will appear when benchmarking is introduced. The resistance to change is often generated by the lack of understanding of the proposed change, so, providing training to people affected by the change would help reduce their resistance and make the change more acceptable. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>RAINEST </strong><strong>AND </strong><strong>HEART </strong><strong>PLEASE</strong></p><br />

                        Many countries believe that propaganda helps to institute a necessary level of patriotism in their citizens. Most authoritarian governments, the type of government that Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell illustrates, use propaganda. However, the use of propaganda also limits the freedom of people since propaganda can control thought and speech. Propaganda can influence people to believe that their country is the best country by either exaggerating the positive events that are happening in their country or by showing negative events that are happening in other countries. Nineteen Eighty-Four is more about the dangers of the government controlling people’s thoughts by propaganda than the dangers of an authoritarian government system. The belief that a government is always watching their citizens can control people’s thoughts and propaganda can help to establish this belief. The leader of a totalitarian government is often “omnipresent, all-knowing, larger than life and half-divine” (Roelofs 4). An omnipresent leader can institute an extreme level of obedience into the citizens of their country because the citizens may conclude that the government could determine if the citizens support most of the government’s actions by analyzing videos or other visual evidence collected by the government. <br />
