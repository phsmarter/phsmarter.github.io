</p><p>My mom talks to me about many things. One of the things she talks to me about is what will happen when I grow up. She tells me what to do in case of an emergency. And one day I had a really bad day with my friends, and she told me what to do about it.
</p><p>My mom and I spend a lot of time together. We play games, bake cookies, make necklaces, and draw doodle tricks. But our favorite thing to do is read. Our favorite book is If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.</p><p>Mom takes me shopping at the mall. We buy toys and clothes, and we eat at the café. We usually get Chinese food or go to a McDonald’s restaurant. When we ride the escalator, my mom pretends to fall back and says, “My shoestring’s stuck!”
</p><p>My mom always laughs, and when she laughs she sounds like a hyena gone crazy! She doesn’t laugh every day, but when she does, it’s hilarious, and I have to laugh, too!</p><p>My mom is the greatest. I love how she jokes around. She is always fun no matter what, and she gives me great advice. My mom is more than a mom; she is like my best friend!</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Answer:<p>Mother nature is important, she is essential for us to live. We should always be grateful for living in such a wonderful world. Make sure to make her feel appreciated by taking care of her. It pains me to think that some humans take advantage of the resources and overuse them. They are destroying nature. They won't listen to the complaints. We should make sure that they hear our voices, speak out don't stay silent. Being silent will only bring more harm. Staying neutral when Mother nature is calling for help is very selfish of you. Without her we would perish and suffer the consequences. We need to do everything we can to make her safe from the greedy people.</p>#CarryOnLearning<br />

                        Pandemic (Descriptive Essay):<p></p><p>The pandemic that rocked the world in the year 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging periods in human history. It started as a small outbreak in Wuhan, China and quickly spread to different parts of the world, resulting in mass infections and fatalities. The pandemic forced governments to declare nationwide lockdowns, causing disruptions in all aspects of life, including the economy, social life, and education.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic changed people’s daily lives in unprecedented ways. People were forced to wear masks and keep social distancing measures. Suddenly, the routine activities people took for granted, such as going to the office, attending classes, traveling, and socializing with friends, were threatened, if not entirely impossible. The pandemic cast a shadow of fear and uncertainty over everyone, causing panic and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>As schools and businesses were forced to shut down, people had to adapt to new ways of learning and working. Virtual communication became the norm, with video conferencing and online communication platforms taking the place of face-to-face interactions. However, this led to new challenges, such as internet connectivity issues and privacy concerns.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic also had significant economic impacts, with several businesses and industries grinding to a halt, resulting in layoffs and unemployment. Some small businesses closed their doors entirely, making it difficult for many people to keep their livelihoods. While some people could work remotely, others had to take up essential roles, such as doctors, nurses, and first responders, exposing themselves to the virus and risking their lives to keep others safe.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the pandemic presented significant challenges on a global scale. While the world is still grappling with the effects of the virus, the pandemic has taught us to prioritize our health and rethink our approaches to work, education, and socialization. Although it was a difficult time, it also brought people closer, and we saw communities coming together to support each other.</p><p></p><p><strong>Please </strong><strong>trust </strong><strong>me,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>haven’</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>copy </strong><strong>on </strong><strong>Google,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>just </strong><strong>answer </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>my </strong><strong>own.</strong></p><p>In the 21st century, it seems like the world is constantly on edge, waiting for the next disaster to strike. From natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes to human-made crises like wars and political uprisings, the world has seen it all. Yet there is one crisis that has transcended all others in its global reach and long-lasting effects: the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It all began in late 2019, when the mysterious and highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified in China. At first, it seemed like an isolated outbreak that would be quickly contained and disappear into the fringes of history. But within a few weeks, it became clear that this was no ordinary epidemic. As the virus spread across the globe, it infected millions of people, overwhelming healthcare systems and leaving many countries desperately scrambling to find a way to stop the spread.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the early days of the pandemic, there was a sense of disbelief and fear. People were unsure about what this new virus could do, and there were many questions that remained unanswered. Scientists worked tirelessly to learn more about the virus and develop treatments and vaccines, but the uncertainty and fear of the unknown remained.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Despite the best efforts of healthcare professionals and governments, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on people and communities across the world. It has claimed the lives of millions of people, and many more have suffered from long-term health effects. The pandemic has also had a significant impact on the global economy, with many businesses forced to close their doors and millions of people becoming unemployed or under-employed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But even in the darkest days of the pandemic, there was a sense of hope. As scientists worked on developing vaccines, it became clear that there was a light at the end of the tunnel. And when the first effective vaccines became available, it was like a beacon of hope for the world.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is clear that the world will never be the same. The COVID-19 virus has left an indelible mark on humanity and has changed the way we live and work. But even in the midst of this crisis, there have been heroes who have risen up to face the challenge and have given us hope for a better future.<br /><strong><br /><br /><br />Happy learning!

                        I dont really get the question but what I'm writing is about a persuasive essay for the teenagers to think twice before everything's ruin in order for them to not experience being a teenage mother.<br /><br />As a girl, it is really dangerous to be "too showy" and/or "too expressing" to one's feelings for another. Our emotions are really too sensitive and can easily be swayed away by a guy's so-called sweet acts and gestures making us enter to a relationship wherein we have no idea what's it really like except for "loving one another". But is that really all in a relationship?<br /><br />Guys that are not serious about you will eventually transformed the word "love" to "lust". They don't and won't care at all about our feelings and such rather, only care for the looks and figure we have right now. And yet why do many girls fall for such an act? One thing I have observed is that girls are desperate and are "too curious" as to what being in a relationship means. That's why they just go for it even when they knew the worst possible consequences expecially if being a teenage girl.<br /><br />Being a teenage mom, even when I just look from afar, is very difficult and tiring for those who have gone through such. And in the end, the girls would regret. As young as you are right now, try not to be involve in relationships that involve easy-going guys that only care simply for their desires. Act like a lady yet think like a boss. Do not be driven by your curiosity too because eventually someday your turn would be next in the perfect moment. And if you're a teenage mom, then whatever you do, you should think of your baby as your topmost priority. Even if you made a mistake, make sure to not let your son/daughter make the same mistake again. <br /><br />Be a good role model for them to follow and try your best in order to counteract life. Have determination and hard work to achieve the things you want to achieve for both of you. You shouldnt give up even when people or even your loved ones would discouraged you because for one, even when they think of you, you know what's best for yourself. And in everything you do, if your a believer in Christ, then have faith. Surely, God would guide you.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I was just six years old when my parents got divorced. When I tell people this, they are inclined to look at me with a melancholic expression and pity, but I always put a halt to it. I tell them that I was one of the fortunate few. My parents were civil to each other and my childhood was pretty decent.</p><p>I never considered either of my parents to be a single parent. Despite their divorce, they looked after me in unison. My time was divided amongst both of them. Half of the year, I resided at my father’s residence and the other half at my mother’s apartment. Their houses were just a ten minute drive from each other so I was never far away from either of them. Every Saturday night, we would have dinner together and there was no hostility. My parents were always present together to celebrate my birthdays, special festivals like Eid and important moments of my life like volleyball final matches, graduations and the list goes on. Even though, they were divorced, I had a functional life. </p><p>It seemed like my parents had figured out how to be divorced and still make sure I was not scarred by it. I had believed that I had been untouched by the horrible…show more content…</p><p>There have been many moments when instead of aiming to better my relationship with my husband, I was just avoiding conflict because deep inside, I believe conflict will eventually lead to divorce. The other day, my husband decided to invest our money from the joint account in a new construction venture even though I had told him not to. When I asked him about it, he listed the reasons as to why he believed strongly in the venture and could not let me make a mistake. After arguing a bit more, I stopped and said, “I guess you are right” with a big sigh. </p><br />

                        <strong>ESSAY ABOUT POLLUTION </strong><p></p><p>Pollution is a serious issue that affects our environment and our health. It is caused by various human activities such as transportation, industrial processes, and waste disposal. The effects of pollution can be seen in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Pollution can cause respiratory problems, cancer, and other health issues.</p><p></p><p>One of the main causes of pollution is transportation. Cars, buses, and trucks emit harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. These gases can cause respiratory problems and contribute to climate change. Industrial processes also contribute to pollution by releasing toxic chemicals into the air and water. Waste disposal is another major source of pollution. Landfills and incinerators release harmful chemicals into the environment, which can contaminate the soil and water.</p><p></p><p>To address the issue of pollution, we must take action to reduce our carbon footprint. This can be done by using public transportation, carpooling, and walking or biking instead of driving. We can also reduce pollution by using renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Recycling and proper waste disposal can also help to reduce pollution. By taking these steps, we can help to protect our environment and our health.</p><br />
