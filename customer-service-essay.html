                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The most important rule in providing excellent customer service is to be friendly. Try to greet customers with a smile and always be courteous and respectful. Another factor in good customer service involves the timeliness of your responses. Customers appreciate a speedy response to their inquiries, especially when they have a time-sensitive request. To offer your customers excellent service, you should know every aspect of the product or service you are selling. Listening is one of the simplest ways to provide excellent customer service. Sometimes customers just need to be heard, so be sure to actively listen to what they have to say. A simple “thank you” can go a long way when providing customer service. Customers often remember sincere gratitude, and it reminds them why they hired your company or shopped at your store. Providing great customer service means knowing who your customers are and what they want. Asking your customers for feedback shows them you care about their opinion and want to be helpful. Allowing them to provide feedback can make them feel appreciated.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Click The Link</p><p></p><br />

                            15. Case study The photocopying businessis thriving in Dagupan City. Miss josefina "Fina" Datu is the owner and operatorof the biggest copying firm in the city. Fina has been in the business for more than 20 years and because of her courage and enterprise, she was able to put up 3 branches in each of the capital towns of 3 adjoining provinces, namely Nueva ecija, Tarlac and Pangasinan . She is planning to operate in nueva vizcaya and isabela in the near future. The business involves using machine to copy documents, books, magazine and other material. Fina employs 6 young ladies per branch. A big dealer in manila supplies her with the latest copying machine, paper and ink. Fina has open credit line with the dealer. Fina personally trains new employees in the firm's main office in Dagupan. After a month of training, the new employees are deployed in various branches. New employees are paid daily wages depending on output . They are also entitled to free board and lodging . The firm's customer consist of teachers,students, government employees and some others. Just a week ago, the dean of a big school in the city propose to her the copying of books to be sold to students. The dean indicate tht she will take care of selling the books to students in her School. For the service, the dean was expecting a 20 percent commission. Fina thinks the proposal is a good one and it will yield good profits. Shes not yet fully convince, however, is the proposal is ethically right . Fina considera seeking the advice of someone who should be informing her about the right thing to do before she makes a decision.Guide Question:If you were consulted by Fina, what would you advice her ?  why?NOTE : ESSAY TYPE ANSWER​</h2><br />
                        <p>If Fina consulted me about the ethical implications of the dean's proposal to copy books for students, my advice would be to carefully consider the potential consequences of this decision.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Fina needs to review any legal implications of copying and selling books, especially if there are any copyright or intellectual property rights involved. She needs to make sure that she is not violating any laws and regulations by taking on this project.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Fina needs to consider the impact of this decision on her reputation and that of her business. Copying and selling books to students may be viewed as unethical by some people, especially if it is perceived as taking advantage of students who are already struggling financially. This may lead to negative publicity, loss of customers, and ultimately, damage to her business.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, Fina should assess the financial implications of this proposal. While the proposal may generate significant profits, it may also require additional investment in equipment, labor, and other resources. She needs to ensure that the profits outweigh the costs and that the investment is worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Fina should evaluate the long-term consequences of this decision. Is this proposal in line with her business goals and values? Will it create sustainable growth and opportunities for her business? Will it align with the interests and needs of her customers?</p><br />
