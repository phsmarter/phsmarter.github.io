How will you describe a healthy person?
If your answer in the previous activity described a healthy person as having a fit body, then you are
only looking at health in one dimension. People often frame the concept of health by looking at a
person's physical body-having the right weight, smooth and moisturized skin, shiny hair, clean
fingernail and toenails, and other descriptions of one's physical state. Little do people know that
health is beyond the physical body.</a>
