                        <p><strong> </strong>The saying “you are what you eat” rings true when it comes to maintaining good digestive health. Our digestive system is responsible for breaking down the food we eat, extracting nutrients, and eliminating waste. Eating a nutrient-rich and balanced diet is essential for keeping the digestive system functioning properly.</p><p></p><p>When we consume a diet high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats, we put our digestive health at risk. Nutrient deficiencies can occur, leading to various diseases and health problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colon cancer.</p><p></p><p>For example, individuals who lack fiber in their diets may experience constipation and other digestive issues. Those deficient in vitamins and minerals such as iron and magnesium may experience fatigue and weakness. An inadequate intake of vitamins A and D can lead to vision problems and weakened bones.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is crucial to consume a well-balanced diet rich in nutrients in order to maintain good digestive health. Our bodies rely on the nutrients we consume to function properly, and a diet lacking in essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber can lead to various diseases and health problems. Remember, “you are what you eat,” so make sure to nourish your body with healthy and wholesome foods.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

It can also cause severe side effects or complications in people with certain health conditions.</p><p></p><p>You should always talk to your doctor before going on a fast. They can advise you on your individual benefits and risks.                           You’ll be well into your 24-hour period before your body realizes that you’re fasting.</p><p></p><p>During the first eight hours, your body will continue to digest your last intake of food. Your body will use stored glucose as energy and continue to function as though you’ll be eating again soon.</p><p></p><p>After eight hours without eating, your body will begin to use stored fats for energy. Your body will continue to use stored fat to create energy throughout the remainder of your 24-hour fast.</p><p></p><p>Fasts that last longer than 24 hours may lead to your body to start converting stored proteins into energy.</p><br />

                            27. (Essay) What can you say about those eating disorders?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>An eating disorder is an illness that involves an unhealthy feeling about the food we eat. “Eating disorders affect 5-10 millions Americans and 70 million individuals worldwide” They also affect many people from women, men, children, from all ages and different races. People who have eating disorders usually see themselves as being fat when they really aren’t. This usually deals with women or teenage girls mostly. They watch television, movies, read articles in magazines, and see pictures of the celebrities whom they want to be like because they have the “ideal body” that everyone wants and craves for. The media makes us all think we need those types of bodies to be happy with ourselves, be more successful.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainliest :))</p><br />

                        <p>Below is a pdf link to personal statements and application essays representing strong efforts by students applying for both undergraduate and graduate opportunities. These ten essays have one thing in common: They were all written by students under the constraint of the essay being 1-2 pages due to the target program’s explicit instructions. In such circumstances, writers must attend carefully to the essay prompt (sometimes as simple as “Write a one-page summary of your reasons for wanting to pursue graduate study”) and recognize that evaluators tend to judge these essays on the same fundamental principles, as follows:</p><p>First, you are typically expected to provide a window into your personal motivations, offer a summary of your field, your research, or your background, set some long-term goals, and note specific interest in the program to which you are applying.</p><br />

                        <p>When hunger strikes, often you eat with your eyes, because the first thing that is visible to you becomes just what you want.

It may not be the best item to satisfy hunger, but it is what you grab.There is a fine line between eating and overeating. Eating is enjoying food, overeating is when you no longer taste the food yet you continue eating. This could happen for many reasons. Overeating often happens when your focus is on other thoughts, emotions, or actions as you continue eating. Eating is then mindless. Eating enjoyment happens when you break from conversation.</p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong> </strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
