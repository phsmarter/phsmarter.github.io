                        <p>I choose to teach because I love to meet people and share some knowledge that I have mastered or even share some basic skills with them.</p><p></p><p><strong>Further explanation :</strong></p><p></p><p>A teacher is a professional job that mainly teaches students based on the curriculum in their respective specialist subject. It can be distinguished into 2 types, formal and informal education. Teaching can be done between those 2. It is not always about formal education. Basically, the teachers’ job is to teach students about the basics, give them explanations about the subject, sign some homework and also keep track of their progress. Teaching seems to be easy, but in reality, being a teacher is hard. You need to make sure that your personal life won’t cause problems with the job.</p><p></p><p>Other than teaching the students about the subject, teaching also about creating a safe and fun environment for the kids, it will help them enjoy other things, and also keeping  a good relationship and communication with the student, so if they need anything they won’t be scared to approach the teacher.</p><p></p><p>When you decided to be a teacher, you need to master some skills, such as :</p>Communication: communication is such a huge deal in teaching, if you don't have this skill, then it will be pretty hard to deliver the subject and build such a nice communication with the students.Patience: kids have their own level of understanding, there are fast learners and slow learners. So you need some patience here in order for them to understand the materialsCreativity: people tend to be bored if there is no something fun during studying, thus you need to be creative to make such a good vibe to keep them entertain and enjoy the process of learningEnthusiasm: if we show up to teach with no enthusiasm, it could affect others and make the situation awkward, thus we need to have enthusiasm.Confidence: a lot of teaching requires public speaking, and people will pay you respect if you speak with confidence.<p></p><p>Therefore the reason why I choose teaching is that I also can learn some stuff by teaching and get to meet a lot of people and share my knowledge with them</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about teaching</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/14563620</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17329450</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ5</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p></p><p>ICT have become commonplace entities in all aspects of life.  Across  the  past  twenty  years  the  use of  ICT  has  fundamentally  transformed  the practices  and  procedures  of  nearly  all  forms of exertion within business and governance. Education is a very socially focused activity and quality education has traditionally been connected with strong teachers having high degrees of personal contact with learners. The use of ICT in education lends itself to more student-centred learning settings.  But  with  the  world moving  swiftly  into  digital  media  and  information,  the  role  of  ICT  in  education  is  becoming more  and  more  essential  and  this  importance  will  continue  to  grow  and  develop  in  the  21st century.</p><p></p><p>Introduction Digital Era is also known as ‘Information Age’, or ‘New Media Age’.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Financial literacy is an important life skill that teaches individuals how to manage their money and make informed financial decisions. Financial literacy has become increasingly important in today’s world, and it is important to teach children the basics of financial literacy early on. By doing so, children can gain the skills necessary to understand the concept of money and how to use it responsibly.</p><p></p><p>The first step in teaching financial literacy to children is to provide them with basic information about money. This can include teaching them about the different coin and bill denominations, how to count money, and how to make change. Additionally, children should be taught the concept of saving money and budgeting. This can include teaching them the importance of setting aside money for savings and creating a budget for their spending.</p><p></p><p>In addition to teaching children the basics of financial literacy, it is important to discuss the concept of credit and debt. Children should be taught the importance of not taking on debt they cannot afford and the consequences of not being able to pay back borrowed money. Teaching children the importance of having a good credit score and how to maintain it can also be beneficial in helping them understand how to properly manage their finances.</p><p></p><p>Finally, children should be taught the importance of investing money. Teaching children about the concept of investing and how to properly diversify their investments can help them understand the importance of planning for their financial future. Children should also be taught about the different types of investments and the risks associated with each one.</p><p></p><p>Overall, teaching children financial literacy is an important part of their education. By providing children with the basics of financial literacy, they can better understand the concept of money and how to use it responsibly. This can help them make informed financial decisions and prepare them for their financial future.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Teaching financial literacy to children is crucial for their future success. It is important to provide children with the tools and knowledge they need to make informed financial decisions, manage their money effectively and become financially responsible adults. By teaching children financial literacy at a young age, they will have a stronger foundation in managing their money, and be more likely to make smart financial decisions as they grow older.</p><p></p><p>One of the main benefits of teaching financial literacy to children is that it will help them to develop good spending and saving habits. Children who are taught the value of money and the importance of saving will be more likely to make smart financial decisions in the future.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Multimedia presentation has revolutionized the way teachers impart knowledge to their students. This approach has several advantages over traditional teaching methods, and it is an effective tool for engaging students and enhancing their learning experience. In this essay, I will outline the main benefits of using multimedia presentation in teaching students.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, multimedia presentations are visually appealing and more engaging than traditional teaching methods. This approach allows teachers to use a variety of media such as images, videos, and audio to present information in a way that is both interesting and interactive. When students are exposed to a dynamic and engaging presentation, they are more likely to retain the information and be motivated to learn.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, multimedia presentations are an effective way to reach students with different learning styles. For example, some students are visual learners and respond well to images and videos, while others are auditory learners and benefit from audio recordings and podcasts. By using multimedia presentations, teachers can cater to the needs of all their students, thereby increasing their chances of success.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, multimedia presentations are also an excellent way to impart knowledge on complex or abstract concepts. For example, it can be challenging to explain the intricacies of science or history to students, but by using multimedia presentations, teachers can use visual aids and interactive simulations to help students better understand these concepts. This approach is particularly useful for subjects such as mathematics and science, where visual aids are critical for helping students grasp complex concepts.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, multimedia presentations are cost-effective and easy to create. With the increasing availability of multimedia software and tools, teachers can easily create presentations that are both engaging and informative. This approach also allows teachers to create and store presentations that they can use in the future, making it a more efficient way of teaching.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, multimedia presentations offer a range of benefits to teachers and students alike. This approach is visually appealing, engaging, effective for different learning styles, useful for teaching complex concepts, and cost-effective. With the increasing use of technology in the classroom, it is essential for teachers to embrace multimedia presentations as a teaching tool and harness its full potential.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope this helps </p><p></p><br />

                            27. Write a reflective essay about EFFECTIVENESS OF TEACHING: FACE TO FACE OR ONLINE​</h2><br />
                        <p>The advent of technology has revolutionized the field of education, presenting new opportunities for both teachers and students. In recent years, online education has gained significant traction, offering a flexible and accessible learning environment. However, the debate surrounding the effectiveness of online teaching compared to traditional face-to-face instruction remains a subject of contention. In this essay, we will explore the merits and drawbacks of both approaches and analyze their impact on student learning outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Face-to-face teaching has long been the traditional mode of instruction, and it continues to offer numerous advantages. The physical presence of a teacher in the classroom allows for immediate interaction, fostering real-time engagement and dynamic discussions. In-person instruction provides a conducive environment for students to build strong personal connections with their peers and educators. Additionally, face-to-face teaching facilitates non-verbal communication, such as body language and facial expressions, which can enhance comprehension and clarity. These interpersonal connections and immediate feedback foster a sense of community and promote active learning.</p><p></p><p>Online teaching, on the other hand, has rapidly gained popularity due to its convenience and flexibility. Virtual classrooms transcend geographical barriers, enabling students from diverse locations to access quality education. The online environment offers numerous digital resources, multimedia content, and interactive platforms that can cater to different learning styles. Moreover, the flexibility of online learning allows students to pace themselves, revisiting materials as needed and accommodating their individual learning needs. Online teaching also promotes self-discipline and technological proficiency, skills that are increasingly relevant in today's digital world.</p><p></p><p>Despite its benefits, online teaching comes with its own set of challenges. Technical issues such as internet connectivity problems or software glitches can disrupt the flow of instruction and hinder effective communication. Additionally, the absence of face-to-face interaction may lead to a sense of isolation for some students, affecting their motivation and engagement. The lack of immediate feedback and physical presence can also make it more difficult for teachers to gauge student comprehension and provide personalized assistance. Furthermore, online learning requires students to possess a certain level of self-motivation and time-management skills to stay on track, which may not be universally present in all learners.</p><p></p><p>While the debate regarding the effectiveness of online and face-to-face teaching continues, it is clear that each approach has its own merits and challenges. Face-to-face teaching fosters interpersonal connections, immediate feedback, and active learning, while online teaching offers flexibility, accessibility, and a wide array of digital resources. Striking a balance between the two through hybrid models can provide students with a comprehensive and dynamic educational experience. Ultimately, the effectiveness of teaching lies in the adaptability of educators to leverage the strengths of both approaches and tailor their instruction to meet the needs of their students in an ever-evolving educational landscape.</p><br />
