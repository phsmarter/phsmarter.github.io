Learning Task 4: Read the sample abstract of a completed quantitative research. Identify
the variables of the study and construct a conceptual framework.
Research Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
Example of a Research 
Hypothesis
Question: Is there a significant 
relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?

                                            Name: ____________________________________  Date: _______ Understanding Dependent and Independent Variables As part of the scientific process, researchers, scientists and even ordinary people conduct experiments every day to find out more about the world we live in. An experiments needs to be carefully designed to make sure it accurately measures what it is supposed to so that the results are correct and so that the experiment can be repeated by someone else. Basic experiments are based upon a hypothesis that tries to predict the outcome of the experiment. Many experiments do not show that their hypothesis is true. These experiments are still valuable because they help to guide further research into an area that scientists are interested in.  Experiments test the influence of one thing over another. A proper experiment compares two or more things but changes only one variable or factor in the experiment. One example that is often used is an experiment that tests the influence of fertilizer on the growth of plants. The hypothesis states that plants that get fertilizer grow taller than plants that get no fertilizer. For any particular plant in the experiment, the amount of fertilizer it will get during the experiment is determined in advance by the experimenter. Some plants will get no fertilizer while others will get a measured amount. In this example, the independent variable is the amount of fertilizer. The other term used in experiments is dependent variable. The dependent variable is what is measured in the experiment. In this example, the dependent variable is how tall the plants are. The dependent variable (how tall the plants are) depends on the independent variable (the amount of fertilizer). Example: Stress increases the heart rate of a person. Dependent variable (what is measured in the experiment):  heart rate Independent variable (what is controlled in the experiment):  the amount of stress Exercise:          Lifting weights increases the breathing rate of a person.          Dependent variable: _______________________          Independent variable: ______________________​</a>

                            10. 1. What do you see as the main difference between a successful and      an unsuccessful decision? How much does luck versus skill have to do with      it? How much time needs to pass to answer the first question?
2.Research has shown that over half of the decisions made within      organizations fail. Does this surprise you? Why or why not?
3.Have you used the rational decision-making model to make a      decision? What was the context? How well did the model work?
4.Share an example of a decision where you used satisficing. Were      you happy with the outcome? Why or why not? When would you be most likely      to engage in satisficing?
5.Do you think intuition is respected as a decision-making style?      Do you think it should be? Why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p>1.Most people would interpret the phrase "successful" decision to mean a decision that results in a successful outcome.In my opinion, a decision based on sound decision making principles, should leave you with the minimum regret for choosing a particular path or outcome. If you find yourself agonizing over your decision, or "second guessing" it, then you have an unsuccessful decision.In other words, there is a critically important distinction between how we evaluate the process of making the decision versus how we evaluate the outcome that results. As much as we would like to learn how to make successful decisions consistently, or more consistently.Almost all interesting real-world decisions involve uncertainties, and as much as we can try to understand and incorporate them in a good decision-making process, the outcome will still be determined partly by chance. Luck will always be a factor, although not in the way that most people think about it.What many people think of as “luck” is really having a higher risk tolerance combined with personal resilience. Look for opportunities, take risks, capitalize on your wins and most importantly, learn from and don’t be discouraged by your mistakes and losses. This is very trendy right now as the growth mindset. The key idea here is that you can make your own luck, in the sense that you can be more open to opportunity, and work to benefit from whatever outcomes arise from those opportunities.Skills are the result of your particular passion towards something from years.</p><br />

the variables of the study and construct a conceptual framework.
Research Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
Example of a Research 
Hypothesis
Question: Is there a significant 
relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Survey research a research method involving the use of standardized questionnaires or interviews to collect data about people and their preferences, thoughts, and behaviors in a systematic manner. Although census surveys were conducted as early as Ancient Egypt, survey as a formal research method was pioneered in the 1930-40s by sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld to examine the effects of the radio on political opinion formation of the United States. This method has since become a very popular method for quantitative research in the social sciences.</p><p></p><p>The survey method can be used for descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory research. This method is best suited for studies that have individual people as the unit of analysis. Although other units of analysis, such as groups, organizations or dyads (pairs of organizations, such as buyers and sellers), are also studied using surveys, such studies often use a specific person from each unit as a “key informant” or a “proxy” for that unit, and such surveys may be subject to respondent bias if the informant chosen does not have adequate knowledge or has a biased opinion about the phenomenon of interest. For instance, Chief Executive Officers may not adequately know employee’s perceptions or teamwork in their own companies, and may therefore be the wrong informant for studies of team dynamics or employee self-esteem.</p><p></p><p>Survey research has several inherent strengths compared to other research methods. First, surveys are an excellent vehicle for measuring a wide variety of unobservable data, such as people’s preferences (e.g., political orientation), traits (e.g., self-esteem), attitudes (e.g., toward immigrants), beliefs (e.g., about a new law), behaviors (e.g., smoking or drinking behavior), or factual information (e.g., income). Second, survey research is also ideally suited for remotely collecting data about a population that is too large to observe directly. A large area, such as an entire country, can be covered using mail-in, electronic mail, or telephone surveys using meticulous sampling to ensure that the population is adequately represented in a small sample. Third, due to their unobtrusive nature and the ability to respond at one’s convenience, questionnaire surveys are preferred by some respondents. Fourth, interviews may be the only way of reaching certain population groups such as the homeless or illegal immigrants for which there is no sampling frame available. Fifth, large sample surveys may allow detection of small effects even while analyzing multiple variables, and depending on the survey design, may also allow comparative analysis of population subgroups (i.e., within-group and between-group analysis). Sixth, survey research is economical in terms of researcher time, effort and cost than most other methods such as experimental research and case research. At the same time, survey research also has some unique disadvantages. It is subject to a large number of biases such as non-response bias, sampling bias, social desirability bias, and recall bias, as discussed in the last section of this chapter.</p><p></p><p>Depending on how the data is collected, survey research can be divided into two broad categories: questionnaire surveys (which may be mail-in, group-administered, or online surveys), and interview surveys (which may be personal, telephone, or focus group interviews). Questionnaires are instruments that are completed in writing by respondents, while interviews are completed by the interviewer based on verbal responses provided by respondents. As discussed below, each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, in terms of their costs, coverage of the target population, and researcher’s flexibility in asking questions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps,mark me as your brainliest</p><br />

                            23. Name: ____________________________________  Date: _______ Understanding Dependent and Independent Variables As part of the scientific process, researchers, scientists and even ordinary people conduct experiments every day to find out more about the world we live in. An experiments needs to be carefully designed to make sure it accurately measures what it is supposed to so that the results are correct and so that the experiment can be repeated by someone else. Basic experiments are based upon a hypothesis that tries to predict the outcome of the experiment. Many experiments do not show that their hypothesis is true. These experiments are still valuable because they help to guide further research into an area that scientists are interested in.  Experiments test the influence of one thing over another. A proper experiment compares two or more things but changes only one variable or factor in the experiment. One example that is often used is an experiment that tests the influence of fertilizer on the growth of plants. The hypothesis states that plants that get fertilizer grow taller than plants that get no fertilizer. For any particular plant in the experiment, the amount of fertilizer it will get during the experiment is determined in advance by the experimenter. Some plants will get no fertilizer while others will get a measured amount. In this example, the independent variable is the amount of fertilizer. The other term used in experiments is dependent variable. The dependent variable is what is measured in the experiment. In this example, the dependent variable is how tall the plants are. The dependent variable (how tall the plants are) depends on the independent variable (the amount of fertilizer). Example: Stress increases the heart rate of a person. Dependent variable (what is measured in the experiment):  heart rate Independent variable (what is controlled in the experiment):  the amount of stress Exercise:          Lifting weights increases the breathing rate of a person.          Dependent variable: _______________________          Independent variable: ______________________​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1. Objective</strong></p>Objective is defined as someone or something that is real or not imagined. An example of objective is an actual tree, rather than a painting of a tree. ... Objective means someone or something that is without bias. An example of objective is a juror who doesn't know anything about the case they're assigned to.<p></p><p>2. Clearly Defined Research Questions</p>A clearly defined research question consists of (where appropriate) identification of study participants, intervention (or exposure) along with a comparator, and outcomes.<p></p><p></p><p>3. Structured Research Instruments</p>Structured questionnaire is the primary measuring instrument in survey research. The use of structured questionnaire has a close relationship with quantitative analysis. ... A typical example of a structured questionnaire is the Census questionnaire, which collects demographic information from individuals.<p></p><p></p><p>4.Numerical data</p>Numerical data represent values that can be measured and put into a logical order. Examples of numerical data are height, weight, age, number of movies watched, IQ, etc. To graph numerical data, one uses dot plots, stem and leaf graphs, histograms, box plots, ogive graphs, and scatter plots.<p></p><p></p><p>5.large Sample Sizes</p>Nonetheless, the concept of large sample size appears to be relative. Lin, Lucas, and Shmueli (2013) considered sample sizes over 10,000 cases to be large.<p></p><p></p><p>6.Replication</p>Replication is the act of reproducing or copying something, or is a copy of something. When an experiment is repeated and the results from the original are reproduced, this is an example of a replication of the original study. A copy of a Monet painting is an example of a replication.<p></p><p></p><p>7.Future Outcomes​</p>Forecasting is contingent upon predictability where a result is expected to be consistently observed and uncertainty, which is the level of potential deviation from expected results.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>PA BRAINLLEST PO...
