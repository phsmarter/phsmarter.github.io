The importance of oral communication should be no different than the necessity of math, reading, or writing. Oral communication by definition is communication by word of mouth. Children must be confident in their speaking abilities because many careers require this skill. Schools must reconsider how important it is to promote oral communication, examine why it has been limited in schools, and learn how to teach it more effectively. Oral communication skills are a necessity that every child will need as an adult.</p><p></p><p>Oral communication is an important skill because it promotes leadership and confidence. When children are confident in their abilities they will succeed academically and socially. It is important for students to generate their own ideas using outside references in the community (Joseph and Efron, pg 5-6). Oftentimes some students have trouble making friends. If they can learn to be more confident in their speaking abilities they will be more likely to approach their peers. On the other hand, when students feel comfortable expressing their ideas in front of people they will most likely contribute more to class discussions. Teachers always have difficulty with getting their students to participate constructively, so if the teacher spends more time teaching their students how to talk and respond coherently children will be more likely to contribute. It is important for teachers to create “academically responsive classrooms (Tomlinsen, pg 1)”. This feeling of confidence and increased leadership abilities will benefit the entire class because discussions will become more in depth and student generated. If students feel less apprehension about speaking in public they will be more likely to express their ideas. When oral communication is learned and perfected in students their success rate in academics will escalate especially when they are required to formulate ideas quickly in writing.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        ANSWER :<br /><br />Effective communication is the backbone of any successful organization. Whether it’s communicating with colleagues, clients, or other stakeholders, the ability to convey ideas and information clearly and effectively is essential in any work setting. Oral presentations are one of the most important communication tools in the workplace, and they serve a variety of purposes. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why oral presentations are related to communication for work purposes.<br /><br />Firstly, oral presentations are a powerful way to convey information to an audience. They allow a presenter to share ideas, data, and insights in a way that is engaging and impactful. By using visuals, stories, and other techniques, a presenter can make complex or dry information more accessible and interesting. This is especially important in the workplace, where time is often at a premium and audiences need to quickly understand and absorb information. Oral presentations can help to achieve this goal more effectively than written materials or other communication methods.<br /><br />Secondly, oral presentations are a great way to build credibility and authority. When a presenter is able to confidently and clearly articulate their ideas, they are seen as more knowledgeable and trustworthy. This is important in the workplace, where people need to trust and rely on one another to get things done. By giving a well-prepared and engaging presentation, a presenter can establish themselves as an expert in their field, and gain the respect and attention of their colleagues and superiors.<br /><br />Thirdly, oral presentations are an important way to persuade and influence others. In many workplaces, getting others to buy into your ideas and proposals is crucial for success. Oral presentations can be used to make a persuasive case for a particular course of action or to convince others of the value of a particular idea. By using persuasive language, evidence, and other tools, a presenter can sway the opinions and decisions of others in a way that is difficult to achieve through other communication methods.<br /><br />Fourthly, oral presentations can be used to foster teamwork and collaboration. By presenting ideas and information to a group, a presenter can create a shared understanding and sense of purpose. This is important in the workplace, where collaboration and teamwork are often essential for success. By presenting ideas in a clear and engaging way, a presenter can help to align the goals and objectives of different team members, and create a shared vision for the future.<br /><br />Finally, oral presentations can be used to build relationships and network with others. By presenting at conferences, seminars, or other events, a presenter can connect with colleagues and other professionals in their field. This can lead to new opportunities, collaborations, and partnerships. By sharing ideas and information with others, a presenter can build a reputation and establish themselves as a valuable contributor to their field.<br /><br />In conclusion, oral presentations are an essential tool for communication in the workplace. They serve a variety of purposes, from conveying information to persuading and influencing others, to building credibility and authority. By mastering the art of oral presentations, individuals can become more effective communicators and leaders, and help to achieve success in their organizations.<br />

In the current era of globalization, interaction can occur more easily. </p><p>The way to communicate with anyone is wide open, of course with the help of technological developments that are increasingly practical. In this way, <strong>communication between different cultures finally occurs.</strong></p><p>In the Cultural Studies of Communication, it is taught that<strong> cultural diversity is learned, not eliminated</strong>. That is, avoiding conflicts between different cultures, does not mean we have to equate all existing cultures. This might be able to minimize conflicts that could occur due to cultural differences, but it could also lead to other conflicts. </p><p>Therefore, cultural diversity cannot be eliminated just like that. Not feeling oneself and one's own culture as superior and demeaning other people's cultures, as well as wanting to learn to build better relationships between many cultures, is an attitude that is found by studying Cultural Studies of Communication.</p><p>As social beings, humans need to interact, whether in any form it is unavoidable, as well in inter-cultural interactions. We will always interact with other people from different cultures. </p><p>For example, as a student myself, I met friends from various islands, with different cultural backgrounds. I myself am a native of Sulawesi with a rather fast speech tempo and also a bit louder, while my friends are mostly Javanese who are famous for their calm nature. </p><p>There are differences here, but I understand my friend's culture and try to respect it. So, even though we have differences, we can still be friends and interact smoothly. </p><p>For this reason, studying Communication Cultural Studies can help us to interact better because Communication Cultural Studies is not only studying culture but also respecting the existing cultural diversity.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about essays at https://brainly.ph/question/18900841</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            25. write a 700 words essay about Why does oral presentation related to communication for work purposes?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Oral presentations are a critical component of effective workplace communication, as they allow individuals to share information, ideas, and opinions in a clear and concise manner. Whether it is delivering a sales pitch, presenting a project proposal, or leading a team meeting, oral presentations are an essential tool for successful communication in the workplace.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary reasons why oral presentations are so important for work purposes is that they help individuals to convey their message clearly and effectively. Unlike written communication, which can be misinterpreted or misunderstood, oral presentations allow individuals to use their voice, tone, and body language to convey their message in a more impactful way. This is particularly important in situations where there is a lot of information to convey or where the topic may be complex or technical.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why oral presentations are critical for workplace communication is that they allow individuals to engage with their audience in a more personal and interactive way. Whether it is a one-on-one presentation or a large group presentation, oral presentations provide individuals with the opportunity to build relationships and connect with their audience on a deeper level. This can help to build trust, establish credibility, and ultimately, achieve the desired outcome of the presentation.</p><p></p><p>In addition to building relationships, oral presentations also help to inspire and motivate individuals in the workplace. Whether it is a motivational speech, a team-building exercise, or a training session, oral presentations provide individuals with the opportunity to inspire and motivate their audience to achieve their goals. This is particularly important in a work environment where individuals may be facing challenges or obstacles, as it can help to boost morale and create a more positive and productive work environment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, oral presentations are a critical tool for effective leadership in the workplace. Whether it is leading a team meeting or presenting a strategic plan, oral presentations provide leaders with the opportunity to communicate their vision, goals, and expectations in a clear and concise manner. This can help to inspire and motivate their team, build trust and credibility, and ultimately, achieve success in their respective roles.</p><p></p><p>Finally, oral presentations are important for workplace communication because they help individuals to develop and refine their communication skills. Oral presentations require individuals to be confident, articulate, and organized, which are all essential skills for effective communication in the workplace. By regularly presenting in front of an audience, individuals can develop these skills and become more effective communicators, which can ultimately help them to advance in their careers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, oral presentations are a critical component of effective workplace communication. They allow individuals to convey their message clearly and effectively, engage with their audience in a more personal and interactive way, inspire and motivate individuals in the workplace, provide leaders with the opportunity to communicate their vision and goals, and help individuals to develop and refine their communication skills. Whether it is delivering a sales pitch, presenting a project proposal, or leading a team meeting, oral presentations are an essential tool for successful communication in the workplace. Therefore, it is important for individuals to invest time and effort in developing their oral presentation skills, as it can ultimately help them to achieve success in their respective roles and advance in their careers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana Po Maka tulong </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The way you look, listen, move, and react to another person tells them more about how you're feeling than words alone ever can. Nonverbal communication, or body language, includes facial expressions, body movement and gestures, eye contact, posture, the tone of your voice, and even your muscle tension and breathing.<p></p>As you can see, there are at least 6 distinct types of communication: non-verbal, verbal-oral-face-to-face, verbal-oral-distance, verbal-written, formal and informal types of communication.<br />
