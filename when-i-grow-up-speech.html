                                            What's the summary of Hyde Park by Petina Gappah?
	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.
London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.
As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.
I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.
I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.
I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.
Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity
It is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.
I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</a>

This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility - we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow - education, infrastructure, research - we should cut what we don't need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs. This shouldn't be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking - not growing. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don't think it's good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don't like compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn't governing - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we're Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.

Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.
Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was
reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a
time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually
harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been
higher.
The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we
need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the
middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.
It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and
Republicans can work together right away.
First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster
and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So
we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay
better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we
should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult
as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.
Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America
that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would
secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The
majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.
Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable
children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term
certainty they deserve.
We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places
where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like
compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t
govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just
hurting the people we were sent here to serve.
Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from
different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans,

It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</a>

 “A borrowed book is like a guest in the house; it must be treated with punctiliousness, with a
 certain considerate formality. You must see that it sustains no damage; it must not suffer while under your roof. You cannot leave it carelessly, you cannot mark it, you cannot turn down the
 pages, you cannot use it familiarly. And then, someday, although this is seldom done, you really
 ought to return it.” _______________________________________________________
 You have left it to women in your land, the men of all civilized countries have left it to women,
 to work out their own salvation. That is the way in which we women of England are doing. Human life for us is sacred, but we say if any life is to be sacrificed it shall be ours; we won’t do it ourselves, but we will put the enemy in the position where they will have to choose between giving us
 freedom or giving us death.” ___________________________________

 have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should
 dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonor shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your
 virtues in the field.”_______________________________________________

 the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its

                                            Learning Task 3Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Of course! Here's a potential speech you could give on your career day as a future president:</p><p></p><p>"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for having me here today to talk about my aspirations for the future. As you may have heard, I want to be the president of the United States when I grow up. I know that might sound like a lofty goal, but I truly believe that with hard work, determination, and a commitment to serving others, anything is possible.</p><p></p><p>I've always been interested in politics and public service. Even as a young child, I was fascinated by the way government works and how leaders can make a difference in people's lives. As I've grown older, that fascination has turned into a passion, and I've spent countless hours reading about history, current events, and political philosophy.</p><p></p><p>But being president isn't just about knowing a lot of facts and figures. It's also about having the right character traits and values. I believe that a good president should be honest, humble, and empathetic. They should be able to listen to all sides of an issue and make decisions based on what's best for the country as a whole, not just for a particular group or constituency.</p><p></p><p>One thing that makes me unique as a future president is my background. I come from a working-class family, and I know firsthand the challenges that many Americans face on a daily basis. I've seen how hard my parents work to provide for our family, and I've seen how difficult it can be to make ends meet, even when you're doing everything right.</p><p></p><p>That's why, if I'm lucky enough to be elected president one day, my top priority will be to create a more equitable society where everyone has a fair shot at success. I believe in investing in education, creating good jobs, and ensuring that everyone has access to affordable healthcare. I also believe in protecting our environment, so that future generations can enjoy the same beauty and bounty that we do today.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I know that becoming president won't be easy. It will take years of hard work, starting with getting a good education and gaining experience in public service. But I'm committed to doing whatever it takes to make my dream a reality, because I believe that with the right leadership, we can build a brighter future for all Americans.</p><p></p><p>Thank you again for having me here today, and I hope that my words have inspired some of you to pursue your own dreams, whatever they may be."</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>If you think my answer helps, please, mark me as a brainliest. That's the only way to appreciate my efforts. </p><p></p><br />

                            6. What's the summary of Hyde Park by Petina Gappah?
	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.
London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.
As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.
I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.
I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.
I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.
Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity
It is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.
I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2.

We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us.

                            8. Learning Task 2: Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table. Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility - we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow - education, infrastructure, research - we should cut what we don't need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs. This shouldn't be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking - not growing. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don't think it's good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don't like compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn't governing - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we're Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love. Thanks everybody and have a great weekend. Point/Claim Evidences Type of Evidence​</h2><br />

                            16. Learning Task 3
Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.
Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was
reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a
time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually
harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been
higher.
The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we
need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the
middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.
It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and
Republicans can work together right away.
First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster
and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So
we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay
better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we
should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult
as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.
Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America
that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would
secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The
majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.
Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable
children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term
certainty they deserve.
We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places
where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like
compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t

Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</h2><br />

There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise.

Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we</p><p></p><p>need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the</p><p></p><p>middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.</p><p></p><p>It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and</p><p></p><p>Republicans can work together right away.</p><p></p><p>First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster</p><p></p><p>and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So</p><p></p><p>we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay</p><p></p><p>better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we</p><p></p><p>should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult</p><p></p><p>as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.</p><p></p><p>Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America</p><p></p><p>that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would</p><p></p><p>secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The</p><p></p><p>majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.</p><p></p><p>Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable</p><p></p><p>children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term</p><p></p><p>certainty they deserve.</p><p></p><p>We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places</p><p></p><p>where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like</p><p></p><p>compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t</p><p></p><p>govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just</p><p></p><p>hurting the people we were sent here to serve.</p><p></p><p>Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from</p><p></p><p>different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans,</p><p></p><p>to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.</p><br />
