Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and Thelr Effects on Academic Performance Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concem that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems. Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction. In general, IGD has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions. However, a study conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denotes a disparity on the result of academic performance between IGD and mobile phone addiction. Cyberbullying, on the other hand, is also an ethical concern that has affected several adolescents and adults. Previous studies on traditional bullying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students.

                                            On academic performance The academic performance of a student who was addicted to gaming suffered. Since the student is too engrossed in the game to finish their assignments or prepare for class, they found that gaming addiction has a negative physical impact on academic performance. Others have shown a connection between playing online games and performing worse in school. Even if the respondents play online games, their academic performance is unaffected. Even though they spent time playing, they nevertheless received good grades. Overall, the respondents’ academic performance is strong despite their interest in playing online games, according to the study’s findings. This can be seen as the compromise made when playing video games. There won’t be any points deducted from the student’s grade if they elect not to participate (Dennis O. Dumrique and Jennifer G. Castillo, 2018). According to university of Syracuse reported that being addicted to games may lead to decrease sleep, inference with the demands of society life including socializing and academic work. These online games have a big factor that affects the students in their academic performances in school. According much attention has been directed to the use of online games for learning in the recent years, in part due to the straggering amounts of capital spent on games in the entertainment industry, but also because of their ability to captivate player attention and hold it for lengthy periods of time as players learn to master game complexities and accomplish objectives. pahanap Po ng reference ​please </a>

The problem of addiction to online games is also associated with psychological and social issues, such as depression, anxiety, and social isolation, which can further impact academic performance.</p><p></p><p>The negative effects of addiction to online games on student academic performance can be mitigated through various interventions. One approach is to limit students' access to online games and monitor their use. Schools and parents can work together to develop strategies for reducing the amount of time students spend on online games, such as setting limits on the amount of time students can spend on games per day or week. Additionally, schools can offer support services to students struggling with addiction to online games, such as counseling, education, and alternative activities to help them build more positive and productive habits.</p><p></p><p>Another approach is to incorporate online games into the learning process, such as using educational games to teach important concepts and skills. This approach can help students see the value of online games beyond mere entertainment and can help them develop a more positive attitude towards learning. By incorporating online games into the curriculum, schools can also help students build the skills necessary to succeed in a digital world, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration.</p><p></p><p>Schools and parents can work together to create a supportive environment for students struggling with addiction to online games. This includes providing emotional support, setting achievable goals, and celebrating successes. By creating a supportive environment, students can feel more motivated and empowered to overcome their addiction to online games and improve their academic performance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Summary:<br />Online gaming has become a popular leisure activity among students, but its negative effects on academic performance have been a concern for educators and parents. This paper aims to summarize and synthesize recent research on the impact of addiction to online games on students' academic performance. The paper found that addiction to online games is associated with a decline in academic performance, as students become distracted, experience sleep deprivation, and become disengaged from their academic responsibilities. Additionally, addiction to online games can also lead to social isolation and interpersonal conflicts, further impacting academic performance.<br /><br />Synthesis:<br />A number of studies have been conducted on the effects of addiction to online games on students' academic performance, with many highlighting the negative consequences. For example, a study conducted by Li and colleagues (2020) found that addiction to online games was associated with poor academic performance and lower grades. The study involved 369 students and found that those who reported higher levels of addiction to online games had lower GPA scores than their peers who did not play games excessively.<br /><br />Similarly, a study by Chiu and colleagues (2017) found that addiction to online games was negatively correlated with academic achievement. The study involved 2,484 high school students and found that those who reported higher levels of addiction to online games were more likely to have lower grades and lower academic aspirations.<br /><br />One of the main reasons for the negative impact of addiction to online games on academic performance is that it can lead to distraction and procrastination. When students become addicted to online games, they may spend more time playing than studying, leading to poor time management and reduced academic engagement. A study by Pontes and Griffiths (2016) found that online gaming addiction was associated with decreased academic engagement and lower academic performance, as students spent more time gaming and less time studying.<br /><br />In addition, addiction to online games can lead to sleep deprivation, which can further impact academic performance. A study by Khazaal and colleagues (2016) found that online gaming addiction was associated with poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration, which in turn can lead to decreased cognitive functioning and impaired academic performance.<br /><br />Moreover, addiction to online games can lead to social isolation and interpersonal conflicts, further impacting academic performance. Students who become addicted to online games may withdraw from social activities and relationships, which can impact their social and emotional development. Additionally, students who become addicted to online games may experience interpersonal conflicts with peers and family members, which can cause stress and further impact academic performance.<br /><br />In conclusion, addiction to online games can have a negative impact on students' academic performance. Studies have shown that addiction to online games is associated with distraction, procrastination, sleep deprivation, social isolation, and interpersonal conflicts, all of which can lead to poor academic performance. Educators and parents need to be aware of the negative consequences of addiction to online games and take steps to help students balance their leisure activities with their academic responsibilities. This may involve setting limits on screen time, encouraging physical activity and social engagement, and providing support for students who may be struggling with addiction. By taking a proactive approach, educators and parents can help students achieve their academic goals and develop healthy habits for the future.<br />

                        There have been various studies conducted on the correlation between gaming addiction and academic performance, but the results are not always consistent or conclusive.

Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and Thelr Effects on Academic Performance Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concem that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems. Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction. In general, IGD has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions. However, a study conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denotes a disparity on the result of academic performance between IGD and mobile phone addiction. Cyberbullying, on the other hand, is also an ethical concern that has affected several adolescents and adults. Previous studies on traditional bullying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>online game addiction can have severe negative consequences. Though most of the symptoms listed above have short-term effects, they can lead to more severe long-term repercussions if not addressed properly. For example, someone addicted to video games will often avoid sleeping or eating proper meals in order to continue gaming. While the short-term effects of this may include hunger and fatigue, it could eventually lead to a sleep disorder or diet-related health issues. Similarly, those who isolate themselves from others in order to play video games may miss out on family events, outings with friends, or other events in the short-term. If this continues to be a pattern for a long period of time, however, addicts might find themselves without any friends at all.</p><br />

                            11. On academic performance The academic performance of a student who was addicted to gaming suffered. Since the student is too engrossed in the game to finish their assignments or prepare for class, they found that gaming addiction has a negative physical impact on academic performance. Others have shown a connection between playing online games and performing worse in school. Even if the respondents play online games, their academic performance is unaffected. Even though they spent time playing, they nevertheless received good grades. Overall, the respondents’ academic performance is strong despite their interest in playing online games, according to the study’s findings. This can be seen as the compromise made when playing video games. There won’t be any points deducted from the student’s grade if they elect not to participate (Dennis O. Dumrique and Jennifer G. Castillo, 2018). According to university of Syracuse reported that being addicted to games may lead to decrease sleep, inference with the demands of society life including socializing and academic work. These online games have a big factor that affects the students in their academic performances in school. According much attention has been directed to the use of online games for learning in the recent years, in part due to the straggering amounts of capital spent on games in the entertainment industry, but also because of their ability to captivate player attention and hold it for lengthy periods of time as players learn to master game complexities and accomplish objectives. pahanap Po ng reference ​please </h2><br />

                        What is the delimitation for online gaming addiction?<p>Many of us have stayed up late playing our favorite computer or online <strong>games</strong> on multiple occasions. And some of us have even received complaints from our families and significant others about how much time we spend online <strong>gaming</strong> instead of with them and their academics. Perhaps a few of us have desired that we could play a <strong>game</strong> while at work. However, this is a serious issue currently. Playing too many online <strong>games </strong>is becoming a rising phenomenon, according to psychologists and scientific researchers. News articles are raising awareness of the problem, and some gaming companies are even being sued by bereaved parents. An online<strong> game</strong> is a video that is played over a computer network. Because of this, the researcher was encouraged and desires to know if the selected high school kids are not studying or focusing effectively on their studies because they are playing online games, and what are the prospective implications of this said topic. This study aims to demonstrate the link between academic achievement and playing online <strong>games</strong> among SJCNI high school students. The outcome of this study will be determined by the population's response.</p><p>What is the effect of addiction in online games? brainly.ph/question/2307903</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
