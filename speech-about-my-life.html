                                            D Learning Task 1: Read President Manuel L. Quezon's autobiography taken from his privilege speech delivered in 1933. Then, answer the questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law." own Source: http://www quezon ph/familyinfo/autoblography of manuell quezon-from-a-privilege-speech/ 1.

Learning Task 1: Read President Manuel L. Quezon’s autobiography 
taken from his privilege speech delivered in 1933. Then, answer the 
questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. 
“I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher 
in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. 
My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare 
rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and 
during my early youth, my father saved as much as he 
could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos 
with which to give me an education. During those 
Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small 
town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, 
did my family live for years. When I was at the age of 
five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father 
and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary 
instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and 
began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived 
in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who 
could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My 
classes started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very 
early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the 
following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an 
intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest 
honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my 
education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my 
studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came 
to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had 
become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a 
lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me 
as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board 
and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.”

Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2.

In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now.

While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law." own Source: http://www quezon ph/familyinfo/autoblography of manuell quezon-from-a-privilege-speech/ 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer :</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Hi, my name is (yourname ) , and I am a senior at (your school) High School. Let me just tell you that being a student in today’s society is not always easy.</p><p></p><p>Adults often tell us that we don’t know what stress is and to just wait until we grow up. But we as teenage students have our own levels of stress. For instance, all school activities require you to uphold your grade point average to high standards, along with the expectations that you dedicate any extra time to it day and night.</p><p></p><p>Then, getting your homework turned in on time seems simple, but you still hope to have a life outside of school as well. Many students in their high school years start their first job, so now you have school in the mornings, followed by responsibilities needing to be taken care of at home and then you’re off to work.</p><p></p><p>By the time you are done there, you are too exhausted to finish your school work, but you stay up late to try and return to school feeling half conscious the next day. What good is that?</p><p></p><p>Now, let me remind you that we are becoming young adults, and some of the students have gotten involved in serious relationships, maybe even gotten married. Of course that doesn’t give a free pass that exempts you from homework, but it does make home life stressful when you are trying to have a relationship as well.</p><p>Also, more than ever before, young girls are becoming mothers, and that means if she even continues to attend school after giving birth, she is now a full-time mother, as well as trying to accomplish homework assignments just to graduate.</p><p></p><p>Going through something like that makes you vulnerable to being bullied. These are students who are constantly trying to hide in the background, feeling judged and ridiculed in a place where they should be accepted.</p><p></p><p>Let’s not forget about peer pressure. All high school students are exposed to it at some point in their life. High school can be a place where students are made fun of, disapproved, singled out and pointed at.</p><p>Each of us has a choice on how to accept these challenges in his or her life, and for that, I choose my faith. I have expressed some of the challenges we face in just being a student. Yet, I haven’t even touched on how difficult it is to be a Christian teenager in high school today.</p><p></p><p>Professing yourself to be a Christian opens a lot of doors where you must defend yourself, like being involved in the Christian Club or even praying at the lunch table before you eat. Being a Christian in high school tests your faith to high measures, watching young women give themselves away, students not caring about their grades, others dropping out and the list goes on and on.</p><p></p><p>My point is, it is a whole lot more stressful to be a student in high school than adults believe. Though it shouldn’t be this way, it only gets worse as years pass by. And we are constantly being judged, especially for what we believe in.</p><p></p><p>So our “stress” may not involve paying bills, buying groceries or taking care of a family, but I’m sure if the adults in our lives could go back to school today, they would be surprised at how much it has changed.</p><p></p><p>I don’t want you to think for a minute that there aren’t good moments and memories made while we are students. We find our friends, our mentors and, if we are lucky, ourselves!</p><p></p><p>My mom always tells me to enjoy it while I can — ‘it’ being my youth. I know that the world outside of school is often harsh and that the responsibilities are serious. That’s exactly why I know that the focus I give to my future is essential in helping me navigate my way into a career that will allow me to contribute to society and enjoy who and what I become.</p><p>I want to remind everyone, including myself, that in this moment, we are as old as we have ever been, and as young as we will be again. Live in the moment! If this was your last moment, would you be able to say you were living? I want to be able to say yes. So that’s what I am trying to do — learning as I go, wearing faith as my armor and knowing that in God’s plan we are all students and teachers, too.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>you can change some words if you like:)</strong></p><br />

questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. 
“I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher 
in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. 
My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare 
rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and 
during my early youth, my father saved as much as he 
could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos 
with which to give me an education. During those 
Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small 
town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, 
did my family live for years. When I was at the age of 
five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father 
and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary 
instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and 
began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived 
in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who 
could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My 
classes started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very 
early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the 
following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an 
intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest 
honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my 
education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my 
studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came 
to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had 
become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a 
lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me 
as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board 
and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.”

We should also learn to say no to things that don't align with our goals or priorities.</p><p></p><p>Remember, time is a valuable commodity, and we should treat it as such.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the value of my life</p><p></p><p>Good day everyone. </p><p></p><p>I am so glad to be here today and to have the opportunity to talk about the value of my life. As I am sure you can relate, life can be full of both good and bad days, and it can sometimes be difficult to find its value. Today I’d like to speak from my experience and share why my life has been worth living.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, my life has been filled with love. Throughout my entire life I have been surrounded by family and close friends who are always there for me, not just in the good times but also in the bad, which is something that I cannot take for granted. Knowing that there are people who care deeply about me is incredibly humbling and reassuring, and this has given me strength over the years and enabled me to press on even when times were tough.</p><p></p><p>In addition, I consider each day as an opportunity to learn, grow, and discover something new. Each day provides a chance to learn from experiences no matter how small or insignificant it might seem, such as learning patience from a frustrating customer service experience or learning from a mistake. Life is full of learning experiences which I can use as stepping stones for my personal development.</p><p></p><p>My job also plays a key role in the value of my life, as it helps me fulfill my financial responsibilities whether it’s to save for retirement or put food on the table. It also provides mental stimulation on a daily basis, and I find meaning in my work which has made a massive difference in my outlook on life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, one of the most important things I do every day is take time for myself and do things that bring me joy; things like making music, cooking delicious meals, or simply taking a walk outdoors. Taking just a few minutes each day to do something enjoyable gives me room to breathe and helps keep me mentally healthy.</p><p></p><p>Overall, these are just some of the reasons why I believe the value of my life is so great; I am constantly surrounded by love, it's an opportunity to learn and grow daily, it helps me fulfill my financial obligations, and it encourages me to take time for myself. My life isn’t perfect by any means but I feel incredibly lucky to live every day with purpose and passion.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for your attention and for allowing me to share my story.</p><br />

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2.

I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4.

While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his ricefield, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My andclasses started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.” 1.
