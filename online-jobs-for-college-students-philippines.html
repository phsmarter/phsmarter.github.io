Nowadays, this can be a person's most efficient strategic tool for enabling himself to take charge and cope with the fast growing technology.</p><p>The fact that people live in on informative lifestyle where everything is updated, internet became one of the necessities of human beings regardless of age or sex in today's society. However, the influence of this useful machine on youth is undeniably questionable. As to what Rock [1] said, all these technologies are very good at distracting people. In line with this development, online gaming was created to give entertainment to people.</p><p>Online gaming is one of the widely used leisure activities by many people. For some people it is said that playing video games has a number of reasons to be played, for it can be a stress reliever, challenge and competition, relaxation, enjoyment, social interaction, and even mentally escaping from the real world.</p><p>For most people, on-line gaming is one of the best past time that they acquire specially for teenagers, youngsters and students. According to Kuss &amp; Griffiths [2], teens who play online games are just having fun. They do not just actually play because of some sort of seriousness, but also because they just want to feel relief. During school hours, students tend to feel stressed due to loads of school works and through playing it will relive their stress.</p><p>It is undeniably questionable that playing online games provide them something that no one can give. According to some researches it is beneficial. It enables the mind of the players to be more active, especially those puzzle-based games. Furthermore, it helps the player to come up with decisions in tight situations, especially those adventure games that keep the players to be alert, active and strategic.</p><p>Students' learning takes place unexpectedly, but the inappropriate usage of playing online games also leads in some problems such as being distracted in school. Further, it is where the attention of the child were divided that even their health and social life is unknowingly affected.</p><p>Several studies in psychology have found out that increased time spent on the Internet can lead to negative impact on a person's ability to communicate appropriately face-to-face with friends, peers, family members including parents [3].</p><p>Studies revealed that the human brain is easy to destruct and one of the reasons is using technology. The education system tends to go with the flow with this constant change in the society in order to get things relevant with the generations today.</p><p>The researchers felt the need to determine the impact of online gaming to students' academic performance and their social behavior. The purpose of this study is to find out the implications of on-line gaming to the academic performance and social behavior of the students.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>bala ka jan.</p><p></p><br />

Understanding student experiences: Qualitative research allows researchers to explore and understand students' experiences with online learning in-depth. By analyzing students' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, researchers can identify factors that affect academic performance in online learning, such as motivation, engagement, and self-regulated learning.</p><p></p><p>2.

The IPs comprise about 10% to 20% of the Philippines’s 102.9 million total populations. The Philippine educational system’s neo-colonial background creates injustice on some cultural minorities who can attend school. For this matter, the study measures the perceptions of the Dumagats on their rights to Education. It focuses on the Dumagat communities in the provinces of Nueva Ecija and Aurora in the Philippines. By using the simple binary quantitative tool, the qualitative method of research, the application of Indigenous research methods, and critical pedagogy as analytical lens, the study found that (a) the implementation of the Philippine policies on the rights to Education as reflected on the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA) of 1997 is more of a tokenism; (b) the enjoyment of the right to Education of IPs is hindered mainly by poverty; (c) English remains the widely used medium of instruction in most IP curricula; and (d) the IPs’ limited knowledge on specific provisions of IPRA related to the access to Education and culture is short of the policy ideals. The above findings necessitate change agents to start a process of pedagogical liberation. The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) personnel and IP teachers can play a vital role as change agents and may act to correct the historical injustices on IPs’ rights and welfare.<br />

Data were gathered from 101,570 clients, 391 of whom engaged in suicide behavior during treatment. Regression analyses revealed that suicide behavior was positively associated with 3 pretreatment variables: depression, prior suicide behavior, and prior nonsuicidal self-injury. Four latent classes of clients with suicidal ideation were identified that were named "prior ideation," "extensive risk," "prior treatment," and "circumscribed depression." The number of clients in each class varied widely, as did the relative risk of suicide behavior. Implications for treatment, suicide assessment, and suicide prevention are discussed.
