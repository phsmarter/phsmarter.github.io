                                            Reality TV shows are good entertainment Reality shows are a very popular forma di entertainment on TV sodass These are dozens of different types of programmes such as gng contests. cooking competitions or going to live in the jungle. about Firstly, I think that there is a lot of variety in reality TV. People at home can choose which types of programme they want to watch depending on what they are interested in. Some people like watching, singang, or cooking competitions while others prefer watching programmes building houses or travelling around the world. In addition, reality TV programmes are a great opportunity to discover talented singers, dancers, or chefs. Several people who take part in these programmes get jobs as a results being on TV. Another advantage is that the people on the shows have interesting experiences and meet new people. On the other hand, some people think that reality TV is an easy way for them to become famous. However, most succesful singers, actors or chefs have worked hard all their lives and are good at their job because of their bardwork. Also, sometimes the people on the shows have to do really difficult or dangerous things. The competitions are very hard and there is only one winner. Another disadvantage is that some programmes always follow the same format and this can be boring to watch. To sum up, I think that reality TV is a good entertainment. There is a lot of variety which means there is something for everyone and they are interesting to watch. What is being talked about in the text? Do you agree/disagree with this?

                            8. In a household, a family of seven members shares the spaces of two bedrooms, one comfort room, a kitchen, a living room and a balcony. The bedrooms have light bulbs and ceiling fan. The comfort room that has one light bulb is situated near the living room that also has light bulb, refrigerator, ceiling fan, and TV in place. In the kitchen space, light bulb, washing machine, heater and electric stove can be found. The household has also a balcony installed with a light bulb.1. How are the appliances at home connected? ________________________________2. Based on your answer in question 1 what are the advantages and disadvantages when electrical devices at home are connected in that manner? ________________________________3. If all these appliances are turned on at the same time for longer time, what do you think will happen? Explain your answer.________________________________4. What will you do to avoid electrical hazards at home?________________________________​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Electrical appliances are connected in a parallel arrangement in a house circuit because: Each appliance gets full voltage as resistance in a parallel arrangement is low. If one appliance fuses, it does not affect the working of other appliances.</p><p>2.there are some advantages and disadvantages as well. The advantage is that you can use them anytime you want on a 24/7 basis, only if you can afford to pay bigger bills. When electric is gone, it can be connected through a generator. The disadvantage of electric is that you need to pay every month or else it will be cut off. Not only that, you might experience power interruptions when there’s an official schedule or abnormal weather conditions. Whatever reason that is, you still need these electrical appliances in your kitchen. </p><p>3.It will lead to short-circuit and may cause fire</p><p>4.Look first. Don’t touch. The person may still be in contact with the electrical source. Touching the person may pass the current through you.</p><p>Call or have someone else call 911 or emergency medical help.</p><p>Turn off the source of electricity if possible. If not, move the source away from you and the affected person using a non-conducting object made of cardboard, plastic or wood.</p><p>Once the person is free of the source of electricity, check the person’s breathing and pulse. If either has stopped or seems dangerously slow or shallow, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately.</p><p>If the person is faint or pale or shows other signs of shock, lay him or her down with the head slightly lower than the trunk of the body and the legs elevated.</p><p>Don’t touch burns, break blisters, or remove burned clothing. Electrical shock may cause burns inside the body, so be sure the person is taken to a doctor</p><br />

When installed properly, they could have individual or separate switches.
You can add more components without changing the voltage. It only means that the voltage from the source would still be the same.
The layout is very simple and easy to assemble.<p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Disadvantages:  <strong>  </strong></p>Since the same amount of voltage is being distributed, it could increase the overall electricity bill.
There is a split of sources across the system so a lower resistance could happen and this type of circuit cannot be used effectively.
Most of the wirings inside the house use parallel connections and they require a lot of wires.<p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Series Connection</strong><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Advantages:  <strong>  </strong></p>Electricity is distributed and not multiplied. The units do not overheat easily since the amount of power from the source decreases as the number of units is added.
It is easy to repair damaged units in a series connection because their layout is simple.
We can also add more power devices and they will have a higher output in terms of voltage.<p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Disadvantages:<strong>  </strong></p>If one unit breaks or gets damaged, the whole connection will be affected.
The more units in the connection, the greater will be the circuit resistance.<strong>

                            20. Reality TV shows are good entertainment Reality shows are a very popular forma di entertainment on TV sodass These are dozens of different types of programmes such as gng contests. cooking competitions or going to live in the jungle. about Firstly, I think that there is a lot of variety in reality TV. People at home can choose which types of programme they want to watch depending on what they are interested in. Some people like watching, singang, or cooking competitions while others prefer watching programmes building houses or travelling around the world. In addition, reality TV programmes are a great opportunity to discover talented singers, dancers, or chefs. Several people who take part in these programmes get jobs as a results being on TV. Another advantage is that the people on the shows have interesting experiences and meet new people. On the other hand, some people think that reality TV is an easy way for them to become famous. However, most succesful singers, actors or chefs have worked hard all their lives and are good at their job because of their bardwork. Also, sometimes the people on the shows have to do really difficult or dangerous things. The competitions are very hard and there is only one winner. Another disadvantage is that some programmes always follow the same format and this can be boring to watch. To sum up, I think that reality TV is a good entertainment. There is a lot of variety which means there is something for everyone and they are interesting to watch. What is being talked about in the text? Do you agree/disagree with this?
