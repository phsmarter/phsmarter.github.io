                                            “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</a>

                            1. claim of policy and claim of value essay about natural resources ​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>A <strong>claim of policy essay</strong> about natural resources could <strong>argue for specific actions that need to be taken to conserve or manage these resources</strong>. On the other hand, a <strong>claim of value essay</strong> would make an <strong>argument about the inherent worth or importance of natural resources</strong>.</p><p></p>Claim of policy essay:<p>Natural resources are finite and valuable, and it is our responsibility to ensure that they are conserved and managed sustainably for future generations. To achieve this goal, we must take action to reduce waste, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable development practices.</p><p></p><p>One way to reduce waste is to implement more efficient technologies that use natural resources more judiciously. For example, we can encourage the development of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power to reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources like coal and oil. We can also promote the use of recycled materials to reduce waste and conserve natural resources.</p><p></p><p>To protect ecosystems, we must ensure that human activities do not cause irreversible harm to biodiversity and natural habitats. This requires careful planning and management of land use, as well as the establishment of protected areas and wildlife corridors. Additionally, we must work to mitigate the impact of climate change on ecosystems, which threatens to cause widespread extinction of plant and animal species.</p><p></p><p>Finally, to promote sustainable development practices, we must prioritize the use of natural resources in ways that are equitable and do not harm future generations. This requires a shift in the way we think about economic growth and development, moving away from short-term gains and towards long-term sustainability.</p><p></p>Claim of value essay:<p>Natural resources are invaluable treasures that provide essential services to humanity and support all life on earth. They are the foundation of our existence, providing us with food, water, energy, and materials for shelter, clothing, and medicine. Natural resources also provide recreational and aesthetic value, enriching our lives and connecting us to nature.</p><p></p><p>However, despite their immense value, natural resources are often taken for granted and exploited without regard for their long-term sustainability. This leads to a loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, and depletion of finite resources.</p><p></p><p>It is essential that we recognize and appreciate the inherent value of natural resources, not just in terms of their economic worth but also in terms of their ecological and social importance. We must protect and conserve these resources for their own sake, as well as for the sake of future generations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, we must shift away from an exploitative and extractive mindset towards a more holistic and sustainable approach to resource management. This requires a fundamental change in our values and attitudes towards nature, recognizing that natural resources are not commodities to be consumed and discarded but rather gifts to be treasured and stewarded responsibly.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Claim of Policy: Natural resources should be managed in a sustainable manner to ensure their availability for future generations.</p><p></p><p>Claim of Value: Natural resources are invaluable and should be treated with respect and care.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>(essay)</p><p></p><p>Natural resources are the materials and energy sources that exist naturally within the environment. They include air, water, sunlight, soil, minerals, plants, and animals. Natural resources are essential for human survival and development. They provide us with food, shelter, clothing, fuel, and other materials necessary for our daily lives.</p><p></p><p>Natural resources are finite in nature; they cannot be replaced once they have been used up or destroyed. This means that it is important to use them responsibly and sustainably so that future generations can benefit from them as well. We must also take steps to protect natural resources from pollution and other forms of degradation. This includes reducing our consumption of natural resources by using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power instead of fossil fuels. Additionally, we should strive to reduce waste by recycling and reusing materials whenever possible.</p><p></p><p>The conservation of natural resources is essential for the health of our planet and its inhabitants. By taking steps to protect these valuable resources now, we can ensure that future generations will have access to them for years to come.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Japanese culture is quite harmonious, respectful, and hardworking. Their culture is made up highly of being respectful of others, family, and nature. They value their elders, history, tradition, religion, family, government, nature, education, and work. Japanese value respect and their reputation. It is very important for them to save face in their society. For example, The japanese believe that if they turn down someone’s request, it causes embarrassment on themselves and they lose reputation. If they cannot agree to a request, often they will say “it will be difficult” or “it’s under consideration.” instead of flat out denying the request. Harmony is also one of the things that influence Japanese manners and customs.</p><br />

                            8. “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. According to the essay, the basis of national strength is the character of its citizenry. The author believes that a nation cannot be stronger than its parts, and its weakness is its failings, while its strength is its power. I partially agree with this statement because the citizenry's character is a crucial factor in a nation's strength, but it is not the only one. Factors such as the government, economy, and social structures contribute to a nation's strength.</p><p></p><p>2. The peaks, valleys, and deep chasms that could hinder the upward climb of humanity are the obstacles that prevent people from realizing their full potential, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, and conflicts. These obstacles hinder progress and development, requiring potent social upheavals.</p><p></p><p>3. The author wants the Filipinos to be solid and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning, or the storm, and confident of their strength. The author also wants the Filipino to be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited, and imbued with good patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness. I believe this goal can be achieved with proper education, training, and social support.</p><p></p><p>4. To achieve the author's perceived goal, we must possess self-discipline, courage, industry, self-reliance, purposefulness, patriotism, social ideals, and solid moral fibers. These values will enable us to develop our resources, advance our culture, promote social justice, and secure happiness and contentment for all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.</p><br />
