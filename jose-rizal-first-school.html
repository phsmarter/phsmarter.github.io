It has mountains, valleys, and fields rich with crops and minerals. It has rivers, waterfalls, and seas abundant in fish and precious sea products. It abounds in enchanting beaches, caves, and tourists' spots. It is no wonder that the Philippines is called the "Pearl of the Orient Seas." 12. The apple orchard was beautiful on the spring morning. Tiny white blossoms dotted the trees. The green grass sparkled with dew. Mist drifted against the faraway mountains. 13. Heavy rains can become a big problem for streams, Pollutants and soil are carried into streams. This can harm fish and other living creatures.

It is because of lack of physical activity in large segments of the population. In addition to healthier healthy habits, one solution would be to exercise in a daily basis. 16. During their time, Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio did good things for the Filipinos and for our country. Our heroes were once children like you. When Andres was a little boy, his parents did so he took care of his younger brothers and sisters. As a little boy, Jose Rizal used his time wisely by writing poems, stories, and playlets. 17. We had a great time on the raft ndel The ride begins with a walk up a double flight of stairs. Then, riders wait until a raft comes up the conveyor belt. A lifeguard helps people onto the raft, Once the green light comes on, all it takes is push to get the raft sliding into the deep, dark tunnel. After sliding through a few twists and turns, the raft emerges back into the light and riders find themselves in a small pool - and ready to go again! 18. Dogs are often called as man's best friend. The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with best friendships, was fomed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. People are of great value to dogs too. Dogs that live with people usually have easier access to food and safer place to stay than they would their own, and that truly is what friends are for. 19. Writing names in a smooth bark can harm a tree. Diseases can attack the tree through the cuts in the bark. Trees can die because of these diseases. 20. Many children in the city go to school. They ride buses or jeepneys. Some ride in cars or taxis. Along the way, children see many people. They see many houses and tall buildings. They sometimes feel uncomfortable because of the warm weather. They hear the loud sounds of the vehicles around. Ohl How noisy it is in the big city!​</a>

THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

                                            1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mange</p><p>- They are the succulent, aromatic fruits of an evergreen tree (Mangifera indica), a member of the cashew family (Anacardiaceae) of flowering plants. Botanically, mango is a drupe, consisting of an outer skin, a fleshy edible portion, and a central stone enclosing a single seed – also called stone fruit, like a plum, cherry, or peach</p><p>-1. Mangoes may help whittle your middle.
</p><p>
</p><p>They may seem more like a decadent dessert than a healthy fruit, but mangoes are diet-friendly. Because they’re naturally sweet, eating them can help quash your cravings for candy or other sugary foods. A one-cup serving of fresh mango has 100 calories, and because that same serving has three grams of filling fiber, you’ll feel fuller on fewer calories. In fact, mangoes are 83% water by weight, and research from Penn State University has shown that eating foods that have a high water content (and lower energy density) help to keep you fuller while eating less. In fact, one of their studies found that eating a piece of fruit before a meal reduced the calories consumed at that meal by 15 percent.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            13. Guys patulong po kung paano pa gawan ng maikling report about sa topic na to?          HISTORY O. THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

                            14. 1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *
