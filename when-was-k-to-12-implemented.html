                                            K to 12 is a kind of educational foundation where you can hone your talents and skills. It provides additional knowledge to students who have graduated from junior high school. K to 12 education,preparing children for adult responsibilities, these will be a preparation when we are able to take a course in college.Others who have graduated k to 12 can get a job, such as others who do not have enough money to take the desired course in college, so others prefer to study up to k to 12 only.Critics say that its implementation could only worsen the issue on education in the country. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (Reyes, 2015). Though some people cannot see its relevance, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.The students are more concerned about this, they are having a hard time going to junior high school because of the lack of money, it is even more difficult for the student to choose a strand because of the thought of whether they will have more difficulty here Or not? extended they are still studying instead of graduating and can find a good job. K to 12 is one of the most important aspects implemented in education, because it is not only here that the talent and talent of a student can be honed but also that you manage properly how to do it.pa summarize naman po nito plss kaylangan lang​</a>

                                            Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</a>

                            3. K to 12 is a kind of educational foundation where you can hone your talents and skills. It provides additional knowledge to students who have graduated from junior high school. K to 12 education,preparing children for adult responsibilities, these will be a preparation when we are able to take a course in college.Others who have graduated k to 12 can get a job, such as others who do not have enough money to take the desired course in college, so others prefer to study up to k to 12 only.Critics say that its implementation could only worsen the issue on education in the country. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (Reyes, 2015). Though some people cannot see its relevance, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.The students are more concerned about this, they are having a hard time going to junior high school because of the lack of money, it is even more difficult for the student to choose a strand because of the thought of whether they will have more difficulty here Or not? extended they are still studying instead of graduating and can find a good job. K to 12 is one of the most important aspects implemented in education, because it is not only here that the talent and talent of a student can be honed but also that you manage properly how to do it.pa summarize naman po nito plss kaylangan lang​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>K to 12 is an educational program that provides additional knowledge and skills to students who have completed junior high school. It prepares them for adult responsibilities and further education or job opportunities. Critics believe that the program worsens educational issues due to inadequate resources. However, K to 12 provides better education quality, job opportunities, and prepares the country for ASEAN integration. Students face challenges, such as financial constraints and difficulty choosing a strand, but K to 12 helps in managing and honing their talents.</p><br />

The qualitative research design that can be used to study the lives of the Aboriginal people in Australia is ethnography. Ethnography is a method of research that involves observing and interacting with a specific group of people to understand their culture, beliefs, and behaviors.</p><p>2. The qualitative research design that can be used to describe the implementation of K-12 among kindergarten pupils in Brgy. Pembo, Makati City is case study. A case study is an in-depth analysis of a specific case or situation to understand its complexities and unique characteristics.</p><p>3. The research topic "Most Profitable Recipe: The Best Wintermelon Milk Tea Recipes from 200 Local Milk Tea Shop" is not an appropriate research topic for qualitative research because it is more suited for quantitative research. Quantitative research involves collecting numerical data to analyze and draw conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Activity #2</p><p>1. The statement "Purposive sampling chooses its sample based on the idea of using referrals" is incorrect. Purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling technique that involves selecting participants based on a specific purpose or criteria relevant to the research study, rather than relying on chance or randomness. Referral sampling, on the other hand, involves participants being referred to the researcher by other participants.</p><p>2. The statement "A non-probability sampling technique, by other respondents to locate other members of the population" is not a complete statement and is unclear. It is difficult to determine which sampling technique is being referred to without additional context.</p><br />

                            8. Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />
