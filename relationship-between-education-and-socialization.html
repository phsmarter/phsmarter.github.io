He argued that the purpose of education is not just to acquire knowledge, but to use that knowledge to improve society.John Dewey - Dewey believed in experiential learning, where students acquire knowledge about the world through the senses, learning by doing and by interacting with the environment. He argued that students learn best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.Paulo Freire - Freire believed that teachers should lead society rather than follow it. He argued that teachers are agents of change and should work to promote social justice and equality.Paulo Freire - Freire believed that a democratic relationship between the teacher and her students is necessary in order for the conscientization process to take place. Conscientization is the development of critical consciousness, where students become aware of the social, political, and economic forces that shape their lives.Paulo Freire - Freire believed that education and literacy are the vehicle for social change. He argued that humans must learn to resist oppression and not become its victims, nor oppress others. To do so requires dialogue and critical consciousness, the development of awareness to overcome domination and oppression.John Dewey - Dewey believed that children are socially active human beings who want to explore their environment and gain control over it. He argued that education should be child-centered and focused on the needs and interests of the student.George Counts - Counts was a social reconstructionist who believed in the importance of equality or equity in both society and education. He argued that barriers of socio-economic class and racial discrimination should be eradicated.George Counts - Counts believed that schools should become instruments for social improvement rather than an agency for preserving the status quo. He argued that schools should work to promote social justice and equality.John Dewey - Dewey believed that simple ideas become more complex through comparison, reflection, and generalization- the inductive method. He argued that students should be encouraged to think critically, to question assumptions, and to draw conclusions based on evidence.Herbert Spencer - Spencer believed in Social Darwinism, which is the application of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to human societies. He argued that individual competition leads to social progress, and that only the fittest survive.<p></p><p></p><br />
