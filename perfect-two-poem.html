                                            Mr. Purey’s Lab
by Leah Joy A. Desamparado
Inside the lab, I always do a great job. Everything is in the right corner and always in order.
I never mixed one that is different from the other.
As you enter the room, all is perfect, not a single clutter.
A red cabinet can be seen on the other side of the corner Where another pure substance, a compound is placed in there It can be broken down into simple type of matter, Composed of atoms of elements two or more bonded together. It has unique properties different from its individual origins Chlorine a poisonous gas when combine to sodium.
A shiny metal turn into a table salt which in cooking food is very fundamental.
Now everything is a mess Elements and compounds all over the places Can you help me sort them out?
And organize all of them without any doubt. I am an Iron, made up of a single atom Where do I belong?

Is it in the blue cabinet or somewhere between rust, salt, and alcohol? I am a water, made up of hydrogen and oxygen
They say I am a compound
If you agree, in the red cabinet is where I should be.
You just made a good job!
An apprentice I never had
Always bear in mind
There are two types of substance inside my lab
The simplest matter is the element.
And a compound that can be broken down into its components.
