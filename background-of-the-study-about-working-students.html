                                            Practical Research
A research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those.

Directions: Identify Pautasso's suggested ten rules in writing a literature review: Write the answer on the space provided before the number. a 1. The topic must be a well-defined topic that is interesting to you and your readers. 2. Reading other literature reviews from other papers may give you other literature to read and gain information from. 3. It is recommended that you read articles first before starting your literature review so that you could make sense of what the literature says of your chosen topic. This helps you organize the ideas you have read and helps you avoid irrelevant and confusing statements. 4. This has been covered in the previous modules. Choosing the kind of literature review you wish to write will help you structure your sentences and ideas into one coherent form. -5. While you are making the literature review to find answers to your chosen topic or research problem, you can also discuss similar or related issues through it. 6. It is not enough that you summarize the literature you read, try to understand how it differs from the setting and background of the study you are pursuing. Take note of what it lacked or the aspects which can be improved through your own study. 7. In order for a literature review to make sense, it must follow not only a chronological progression of ideas but also of a logical progression. Discuss the problem from its probable causes, continuing on to the current understanding and present solutions for it. After that, you can present your view or proposed solution. _8. Try having a fellow student read your literature review and see if it makes sense to him or her. The reader can point out places where the review has become confusing and thus needs improvement. 9. If you have made research at the same field before, you can cite your own work. However, be careful not to place too much emphasis on your previous research make it seem as it is more important than other sources that you collected. 10. Older studies give a perspective on the problem during a different tim setting. Studying them together with modern studies about the topic help us see how the understanding on tl hangod over time​pa help nmn po | pa sagot ng ayos thank u</a>

                            4. Practical Research
A research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those. 
What can you say about the findings of the conducted research of Torrendo?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Finding a good topic is essential to producing quality research output. This can be difficult for student researchers, who may lack the background knowledge to identify good topics. Additionally, time management is crucial for research papers. Student researchers may have difficulty focusing on their work if they are preoccupied with other things. Lastly, having access to media devices can improve research output. However, not all student researchers have their own media devices. The findings of the Torrendo study suggest that these factors can influence the quality of student research output.</p><p></p><br />

                            8. research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those.      1.What can you say about the findings of the conducted research of Torrendo? ​</h2><br />
