                        <p>It is rightly said, “Miracles start to happen when you give as much energy to your dreams as you do to your fears”. Dreams are essential. It is only when you dream big with all your heart you will be able to achieve big. As students our dream is to achieve good marks, have good friends, get support from the family and make it big in life.</p><p></p><p>Just like others, I have also nurtured a career dream from an early age. I aspire to become a famous writer and wish to write and publish a novel one day. I have never been very good when it came to verbal communication. It is embedded in my nature. I do not like to be blunt or impolite even when someone says something to me.</p><p></p><p>I choose to remain quiet during such situations. It is not that I cannot reply back, as mentioned “I choose” to do so as I am a peace-loving person. I am also a bit of an introvert and do not like opening up with everyone. However, it is not good to pent up feelings and emotions as it can lead to stress and drain you emotionally.</p><p></p><p>I always felt an urge to shout out loud and get rid of these feelings when I was alone and soon figured out that a good way to vent these is through writing. I began writing and found out that I am actually good at it. It is hard for me to communicate my feelings verbally however it is quite easy for me to pin them down. Writing for me has now become a way of life I keep journaling all my feelings and this keeps me sorted. It has become more of a passion for me and I now aspire to turn it into my profession.</p><p></p><p>Apart from writing bits and pieces about the happenings in my life, I also love writing stories and will soon come up with my own novel. My family is completely supportive of my career dream.</p><p></p><p>Hope it's help</p><p>pa brainliest po</p><br />

                        <p> "My Personal Financial Goals in Life"</p><p></p><p>Figuring out where you will be financially years from now is hard to imagine. There are always what you plan, and then there’s things that just happen that you would usually rather not have of. You can always make goals and things and hope that things go alright and end up close to what you expected. </p><p>I am currently eighteen years old. I am working on setting up all my financial things so that I am independent and can rely on myself for what I need and not have to worry about having my parents approving of things and being responsible for what I choose to do. I am going to take out a small loan soon and work on building up my credit history. I am also planning on transferring all my things like my car and phone to my name. This summer I…show more content…</p><p>I will then purchase my own house and also a car. I will be paying insurance on both of these items. I will work the rest of my life as a Nurse and will eventually retire at the age of 65.</p><p>Although I don’t really know how well all of this will work out and I’m sure there are probably easier ways to do all this, I don’t think I will be talking to any professionals. I think I have enough basic understanding in order to keep myself stable. Granted I will probably fall a couple of times and make a few mistakes, I’ve been taught to keep working at it and you’ll get it right eventually. I know that in order to get what you want you have to try and work really hard. I don’t believe in being handed things, whether it be money or advice or anything else. I would rather try and fail then have someone tell me what to and what not to do. </p><p> I myself believe in risks to an extent. I think they are alright as long as they are somewhat logical. I don’t believe in “jumping off a cliff with no ropes hoping to survive”. I plan on having two accounts, one checking and one savings. I will mainly work with my checking account and the savings will not be touched unless for emergencies. I will keep a minimum of a thousand dollars in my savings account, which I will be opening at a credit union since they have a slightly higher interest rate, so I will always have it. I have learned to always keep a “safe".</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Goal of My life<p>Life without a noble objective is like a ship without a rudder, yet choosing a goal is a difficult undertaking. Because nothing is good or evil; thinking alone makes anything good or bad, different people have <strong>various goals</strong> depending on their preferences. Everyone who has a seeing eye, a thinking mind, and a feeling heart has some sort of ambition.</p><p></p><p>Serving my nation is my life's <strong>biggest ambition</strong>. I am aware that this is not a simple task and that there are several methods to serve one's nation. I am aware that becoming a decent citizen would be the finest service I could provide to my nation. I might decide to become a doctor, engineer, or teacher. I may go into business or into politics. But no matter who I become, if I don't understand my rights and obligations, I won't be of any service to my nation.</p><p></p><p>Making myself an excellent citizen would thus be my first step toward achieving my life's purpose. I'll never be corrupt, and I'll never put up with other people being corrupt. I'll always treat people fairly and justly. I will always put the good of the community above my own interests in all I do. I won't push my claims if there is a conflict between my personal and societal <strong>interests</strong>. I could have a positive impact on everyone if I can live up to this ideal.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about life</p><p>brainly.ph/question/2124620</p><p>#SPJ5</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>A career can be defined as a person's progress within an occupation or series of occupations. However, a career is more than just a job, or working, or your occupation. It also includes your progress through life, your growth and development in vocational and avocational areas of life. Deciding on your initial career may present a stressful and frightening prospect. Many tend to perceive career decision-making as complex or even mysterious, only because they tend to concentrate on the outcome and overlook the decision-making and planning process. Successful career decisions are based on current and accurate information. Today, career information is abundant and easily accessible. While this is exciting and potentially helpful, it can also be overwhelming. Nevertheless, one major fact emerges from the mass of data and literature available: effective career planning is a process that involves the total person. Comprehensive career planning stresses the importance of knowing enough about your unique attributes, about specific career fields, and about your life priorities.</strong></p><p></p><br />
