                                            Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center. If you follow the three Rs - reduce, reuse, and recycle,you can help save the world's forests. varagraph.

Fausto I strongly believed that due to COVID- 19 Pandemic more people nowadays prefer to use bicycles to get from one place to another and it became the safest ride vehicle. Grade 6-English First, bicycles are environment friendly because it does not release smoke that can create air pollution. Second, it reduces the use of fuel specifically gasoline is because it is not powered by any fuel instead it is powered by the riders muscles in order for it to move. Third, it allows people to save money in their fare or fuel especially nowadays that the fare for commuters increases. Fourth, it is a safe vehicle from home to your workplace or other places you may want to go and vice versa, because you don't need to be exposed in many commuters along the way and you can breathe freely, and feel the breeze while riding on the bicycle. Fifth, you can use it for recreational activities especially when you want to explore places you haven't been before. Sixth, it can improve your muscle strength and cardio-vascular condition. Finally, it can be a good exercise specifically when you want to lose weight. To some people, they might argue that bicycles are not the safest ride and are unserviceable specifically in carrying packages and other loads, but when you think of a good idea, like putting a basket, adding racks or panniers to the bicycle you can be amaze about the capability to carry the loads. People would also look wonderful riding the two-wheel vehicle feeling the breeze and it can help save our planet. Discussion Questions: 1. What is the persuasive essay all about? 2.

                                            deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. they clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. they also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. in the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. one solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. if you use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. how can you use less paper? one answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. a second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. the backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. a final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. most schools, offices, and districts have recycling center. if you follow the three rs – reduce, reuse, and recycle –, you can help save the world’s forests

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>The air we breathe, the soil we live on, the trees which give us oxygen along with other flora and fauna on the earth all constitute the environment. It would have been impossible to survive on the earth had we not had such a supportive environment. However, with the surge in the urbanisation over the last few years we have seen a steady decline in the quality of the environment around us.</p><p></p><p>“Save environment” should be the priority of each and every person today. Environment constitutes the entire surroundings comprising water, air, sunlight, plants, animals, etc., that offer viable conditions for development and growth.</p><p></p><p>Reasons to Save Environment:</p><p></p><p>It is important to save environment as life of living beings is completely dependent on it. Humans utilize the water for drinking, air for breathing and also use other natural resources for their regular everyday jobs. In fact, the food we consume like milk, eggs, and vegetables, etc., are also derived from animals and plants, which is provided to us by the environment around us.</p><p></p><p>How to Save Environment:</p><p></p><p>Environment can be saved by planting more trees, recycling, reusing, reducing pollution, creating awareness through environmental programs, etc.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>If we want to save the environment then, we should stop the exploitation of natural resources. Using these resources cautiously is very important to save the environment.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>Throwing trash improperly and inefficiently is harmful to the environment, it kills fish, trees and animals. Killing those animals, fish and trees would kill our environment and eventually end up on destroying the earth. That is why we need to start recycling. Recycling uses paper, cardboard and plastic. Since we can make things with those materials, we must recycle to keep our environment safe, we also need to replant more trees. We also need to stop cutting those trees down as it helps us with global warming, protecting those trees will protect us.

Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center.

Fausto I strongly believed that due to COVID- 19 Pandemic more people nowadays prefer to use bicycles to get from one place to another and it became the safest ride vehicle. Grade 6-English First, bicycles are environment friendly because it does not release smoke that can create air pollution. Second, it reduces the use of fuel specifically gasoline is because it is not powered by any fuel instead it is powered by the riders muscles in order for it to move. Third, it allows people to save money in their fare or fuel especially nowadays that the fare for commuters increases. Fourth, it is a safe vehicle from home to your workplace or other places you may want to go and vice versa, because you don't need to be exposed in many commuters along the way and you can breathe freely, and feel the breeze while riding on the bicycle. Fifth, you can use it for recreational activities especially when you want to explore places you haven't been before. Sixth, it can improve your muscle strength and cardio-vascular condition. Finally, it can be a good exercise specifically when you want to lose weight. To some people, they might argue that bicycles are not the safest ride and are unserviceable specifically in carrying packages and other loads, but when you think of a good idea, like putting a basket, adding racks or panniers to the bicycle you can be amaze about the capability to carry the loads. People would also look wonderful riding the two-wheel vehicle feeling the breeze and it can help save our planet. Discussion Questions: 1. What is the persuasive essay all about? 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Protecting the environment is of utmost importance to ensure a sustainable future for our planet. Adjectives and adverbs can help us describe the urgency of the situation and the importance of taking action. The first step towards saving the environment is to recognize the severity of the problem. The reckless exploitation of natural resources has led to irreversible damage to our environment. The earth is suffering from the consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the loss of biodiversity. It is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the effects of human activities on the environment. We need to adopt eco-friendly habits and promote sustainable practices to preserve the planet for future generations.</p><p></p><p>To save the environment, we must take collective responsibility and work towards creating a greener future. It is crucial that we reduce our carbon footprint by using renewable sources of energy and minimizing waste production. We can also opt for eco-friendly modes of transportation, such as cycling or using public transport, to reduce emissions from vehicles. By making small changes to our lifestyle, we can make a significant impact on the environment. Moreover, it is essential to raise awareness about the importance of environmental conservation among the younger generation. We must educate them about the consequences of environmental degradation and inspire them to take action to protect the planet. With concerted efforts, we can create a sustainable future for our planet and ensure that it remains a beautiful and healthy place for generations to come.</p><br />

                            16. Essay about producing new scientist through innovations, competitions and inventions for the sustainability for clean and green environment to save mother earth.</h2><br />
                        <p>The making of a scientists often involves finishing at least a four-year degree from a tertiary education institution. Most of the time, students are immersed in books and lectures. What if we can <strong>produce new scientists through innovations, competitions, and inventions to guarantee the sustainability of a clean and green environment and thus saving mother earth?
</strong></p><p>Learning is never only about reading books; it is also about being motivated to remember and practice an information, concept, or skill. If students simply memorize theories from books, chances are they would forget this, and by the time they need it for actual use, they will have to review and thus waste time. An innovative way of making new scientists would mean straying away from the usual lecture and notes methods and moving to new methods like experiential learning. <strong>Producing new scientists through innovations </strong>can be tricky and doing so requires teachers to be creative enough to figure out new methods to educate students. However, this is important because the environment in which students grow and develop influences how they turn out, so if they are trained in an innovative manner, they are likely to be innovative.  </p><p>Similarly, when students are pitched against each other to compete, they are often motivated to do their best. Of course, who would say no to a quiz contest with an exemption in the final exam as a reward? However, while many students are motivated by competition, John Shindler (2009) in his book Transformative Classroom Management notes that makes learners focus on the outcome and not on the process; it also weakens the intrinsic motivation of students not to mention it increases anxiety. Worse, Shindler notes that it develops ‘fear of failure’ in students. This would not be a good quality for scientists since they should go through a series of failed experiments before they arrive at the appropriate outcome. Hence, in developing new scientists, competition may help in teamwork, but too much of it could be dangerous to the individual.  </p><p>In learning, assessment is the most important. The most common forms of assessments would be written exams. However, if we are breeding scientists, practical ones in which they apply what they have so far learned would be a guarantee of their potentials. An invention would be a suitable form of assessment. They must be able to put together something functional to prove that all their years of learning have not been put into waste.
</p><p>Since we are breeding innovative, competitive, and inventive new scientists, we are given hope that the environment could be saved by this new blood of scientists. Exposing them at a young age to the value of protecting the environment will help them focus on agendas related to sustainability of  a clean and green environment. Hence, part of the innovative ways of teaching them would be best related to preserving the environment. They may be asked to compete on topics related to the environment. Finally, they may be asked to invent something for the environment. If such information is gradually implanted in them from a young age, students would grow with much concern for the environment, and these new scientists leave the institution ready to save mother earth.  </p><p>The new scientists bred through innovation, competition, and invention, could easily show <strong>how science could save humanity </strong>and mother earth.  </p><p>Read Related Topics

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>      Fuel is very important for everyday activities. Day-by-day our fuel deposits are depreciating. We need to save fuel to have a better environment around us. The real danger in consuming fuel thoughtlessly is that it is drying up the earth’s resources. Fossil fuels like coal and oil and gas are non-renewable resources. Increasing usage is depleting their presence within the earth. To save our environment, we need to save fuel.</p><p>      In today's world fuels are undoubtedly ruling our world.  Our basic needs are  Roti, Kapada and Makaan.  And, we need fuel to cook, to manufacture fabric, to produce building material and to build our sweet homes.  So willingly or unwillingly we are dependent on fuels to live. </p><p></p><p>     We use fossil fuels such as coal, wood, natural gas, Petroleum and its derivatives like petrol, diesel, LPG, kerosene etc.  Since the days of Industrial revolution, there has been a rapid growth and development in the entire globe.  The machines in industries, transport vehicles and domestic appliances all use fossil fuels.  Even though the world adopted electricity as a source of energy, we still need fossil fuels to produce electricity. </p><p>     </p><p>      Environment is an essential part of our life.  It includes surrounding water, air, trees, wildlife, birds, minerals etc.  Quality of our life depends on the quality of our environment.  Our health is dependent both on ourselves and our environment.  We need a clean environment to live healthy. </p><p> </p><p>     Last four decades have seen tremendous growth in electric and electronic gadgets and appliances causing the demand for energy to go skyrocketing.  Combustion of fossil fuels results in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that have negative impact on environment and health.
