Read it andanalyze how the writer expressed his opinion.Are video games a good way to keep filt?Nowadays, many teenagers have got video consoles at home and they oftenlike playing active video games. These are good for you for a number of reasons.First of all, I think that active video games are a good way to keep fic. Thereare a lot of different types of exercise you can do such as basketball, water-skiingand dance and, what's more, you can play them in the comfort of your own home.In my opinion, these games are fun and interactive because you can play them withfriends and, if you play online, you don't need to be in same place as your friend toplay.In addition, you can play them whenever you want. Some people think thatit's better to do exercise outside in the fresh air. Although this is true, it's actuallydifficult to play outside when it's raining or very hot so videos game are a goodalternative.To sum-up, I believe that video games are fun and social way to keep fit. Ithink they are good option when you can't play outside and they might encouragepeople to do more exercise.Guide Questions:1. What did the author say about video games?2. What are his reasons or justifications?3. How did he introduce his ideas?​</a>

                                            A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer: Philippine Theatrical</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Theater is an art form that involves live performance before an audience. It has a rich history and has evolved over time, resulting in various theatrical forms and elements. In the Philippines, theater has its unique characteristics and forms that reflect the country's culture and identity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the most popular theatrical forms in the Philippines is the "Sarswela." Sarswela is a type of musical drama that combines elements of Western theater, music, and dance with Filipino culture and traditions. It originated in the 19th century and was a popular form of entertainment during the Spanish colonial period. Sarswelas often tell stories of love, betrayal, and social issues, and they are typically performed in Tagalog.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another form of theater in the Philippines is the "Komedyang Tagalog." This form of theater is a comedy that is performed in Tagalog. Komedyang Tagalog often features slapstick humor, satire, and social commentary. It is a popular form of entertainment in the Philippines and has been around since the early 20th century.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The "Komedya" is another form of theater in the Philippines that is based on the Spanish comedia. It features a mix of music, dance, and drama and is usually performed during religious festivals. The Komedya often tells stories of good versus evil and features characters such as the hero, the villain, and the damsel in distress.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Apart from these traditional forms, there are also contemporary theatrical forms in the Philippines. One of these is the "Performance Art," which is a form of live art that involves the artist's body as the medium. It is often used to convey social and political messages and is popular among contemporary artists.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In terms of theatrical elements, there are several that are common in different forms of theater. One of these is the "dialogue," which is the exchange of words between characters. Dialogue is important in conveying the story and the characters' emotions and thoughts. Another important element is the "stage design," which includes the set, lighting, and props. Stage design is essential in creating the atmosphere and mood of the performance and can enhance the audience's experience.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In terms of example plays, there are several notable works in Philippine theater. One of these is the Sarswela "Walang Sugat" by Severino Reyes, which tells the story of a young couple's tragic love story during the Philippine revolution against Spain. Another is the Komedyang Tagalog "Bakit Buhay ang Mamatayang Tao" by Severino Reyes, which satirizes the Filipino obsession with death. The Komedya "Florante at Laura" by Francisco Balagtas is also a notable work that tells the story of a young prince's journey to find true love amidst political turmoil.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, theater is an important form of art that reflects the culture and identity of a nation. In the Philippines, theater has evolved into different forms, each with its unique characteristics and elements. From traditional forms like the Sarswela and Komedya to contemporary forms like Performance Art, Philippine theater continues to thrive and reflect the country's diverse culture and identity.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope this helps</p><p></p><br />

These are good for you for a number of reasons.First of all, I think that active video games are a good way to keep fic. Thereare a lot of different types of exercise you can do such as basketball, water-skiingand dance and, what's more, you can play them in the comfort of your own home.In my opinion, these games are fun and interactive because you can play them withfriends and, if you play online, you don't need to be in same place as your friend toplay.In addition, you can play them whenever you want.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>However, it is essential to note that academic writing and literary writing are two distinct types of writing.</p><p></p><p>Academic writing is a type of writing that is formal and organized, commonly used in universities, colleges, and scholarly publications. Academic writing focuses on presenting ideas and research in a clear, concise, and logical way, while providing credible sources to support arguments. This type of writing is usually objective, and facts are presented in a way that is free from personal opinions or biases. Examples of academic writing include research papers, theses, dissertations, and academic articles.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, literary writing is a type of writing that is artistic and creative in nature and often explores topics such as human experiences, emotions, and relationships. Literary writing aims to engage readers emotionally and intellectually, using figurative language, imagery, and symbolism to convey meaning. Examples of literary writing include novels, poetry, plays, and essays.</p><p></p><p>Through examining various examples of text types, you will be able to classify them based on their characteristics and understand the difference between academic and literary writing. This will help you recognize the specific purpose and intended audience of different writing styles, therefore improving your overall understanding of various types of writing.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the distinction between academic and literary writing is crucial in developing your writing skills. By being able to differentiate between the two, you can determine the appropriate writing style to use for specific tasks, which can help you meet the expectations of your audiences effectively.</p><p></p><br />

                            23. A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</h2><br />
