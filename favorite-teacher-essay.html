                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>My most favorite teacher is my Mathematics teacher. He is patient and because he knows his subject is difficult, he really gives us a long time to study everything. In addition, he provides examples to make our lesson easier. He was also easy to approach when we had questions. On the other hand, my most hated teacher is my Physics subject teacher. Seems like he always has a problem and doesn’t always smile. We think of him all as “terror”. But just because a teacher doesn’t smile, it does not mean that he is a bad person. Not because he is always angry that he is no longer kind. We must always remember that each person is going through something in their life that we do not know. So let's be good and be kind to everyone.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A descriptive paragraph provides a vibrant experience for the reader through vivid language and descriptions of something. Unlike narrative paragraphs, which must include personal thoughts, feelings, and growth, descriptive paragraphs do not need to be personal in nature. Instead, descriptive paragraphs must focus on vividly and objectively describing something to the reader. In order to provide this vivid detail, the writer must use language that appeals to the reader’s five senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch. To appeal to these senses, the writer must use descriptive language, usually in the form of adjectives, that describes the sensations felt by the senses. For instance, examine the differences between the descriptions below:Sentence 1: The tree was tall and green.Sentence 2: The soft and damp pink flowers of the dogwood tree smelled sweet in the cool spring air as the wind whistled through its yellow-green leaves.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>plss </strong></p><p><strong>na </strong><strong>banned </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>kasi acc </strong><strong>ko</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Teacher Anne really likes the penmanship of Joseph. It is neat and clear. She gives him high scores in his essays without reading them.</p><p><strong>Type of Bias: </strong><strong>Halo Effect </strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Halo Effect is a bias wherein good appearances or impressions are perceived as superior or better without further examining the details. In this situation, the teacher is impressed by the aesthetic penmanship of Joseph and assumed that the student's writing content is also good. Teacher Anne has this impression that anything she finds pretty, good or pleasing to her eyes affects the personality or content. </p><p>The halo effect represents a bias altering the perception of people or brands. It is assimilated to the first impression capable of generating a selective perception of information. Judgment on an object or a person can then be affected.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.

If a material or source which is verified says that our beliefs are opposite or they suggest it in different way, people tend to reject it because it does not match with our beliefs. This type of bias will make people believe in fake news more because it mimics what they think instead of putting the truth as importance. </p><p></p><p>Confirmation bias is the instinctive tendency of the human mind to prioritize information that confirms its way of thinking, and to neglect anything that might challenge it.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yeah of course, I miss my school, as well as my teachers, classmates, and especially my friends, because there was a time when we did an activity with our E.S.P. teacher in which we shared our problems, laughed at the craziest and funniest things we did in our lives, cried together because they reminded us of the saddest moments in our lives, and also told our classmates who among them we were angry at. And we're all really relieved after that activity. After that, we're already at ease discussing our own concerns with one another. That's why I adore E.S.P.</p><br />
