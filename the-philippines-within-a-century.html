Alongside the fully-fledged islands, there are dozens of uninhabited It is a dispute over territory and sovereignty over ocean areas and the Paracels and the Spratlys - two island chains rocky outcrops, atolls, sandbanks and reefs such as the Scarborough Shoal. Who claims what? southerly province of Hainan. Beijing has said it's right to the area come from 2,000 years of history where the Paracel China claims by far the largest portion of territory - an area stretching hundreds of miles south and east from its most and Spratly island chains were regarded as integral parts of the Chinese nation. In 1947, China issued a map detailing its claims. It showed the two island groups falling entirely within its territory. Those claims are mirrored by Taiwan because the island considers itself the Republic of China and has the same territorial claims. Vietnam hotly disputes China's historical account, saying China never claimed sovereignty over the islands until 1940s. Vietnam says both island chains are entirely within its territory. It says it has actively ruled over both the Paracels and the Spratlys since the 17th century - and has the documents to prove it. The other major claimant in the area is the Philippines, which invokes its geographical proximity to the Spratly Islands as the main basis of its claim for part of the grouping. Both the Philippines and China lay claim to the Scarborough shoal (known as Huangyan Island in China) - a little more than 100 miles (160km) from the Philippines and 500 miles from China. Malaysia and Brunei also lay claim to territory in the West Philippine Sea that they say falls within their economic exclusive zone, as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982. Brunei does not claim any of the disputed islands but Malaysia claims a small number of islands in the Spratlys. According to the EIA, the real wealth of the area may well be natural gas reserve. Estimates say the area holds about 900 trillion cubic feet (25 trillion cubic meter) - the same as the proven reserves of Qatar. The area is also one of the region's main shipping lanes and is home to a fishing ground that supplies the livelihood of thousands of people. Hoe much trouble does the dispute cause? The most serious trouble in recent decades has flared between Vietnam and China. The Chinese seized the Paracels from Vietnam in 1974, killing more than 70 Vietnamese troops. In 1988 the two sides clashed in the Spratlys when Vietnam again came off worse, losing about 60 sailors. The Philippines has also been involved in a number of minor skirmishes with Chinese, Vietnamese and Malaysian forces. The most recent upsurge in tension has coincided with more muscular posturing from China. Beijing officials have issued a number of strongly worded statements including warnings their rivals to stop any mineral exploration in the area. The Philippines has accused China of building up its military preserve in the Spratlys. The two countries have engaged in a maritime stand-off, accusing each other of intrusion in the Scarborough Shoal. Chinese and Philippine vessels refuse to leave the area and tension has flared leading to rhetoric and protest. Unverified claims that the Chinese Navy deliberately sabotaged two Vietnamese exploration operations has led to larg anti-China protest on the streets of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam has held live-fire exercise off its coast- an action that was seen as a gross provocation by Beijing.

Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</a>

                            7. West Philippine Sea Dispute has sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences. Rival countries have squabbled over territory in the West Philippine Sea for centuries, but the recent upsurge in tension What is the argument about? claimed in whole or in part by a number of countries. Alongside the fully-fledged islands, there are dozens of uninhabited It is a dispute over territory and sovereignty over ocean areas and the Paracels and the Spratlys - two island chains rocky outcrops, atolls, sandbanks and reefs such as the Scarborough Shoal. Who claims what? southerly province of Hainan. Beijing has said it's right to the area come from 2,000 years of history where the Paracel China claims by far the largest portion of territory - an area stretching hundreds of miles south and east from its most and Spratly island chains were regarded as integral parts of the Chinese nation. In 1947, China issued a map detailing its claims. It showed the two island groups falling entirely within its territory. Those claims are mirrored by Taiwan because the island considers itself the Republic of China and has the same territorial claims. Vietnam hotly disputes China's historical account, saying China never claimed sovereignty over the islands until 1940s. Vietnam says both island chains are entirely within its territory. It says it has actively ruled over both the Paracels and the Spratlys since the 17th century - and has the documents to prove it. The other major claimant in the area is the Philippines, which invokes its geographical proximity to the Spratly Islands as the main basis of its claim for part of the grouping. Both the Philippines and China lay claim to the Scarborough shoal (known as Huangyan Island in China) - a little more than 100 miles (160km) from the Philippines and 500 miles from China. Malaysia and Brunei also lay claim to territory in the West Philippine Sea that they say falls within their economic exclusive zone, as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982. Brunei does not claim any of the disputed islands but Malaysia claims a small number of islands in the Spratlys. According to the EIA, the real wealth of the area may well be natural gas reserve. Estimates say the area holds about 900 trillion cubic feet (25 trillion cubic meter) - the same as the proven reserves of Qatar. The area is also one of the region's main shipping lanes and is home to a fishing ground that supplies the livelihood of thousands of people. Hoe much trouble does the dispute cause? The most serious trouble in recent decades has flared between Vietnam and China. The Chinese seized the Paracels from Vietnam in 1974, killing more than 70 Vietnamese troops. In 1988 the two sides clashed in the Spratlys when Vietnam again came off worse, losing about 60 sailors. The Philippines has also been involved in a number of minor skirmishes with Chinese, Vietnamese and Malaysian forces. The most recent upsurge in tension has coincided with more muscular posturing from China. Beijing officials have issued a number of strongly worded statements including warnings their rivals to stop any mineral exploration in the area. The Philippines has accused China of building up its military preserve in the Spratlys. The two countries have engaged in a maritime stand-off, accusing each other of intrusion in the Scarborough Shoal. Chinese and Philippine vessels refuse to leave the area and tension has flared leading to rhetoric and protest. Unverified claims that the Chinese Navy deliberately sabotaged two Vietnamese exploration operations has led to larg anti-China protest on the streets of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam has held live-fire exercise off its coast- an action that was seen as a gross provocation by Beijing. Mga Gabay na Tanong: 1. Paano nagkakatulad at nagkakaiba ang suliranin na iyong sinuri tungkol sa imperyalismo noong ika-16 hangga ika-19 na siglo? 2. Sa mga nabanggit na epekto, alin ang maituturing na pinakamasama? Pangatwiranan ang iyong sagot. 3. Alin sa mga epekto ang mga direktang kaugnayan sa kolonyalismo at imperyalismong naganap sa Asya m ika-16 hanggang ika-19 na siglo? Ipaliwanag​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.Ang pagkakatulad ng suliranin sa imperyalismo noong ika-16 hanggang ika-19 na siglo at ang kasalukuyang alitan sa West Philippine Sea ay nagmumula sa pag-aagawan ng teritoryo at soberanya. Pareho silang may kinalaman sa pagsasakop at pag-aambisyon ng mga bansa na magkaroon ng kontrol sa mga teritoryong may kahalagahan sa ekonomiya at seguridad.</p><p>Sa panahon ng imperyalismo, maraming mga bansa ang naglalayong maipatupad ang kanilang kolonyal na interes sa ibang mga lupaing nasasakupan. Sa kasong ito, ang mga bansang Europeo tulad ng Espanya at Portugal ay naghahangad ng mga kolonya upang makakuha ng mga likas na yaman at mapalawak ang kanilang impluwensya at kapangyarihan. Ang kasalukuyang alitan sa West Philippine Sea ay nagpapakita ng parehong pagnanais ng mga bansa na magkaroon ng kontrol sa likas na yaman at mga ruta ng pangangalakal sa rehiyon.</p><p></p><p>Sa kabilang banda, ang pagkakaiba ay matatagpuan sa mga aktor at pamamaraan ng pagsasakop. Noong panahon ng imperyalismo, mga bansang Europeo ang mga pangunahing mapangahas na naghahangad ng kolonya. Ngayon naman, ang mga bansang tulad ng China, Vietnam, at Pilipinas ang aktibong nakikipag-agawan ng mga teritoryo sa West Philippine Sea. Ang mga pamamaraan ng pagsasakop ay nag-iba rin dahil sa pagkakaroon ng internasyonal na batas at mga mekanismo ng diplomasya na dapat sundin.</p><p></p><p>2.Sa mga nabanggit na epekto, ang pinakamasamang maaaring maituring ay ang potensyal na pagkakaroon ng isang armadong tunggalian o digmaan sa rehiyon. Ang tensiyon at labanan para sa kontrol sa West Philippine Sea ay nagdadala ng malaking banta sa seguridad at kapayapaan hindi lamang sa mga bansang direktang sangkot, kundi maaari rin itong makaapekto sa rehiyonal na kasunduan at relasyon ng iba pang mga bansa.</p><p>Ang pagkakaroon ng armadong tunggalian ay magdudulot ng pinsala sa buhay ng mga kawani ng militar, maging sa sibilyan na naapektuhan ng mga sagupaan. Bukod dito, ang digmaan ay magdudulot ng pagsisira sa ekonomiya, pagkawasak ng mga estruktura at imprastruktura, at malubhang paghihirap para sa mga mamamayan ng mga bansang apektado. Ang pinakamasamang epekto nito ay ang pagkasira ng pambansang seguridad at pagkalugmok sa kalagayan ng mga taong nabubuhay sa mga apektadong lugar.<br /><br />3.Pagsasamantala at pagsasakop ng mga kolonyal na kapangyarihan: Sa panahong ito, maraming mga bansa sa Kanluran ang nagsimulang maglayag at mangibang-bansa upang maghanap ng bagong mga ruta papuntang Asya. Ang mga bansang tulad ng Espanya, Portugal, Inglaterra, Pransiya, at Olanda ay nagtatag ng mga kolonya sa Asya upang palakihin ang kanilang kapangyarihan at kontrol sa kalakalan at yamang likas ng mga rehiyong ito.</p><p></p><p>Pag-aangkin at pagsasamantala ng mga yaman ng mga kolonya: Ang mga kolonyal na kapangyarihan ay naghanap ng mga yaman tulad ng mga pampagawa na sangkap, mga porselana, mga espesya, at iba pang likas na yaman na matatagpuan sa mga kolonya sa Asya. Ang mga ito ay nakuha at inangkin ng mga kolonyal na bansa upang mapalago ang kanilang ekonomiya at pampasikat na kalakalan.</p><br />

Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</h2><br />
