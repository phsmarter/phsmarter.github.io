EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars. It is believed that replacement of the baybayin by the Roman alphabet must have obliterated a significant aspect of indigenous Philippine literature. 1. The excerpt above is an example of a/an... A.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. "The Maguindanao Pearls" is a story set in the southern part of the Philippines, particularly in the province of Maguindanao, which is known for its rich culture and traditions. The story is set during a time when the area was ruled by the Sultanate of Maguindanao, an Islamic state that flourished from the 16th to the 19th century.</p><p></p><p>2. The story of "The Maguindanao Pearls" is a work of fiction, and while it may draw inspiration from historical events and cultural traditions, it is not entirely realistic. The story portrays a romanticized version of life in the Philippines during the Sultanate era, and some of the events and characters are exaggerated or fictionalized for the sake of storytelling.</p><p></p><p>3. The most interesting part of the story is the legend of the Maguindanao pearls themselves. The pearls are said to have magical properties that can bring good fortune and protection to their owners. The story also explores themes of love, loyalty, and sacrifice, as well as the cultural values of the Maguindanao people.</p><p></p><p>4. While the story is set in the past, some of the cultural traditions and practices depicted in the story are still observed in the Philippines today. For example, the practice of barter and trade is still common in some parts of the country, and the traditional clothing and jewelry worn by the characters in the story are still worn for special occasions.</p><p></p><p>5. "The Maguindanao Pearls" is a distinct part of Philippine literature because it showcases the rich culture and traditions of the Maguindanao people, as well as the storytelling traditions of the Philippines. The story draws on elements of Philippine folklore and mythology, as well as the country's history and cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>6. The story is deserving to be read by 21st-century learners because it offers insights into Philippine history and culture, as well as themes that are relevant to contemporary society. The story explores issues of love, loyalty, and sacrifice, which are timeless and universal themes that resonate with readers of all ages and backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>7. The story poses several challenges to the youth of today, including the need to understand and appreciate their cultural heritage, as well as the importance of valuing traditions and customs. The story also highlights the importance of loyalty and sacrifice, which are values that can inspire young people to be more selfless and compassionate in their relationships and interactions with others.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. a small village situated at the riverside.</p><p>2. for me, it's a yes. because the story reflects to our daily lives and what's happening to our society. like frustration, theft, etcs.</p><br />

EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars. It is believed that replacement of the baybayin by the Roman alphabet must have obliterated a significant aspect of indigenous Philippine literature. 1. The excerpt above is an example of a/an... A.
