                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>indigenous people</p><p>Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples or native peoples, are ethnic groups who are the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic, usually having adopted substantial elements of a colonising culture, such as dress, religion or language. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region (sedentary) or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the inherent dignity, equality, and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. The rights of all members of indigenous populations are included in this declaration. However, Indigenous Peoples also have rights as distinct cultural groups or nations. </p><p>indigenous people</p><p>Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples or native peoples, are ethnic groups who are the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently.

The rights of all members of indigenous populations are included in this declaration. However, Indigenous Peoples also have rights as distinct cultural groups or nations.</p><p>Use prewritten content</p><p>Indigenous people are people defined in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their historical ties to a particular territory, and their cultural or historical distinctiveness from other populations that are often politically dominant. The concept of indigenous people defines these groups as particularly vulnerable to exploitation, marginalization and oppression by nation states that may still be formed from the colonising populations, or by politically dominant ethnic groups. As a result</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer: A Reflection on the Lives of Indigenous People</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>It is estimated that there are approximately 370 million indigenous people living in more than 90 countries worldwide (UNESCO, 2018). Despite comprising a sizable portion of the global population, indigenous people often face discrimination and marginalized lifestyles. In many cases, indigenous people are denied basic rights and dignities, and are forcibly removed from their ancestral lands.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The situation of indigenous people is a human rights issue that deserves attention. In this essay, I will discuss the challenges faced by indigenous people, as well as some possible solutions to address these challenges.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Body</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Indigenous people often face discrimination and marginalization due to the fact that they are not members of the majority population in their respective countries. They may be seen as inferior or considered to be a burden on society. As a result, they may be denied basic rights and access to essential services.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In some cases, indigenous people are forcibly removed from their ancestral lands. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including the construction of dams or other development projects. The forced displacement of indigenous people often results in social and economic disruption, as well as cultural loss.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong> Furthermore, indigenous people are often marginalized in terms of education and employment. They may not have access to quality education, or they may be unable to find jobs that offer livable wages. This can lead to a vicious cycle of poverty and powerlessness.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>There are a number of challenges that indigenous people face. However, there are also some potential solutions to address these challenges.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One solution is to provide indigenous people with access to quality education. This can help to break the cycle of poverty and powerlessness. Additionally, it is important to create employment opportunities that offer livable wages. This will help to ensure that indigenous people are able to support themselves and their families.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another solution is to work towards the recognition of indigenous people's rights. This includes the right to self-determination, the right to their ancestral lands, and the right to cultural and linguistic expression. The recognition of these rights can help to empower indigenous people and give them a sense of control over their lives.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Indigenous people face many challenges, but there are also some potential solutions. Education and employment are two key areas that need to be addressed. Additionally, the rights of indigenous people need to be recognized. By working towards these goals, we can help to empower indigenous people and improve their quality of life. So this is my reflection about the indigenous people, I hope you understand and learn something from this essay. Good luck!!</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

It has been praised for its support for the cultural integrity of indigenous peoples, the right to their lands and the right to self-directed development of these lands.  </p><p>A more substantial implementation of the law is still sought, as the indigenous peoples of the Philippines continue to live in geographically isolated areas with lack of access to basic social services and few opportunities for widespread economic activities, education or political participation.</p><p><strong>The Igorot, the Lumad and the Mangyan</strong>
</p><p>The last census of 2010 included an ethnic variable for the first time. However, an official figure for the indigenous peoples of the Philippines has yet arrived, and it is estimated that the country's indigenous population is between 10% and 20% of the national population, which currently stands at around 102.9 million.
</p><p>
</p><p>The indigenous groups in the mountains of northern Luzon are collectively known as Igorot, while the groups on the southern island of Mindanao are collectively called Lumad. There are smaller groups collectively known as Mangyan in the central islands, and even smaller and scattered groups in the central islands and Luzon, including several groups of hunter-gatherers in transition.
</p><p>
</p><p>Indigenous peoples in the Philippines have retained much of their traditional, pre-colonial culture, social institutions and living practices. In general, they live in geographically isolated areas with lack of access to basic social services and few opportunities for major economic activities, education or political participation. In contrast, commercially valuable natural resources such as minerals, forests and rivers are found mainly in their areas, which makes them continuously vulnerable to aggression against development and land grabbing.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Main challenges for the indigenous peoples of the Philippines</strong>
</p><p>Indigenous peoples participated in the electoral process by presenting their own political party, Sulong Katribu, to represent their interests in the 2016 national elections. Their attempt to win seats in Congress through the party-list system failed not because of lack of votes, but because the Elections Commission and the Supreme Court refused to accredit Sulong Katribu to participate in the elections.
</p><p>
</p><p>The disqualification of the party list was condemned by many indigenous peoples, who filed appeals stating that all requirements for the accreditation of party lists had been met and that the disqualification of Sulong Katribu was a measure to further marginalize and discriminate against the parties. indigenous peoples. However, these appeals were also denied.
</p><p>
</p><p>KATRIBU, the national alliance of the regional organization of indigenous peoples, recorded 37 cases of extrajudicial executions of indigenous peoples, 62 illegal arrests, 21 political prisoners, 20 incidents of forced evacuation that affected 21,966 indigenous peoples, more than a hundred people faced charges, and the forced closure of 34 Lumad schools since Duterte assumed the presidency in July 2016.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Three reasons why we should all care about Indigenous Peoples<p></p><p></p><p>August 9 is the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples. Worldwide, there are about 370 million Indigenous Peoples and ethnic minorities living in more than 90 countries worldwide.</p><p></p><p></p>No matter where we live or who we are, we should all care about Indigenous Peoples. Why?<p></p>First, Indigenous Peoples and ethnic minorities are more likely to be poor.<p></p><p>Although Indigenous Peoples make up only 5% of the global population, they account for about 15% of the world’s extreme poor. They are overrepresented.</p><p></p><p>And if you’re from an indigenous family in Latin America, then you’re three times more likely to be in poverty than someone from a non-indigenous family in the same region.</p><p></p>Second, while there have been advances, Indigenous Peoples and ethnic minorities continue to face exclusion and marginalization, and lack equal access to basic services.<p></p><p>From India to Peru, indigenous women are less likely to use healthcare facilities for childbirth because of discrimination, mistreatment, and a lack of respect for cultural practices.</p><p></p><p>Indigenous Peoples’ life expectancy is up to 20 years lower than the life expectancy of non-indigenous people worldwide.</p><p>In Latin America, despite the major expansion of basic services, indigenous populations’ access to sanitation and electricity is 15% and 18% lower, respectively, than that of others in the region.</p><p></p>Third, Indigenous Peoples help protect our environment, fight climate change, and build resilience to natural disasters, yet their rights aren’t always protected.<p></p><p>While Indigenous Peoples own, occupy, or use a quarter of the world’s surface area, they safeguard 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity</p><p></p><p>Over 20% of the world’s tropical forest carbon is stored in Indigenous People’s territories in the Amazon Basin, Mesoamerica, the DRC, and Indonesia.</p><p></p><p>However, only a fraction of indigenous lands are officially recognized by states.</p><p></p><p>The year of 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p><p></p><p>It reminds us just how big the challenge remains – to secure Indigenous Peoples’ basic rights and make sure they’re included in the development process, so they have the opportunity to live safer, healthier, and more prosperous lives.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An indigenous tribe of Philippine mountain people has lived in seclusion for centuries. They have made the mountains their home and survived off the land and its bounty. </p><p></p><p>The tribe openly welcomed the modern world when it reached their doorstep a few decades ago. While they accepted the new technology, they also kept their traditional way of life intact. Their language was protected, and they welcomed outsiders and visitors with open arms.</p><p></p><p>The mountain people revere nature and all that it provides – from the fruits and vegetables they grow, to the wildlife that share their home. They live in harmony with nature and respect the laws of their ancestors. </p><p></p><p>One day, a group of environmental activists visited the tribe to learn more about their way of life. The tribe was surprised to see outsiders interested in their ways, but they willingly shared their stories and customs. The activists were inspired by what they heard and promised to help protect the tribe and their land. </p><p></p><p>Inspired by this act of kindness, the mountain people decided to give back too. They began sending monthly donations to local animal sanctuaries in the area to help preserve nature's balance. There was nothing that made them happier than knowing that they were doing their part in protecting nature's harmony, just like their ancestors taught them to do.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> <strong>HOPE </strong><strong>IT </strong><strong>HELPS </strong><strong>PA </strong><strong>BRAINLIEST </strong><strong>THANKS </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For thousands of years, indigenous people have inhabited the Philippine archipelago. These communities have developed unique cultural traditions and practices that reflect their deep connection to the land and their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Despite their rich cultural heritage, indigenous people in the Philippines have faced significant challenges in recent decades. Many have been displaced from their ancestral lands due to large-scale development projects, mining operations, and other forms of resource extraction. This displacement has led to the loss of traditional knowledge and practices, as well as social and economic marginalization.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, many indigenous communities in the Philippines continue to fight for their rights and their way of life. They have organized themselves into advocacy groups and have sought legal recognition of their rights to their ancestral lands and resources. They have also worked to preserve their cultural heritage through traditional practices, music, dance, and storytelling.</p><p></p><p>Today, there is a growing recognition of the importance of protecting the rights and cultural heritage of indigenous people in the Philippines. The government has passed laws and policies aimed at recognizing and protecting the rights of indigenous communities, and many organizations and individuals are working to support these efforts.</p><p></p><p>Through their resilience and determination, indigenous people in the Philippines continue to contribute to the cultural diversity and richness of the country, while also advocating for their rights and the protection of their ancestral lands and resources.</p><br />

                            16. Reflection of Indigenous science and technology in the Philippines </h2><br />
                        <p>Indigenous science and technology in the Philippines refers to the traditional knowledge, practices, and technologies of the country's indigenous communities, which have been developed over generations through close observation of the natural environment and the application of local knowledge and resources. These practices and technologies are deeply rooted in the cultural and spiritual beliefs of the indigenous peoples and are often closely linked to their livelihoods, social organization, and community life.</p><p></p><p>In the Philippines, the indigenous peoples comprise a significant portion of the population and are recognized by the government as distinct cultural communities with their own rights and identities. Many of these communities have developed sophisticated systems of agriculture, medicine, architecture, and crafts that are adapted to their specific ecological and cultural contexts. For example, the Ifugao people of the Cordillera region are known for their terraced rice fields, which are not only aesthetically impressive but also highly efficient in conserving water and soil and maximizing crop yields. The T'boli people of Mindanao are skilled in weaving intricate patterns from abaca fiber, while the B'laan people are known for their knowledge of medicinal plants and their use in treating various ailments.</p><p></p><p>Despite the richness and diversity of indigenous science and technology in the Philippines, it has often been marginalized and undervalued in the face of the dominant Western scientific paradigm. Indigenous knowledge and practices have been dismissed as "primitive" or "superstitious" and have often been replaced by modern technologies and ways of life that are not always compatible with local ecosystems and cultures. This has led to the erosion of traditional knowledge and practices and has resulted in the loss of biodiversity and cultural diversity.</p><p></p><p>However, in recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the value of indigenous science and technology in promoting sustainable development and cultural diversity. Many indigenous communities are now actively involved in efforts to preserve and promote their traditional knowledge and practices, and there are also initiatives to incorporate indigenous knowledge into mainstream science and education. For example, the Department of Education in the Philippines has developed a curriculum that integrates indigenous knowledge and practices into science and social studies subjects, and there are also research programs that focus on documenting and studying indigenous science and technology.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Spanish and American colonialization of the Philippines institutionalized the distinction among peoples in the country into mainstream Christian/Muslim and peripheral tribal/minority/ indigenous populations. Through laws, the tribal/ minority/indigenous communities were deprived of the right to their ancestral domains. Through so-called “development” activities, they were dispossessed of the land they till for their livelihood. Their marginalization, dispossession and other forms of injustices continued long after colonial rule had gone.</p><p>This article briefly traces the historical development of the legal measures that led to the oppression of the indigenous peoples in the Philippines, as well as discuss the current measures that address the problem. To prepare for the article, the author reviewed the major laws as well as the political systems from the colonial period to the present, and analyzed materials related to the training programs at the Northern Illinois University that contain critical reflections that arose from the focused group discussions among representatives of indigenous peoples from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao who attended the programs.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>The article examines the application of the UN Declaration on Indigenous Rights (UNDRIP) beyond the confines of a State entity. Specifically, it explores the potential integration of indigenous housing, land and property protections into an occupation setting – where sovereignty is suspended and the responsibility to protect the population’s rights is vested in an external governing power. Can and should indigenous protections be integrated into the law of occupation? What implications would that entail vis-à-vis the limits that the law of occupation imposes on the occupant to introduce new legal obligations into occupied territory? The need to address this theoretical inquiry arises from the dire conditions of indigenous Bedouin in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. Historically and culturally, the West Bank Bedouin have close ties to Bedouin within Israel, the latter acknowledged internationally as indigenous people. Therefore, arguably, the West Bank Bedouin are also entitled to indigenous protections – the relevant difference being that the latter live in occupied territory. The case study of the West Bank Bedouin offers thus a unique opportunity to examine the potential relationship between the law of occupation and the indigenous rights regime as embodied in UNDRIP.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The article examines the application of the UN Declaration on Indigenous Rights (UNDRIP) beyond the confines of a State entity.
