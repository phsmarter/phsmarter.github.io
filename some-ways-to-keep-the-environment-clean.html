                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>a. The eulogist can only remember the difficult times in the life of the deceased person.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First of all, planting trees should be given massive attention. Above all, a tree is the source of oxygen. Unfortunately, due to construction, many trees have been cut down. This certainly reduces the amount of oxygen in the environment. Growing more trees means more oxygen. Hence, growing more trees would mean better life quality.</p><p>Similarly, people must give attention to forest conservation. Forests are vital for the Environment. However, deforestation certainly reduces the area of forests around the World. The government must launch programs to conserve the forests. The government must make harming forests a criminal offense.</p><p>Soil conservation is yet another important way to save the Environment. For this, there must be control of landslides, floods, and soil erosion. Furthermore, there should also be afforestation and tree plantation to conserve the soil. Also, terrace farming and using natural fertilizers are some more ways.</p><p>Waste management is a powerful way of protecting the environment. There must be proper disposal of wastes. Most noteworthy, this would help to keep the surroundings healthy. The government must ensure to clean the streets and other polluted land areas. Furthermore, there should be toilets in every house. Also, the government must provide enough public toilets.</p><p>Pollution is probably the biggest danger to the Environment. Smoke, dust, and harmful gases cause air pollution. These causes of air pollution come from industries and vehicles mostly. Furthermore, Chemicals and pesticides cause land and water pollution.</p><p></p><br />

Recycle the materials that are recyclable in your area and make sure to reduce the likelihood of your garbage ending up in the environment by keeping a lid on your trash can when it’s outside.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.<strong> </strong><strong>Avoid products with microbeads</strong><strong>.</strong> Facial scrubs and beauty products containing plastic microbeads were banned in the United States in 2015, but won’t be fully phased out until 2019. Read the labels when purchasing products and opt for ones that contain natural scrubbing ingredients like salt or sugar.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Refuse single-use items</strong><strong>.</strong> Take note on how often you rely on single-use items and choose to replace them with more sustainable versions. Refusing plastic straws and disposable cutlery when you go out and bringing your own containers for leftovers are a few ways you can start today.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Invest in a reusable water bottle.</strong> Acquiring a reusable water bottle would not only greatly reduce the amount of single-use plastic you use, but it would also save you money in the long run! If you’re concerned about the quality of your tap water, consider using a water filter.</p><p></p><p></p><p>5. <strong>Compost.</strong> Composting at home reduces the volume of garbage sent to landfills and reduces the chance of some products becoming marine debris.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. bring ur own reusable cup</p><p>2.Compost</p><p>3.make sure ur waste go to right place/trash can</p><p>4.bring a bag</p><p>5.Avoid products with microbeads.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><p></p><br />
