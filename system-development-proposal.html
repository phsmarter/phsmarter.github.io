                                            Joseph Williams was appointed CEO of Pharaoh’s Enterprises upon the death of his Jacob. The company went public under the leadership of Joseph and had to adapt to being open and transparent to outside investors. There were pressures from the shareholders to reduce costs and increase profits. In response, Joseph implemented cost- cutting measures including downsizing by means of enforcing early retirement of employees who he felt could not cope in the move to digitize the operations of the business. As expected, most of the employees were not happy and this affected the morale of their employees. Joseph sought the assistance of Nehemiah Daniels, the VP of HR. Nehemiah suggested a comprehensive program wherein it is not just the managers who would be evaluated based on achieving results but even the employees by means of demonstrating to their employees that their performance affects company results. This in turn will show to the shareholders that the company’s primary objective is to increase performance. 1. Do you agree with the proposal of Nehemiah Daniels? Explain your answer. 2. If you were an employee of Pharaoh’s Enterprises, how would you react to the new evaluation system that will measure your performance vis-à-vis predetermined outcomes or objectives. 3. Who should be involved in developing employee outcomes/objectives? 4. How do you think the problem will be addressed using proper communication?​</a>

Evolution is defined as a gradual change over time or change in the genetic composition of a population from generation to generation.2. The present system of classification of living organisms reflects the evolution of organisms irrelevant to the evolution of other organisms since they have their own phylogeny.3. Jean Baptiste de Lamarck proposed the Theory of Natural Selection which explains that the parts of an organism that the organism uses most will undergo hypertrophy and will become more developed while the parts of the organism that are not used as much will undergo atrophy and begin to degrade from lack of use. 4. Charles Darwin believes that the rate of survival of an organism is dependent on the organism’s heritable traits suited in the environment.5. According to Charles Darwin, organisms adapt to their environment in order to evolve.​</a>

                                            The manager of a tool and die shop needs help with job processing and control. Jobs are currently processed by hand. First, a job number is established. Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is scheduled for a specific day and estimated time.
On the day, the job is to be worked on, materials orders have to be issued to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be rescheduled.
Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also used to chargeback time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed.
The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order; but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker.

                                            MANILA - A regulator has given its final approval to the proposal to develop the Wawa Dam in Rodriguez, Rizal as a new water source for the Metro Manila, the project's proponent said on Monday. WawaJVCO, the joint venture between ports magnate Enrique Razon’s Prime Infra and businessman Oscar Violago’s San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders Group, said the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System approved the Wawa Bulk Water Supply Project during the Nov. 14 meeting of the MWSS Board. The project, which is a private arrangement between Manila Water and WawaJVCo, is expected to generate at least 80 million liters per day (mld) for Manila Water by 2021, and over 500 mld by 2025. Prime Infra said it hoped to break ground on the project next year. MWSS Chairman Reynaldo Velasco said he hoped other government agencies would soon issue permits for the project. Razon first announced the project in April as water service interruptions affected large parts of Metro Manila. The project was initially approved by the MWSS in May, but still had to hurdle a legal review by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). The MWSS said the OGCC approved the project last Nov. 7. Wawa Dam used to supply the bulk of Metro Manila's water needs before Angat Dam went into service.　what do your opinion on this matters? ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>FOREWORD
</p><p>"People's participation is becoming the central issue of our time," says UNDP in its Human Development Report 1993, to which we add, "and participation requires communication".
</p><p>
</p><p>Development programmes can only realise their full potential if knowledge and technology are shared effectively, and if populations are motivated and committed to achieve success. Unless people themselves are the driving force of their own development, no amount of investment or provision of technology and inputs will bring about any lasting improvements in their living standards.
</p><p>
</p><p>Communication is central to this task in many ways. For example, it enables planners, when identifying and formulating development programmes, to consult with people in order to take into account their needs, attitudes and traditional knowledge. Only with communication will the project beneficiaries become the principal actors to make development programmes successful.
</p><p>
</p><p>Helping people at all levels to communicate empowers them to recognise important issues and find common grounds for action, and builds a sense of identity and participation in order to implement their decisions.
</p><p>
</p><p>On top of that, development involves change, new ways of doing things. Will people have the confidence to make a project work? Will they acquire the new knowledge and skills they need? How can barriers of illiteracy be overcome? Communication media and techniques can be powerful tools to advise people about new ideas and methods, to encourage adoption of those ideas and methods, and to improve training overall.
</p><p>
</p><p>Communication approaches are also invaluable for improved coordination and teamwork to manage development programmes, and to gain institutional support.
</p><p>
</p><p>We live in a communication age, and the full impact of communication on development is just starting to be seen. Based on the experience of FAO and other agencies, communication for development has reached the stage where it can have a noticeable and rewarding effect on many development programmes.
</p><p>
</p><p>This booklet not only promotes the concept of development communication but, more important, it also describes how achieving its full potential to support development requires executive decisions by national planners and policy-makers.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear [School Principal] and Student Council,</p><p></p><p>I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned student and a witness to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I would like to raise a proposal that can benefit both students and teachers alike.</p><p></p><p>It is no secret that the pandemic has changed the way we learn, and as much as we wish to return to traditional classroom learning, we cannot disregard the importance of technology in education. With this in mind, I would like to suggest the development or adoption of an online learning management system that can track student progress and compliance.</p><p></p><p>This system can feature self-learning modules, which can be accessed by students at any time, making it easier for them to manage their schedules and prioritize their tasks. Additionally, teachers can monitor each student's progress, provide feedback, and even create assessments that will be graded instantly, reducing the time and effort it takes to grade a traditional paper test.</p><p></p><p>Another feature of this system is its capability to track a student's compliance or completion rate. Parents and guardians can easily access their child's progress through this system, keeping them updated with their child's academic progress.</p><p></p><p>This online learning management system can also serve as a platform for teachers to collaborate and share resources, providing an avenue for professional development and growth.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I believe that the implementation of an online learning management system can provide numerous benefits to students, teachers, and parents. It will not only make learning more accessible but also provide a more personalized learning experience for each student.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for considering this proposal. I am looking forward to hearing your response.</p><p></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p></p><p>[Your Name]</p><br />

                            8. Joseph Williams was appointed CEO of Pharaoh’s Enterprises upon the death of his Jacob. The company went public under the leadership of Joseph and had to adapt to being open and transparent to outside investors. There were pressures from the shareholders to reduce costs and increase profits. In response, Joseph implemented cost- cutting measures including downsizing by means of enforcing early retirement of employees who he felt could not cope in the move to digitize the operations of the business. As expected, most of the employees were not happy and this affected the morale of their employees. Joseph sought the assistance of Nehemiah Daniels, the VP of HR. Nehemiah suggested a comprehensive program wherein it is not just the managers who would be evaluated based on achieving results but even the employees by means of demonstrating to their employees that their performance affects company results. This in turn will show to the shareholders that the company’s primary objective is to increase performance. 1. Do you agree with the proposal of Nehemiah Daniels? Explain your answer. 2. If you were an employee of Pharaoh’s Enterprises, how would you react to the new evaluation system that will measure your performance vis-à-vis predetermined outcomes or objectives. 3. Who should be involved in developing employee outcomes/objectives? 4. How do you think the problem will be addressed using proper communication?​</h2><br />

                            27. The manager of a tool and die shop needs help with job processing and control. Jobs are currently processed by hand. First, a job number is established. Next, the job supervisor estimates time and materials for the job. This is a time-consuming process, and delays are common. Then, the job is scheduled for a specific day and estimated time.
On the day, the job is to be worked on, materials orders have to be issued to stores. If materials are not available, the order has to be rescheduled.
Time cards are completed in the shop when workers fulfill the work order. These time cards are also used to chargeback time to the customer. Time cards are process by hand, and the final calculations are enter on the work order. The work orders are checked for accuracy and sent to CIS, where accounting records will be update and the customer is billed.
The problem is that the customer frequently calls to inquire on costs already incurred on a work order; but it's not possible to respond because CIS sends a report of all work orders only once a month. The management has no idea of how good initial estimates are or how much work is being done on any tool or machine, or by any worker.

                            29. MANILA - A regulator has given its final approval to the proposal to develop the Wawa Dam in Rodriguez, Rizal as a new water source for the Metro Manila, the project's proponent said on Monday. WawaJVCO, the joint venture between ports magnate Enrique Razon’s Prime Infra and businessman Oscar Violago’s San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders Group, said the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System approved the Wawa Bulk Water Supply Project during the Nov. 14 meeting of the MWSS Board. The project, which is a private arrangement between Manila Water and WawaJVCo, is expected to generate at least 80 million liters per day (mld) for Manila Water by 2021, and over 500 mld by 2025. Prime Infra said it hoped to break ground on the project next year. MWSS Chairman Reynaldo Velasco said he hoped other government agencies would soon issue permits for the project. Razon first announced the project in April as water service interruptions affected large parts of Metro Manila. The project was initially approved by the MWSS in May, but still had to hurdle a legal review by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). The MWSS said the OGCC approved the project last Nov. 7. Wawa Dam used to supply the bulk of Metro Manila's water needs before Angat Dam went into service.　what do your opinion on this matters? ​</h2><br />
