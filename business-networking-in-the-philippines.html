                                            Top 10 Most In-Demand Jobs in the Philippines’ New NormalJul 30, 2020 3:18:00 PMThe so-called “new normal” has drastically changed the business landscape. Due to physical distancing regulations and other measures implemented to fight COVID-19, some businesses have had to scale down their operations. Some even had to close down completely. Industries that primarily rely on close contact, such as travel and events, will likely recover more slowly. On the other hand, many businesses that remain up and running have adopted a full or partial work-from-home arrangement.In short, the current and post-COVID economy is and will be drastically different. In turn, this could affect the kinds of in-demand jobs today and in the future. Even now, many internet-based or internet-related jobs are experiencing an upsurge. The gig economy is also expected to continue to thrive, especially since freelancers can work with anyone, anywhere in the country (and indeed, all over the world). Thankfully, it’s now easier to work from home. Aside from flexible packages from internet providers, there are also cashless systems for in-demand jobs that make it easier to send and receive payments. These two factors are especially critical since they ensure a smoother workflow.That being said, below is a list of 10 in-demand jobs in the Philippines during this new normal. If you’re currently job-hunting and have the necessary skills, perhaps it’s time to consider putting your hat in the ring. If you’re already working these kinds of jobs, think about developing your skillset to help advance your career.Digital MarketerAs earlier mentioned, digital jobs are some of the most in-demand and stable jobs in the new normal. Such jobs include those in digital marketing, which generally refers to advertising delivered through websites, social media sites, search engines, mobile applications, and email. Indeed, traditional or offline methods of advertising (such as billboards or posters) are not as effective during a quarantine period. After all, the cost alone won’t justify the level of exposure if people are just staying at home. Thus, many companies are looking for skilled digital marketers to boost their marketing efforts.Do note that you don’t have to be an expert at every platform because they all have certain nuances that don’t apply to the others. However, it pays to at least have a basic knowledge of each platform so that you can optimize your campaigns. You should also remember that the digital landscape changes quickly, so you have to make sure that you keep up with the latest updates. At the very least, you should be updated with the latest algorithm changes of social media platforms and search engines.For those with experience in traditional marketing, you can find courses online to become a certified digital marketer. Other important skills include copywriting, design, and data analysis.Graphic DesignerGraphic designers are expected to create visual concepts to communicate ideas that inform or captivate the audience. Thus, graphic designers are also called communication designers. The job is in high demand ever since, particularly in the freelancing economy, especially because every company has a need for communication design. Digital marketing alone has a lot of need for graphic design, including social media posts, infographics, and banner ads.What’s great about being a graphic designer is that it’s relatively easy to find clients both locally and abroad. In addition, as long as you’re patient with networking, you can build a rather sizable clientele by freelancing. Of course, there are also a lot of businesses that need in-house graphic designers such as advertising agencies, PR companies, and even government agencies. Another good thing about graphic design is that there are various specializations such as package design, logo design, and content development, among many others.To be a graphic designer, you need to be proficient with design and photo-editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. You should also be knowledgeable about typography, design principles, branding, and ideation.alin po Jan ung Copied article​</a>

According to Ponemon Institute and IBM studies on cybersecurity, it costs about $7,900 per minute on average when an unplanned data center outage occurs in the United States, which is almost half a million when converted to Philippine currency. As for the annual cost of downtime to U.S. businesses, it costs about $700B (PHP 41T), which includes revenue losses and maintenance costs, among others.
Furthermore, it takes 119 minutes or almost two (2) hours on average to recover a total data center outage, which translates

                            15. Top 10 Most In-Demand Jobs in the Philippines’ New NormalJul 30, 2020 3:18:00 PMThe so-called “new normal” has drastically changed the business landscape. Due to physical distancing regulations and other measures implemented to fight COVID-19, some businesses have had to scale down their operations. Some even had to close down completely. Industries that primarily rely on close contact, such as travel and events, will likely recover more slowly. On the other hand, many businesses that remain up and running have adopted a full or partial work-from-home arrangement.In short, the current and post-COVID economy is and will be drastically different. In turn, this could affect the kinds of in-demand jobs today and in the future. Even now, many internet-based or internet-related jobs are experiencing an upsurge. The gig economy is also expected to continue to thrive, especially since freelancers can work with anyone, anywhere in the country (and indeed, all over the world). Thankfully, it’s now easier to work from home. Aside from flexible packages from internet providers, there are also cashless systems for in-demand jobs that make it easier to send and receive payments. These two factors are especially critical since they ensure a smoother workflow.That being said, below is a list of 10 in-demand jobs in the Philippines during this new normal. If you’re currently job-hunting and have the necessary skills, perhaps it’s time to consider putting your hat in the ring. If you’re already working these kinds of jobs, think about developing your skillset to help advance your career.Digital MarketerAs earlier mentioned, digital jobs are some of the most in-demand and stable jobs in the new normal. Such jobs include those in digital marketing, which generally refers to advertising delivered through websites, social media sites, search engines, mobile applications, and email. Indeed, traditional or offline methods of advertising (such as billboards or posters) are not as effective during a quarantine period. After all, the cost alone won’t justify the level of exposure if people are just staying at home. Thus, many companies are looking for skilled digital marketers to boost their marketing efforts.Do note that you don’t have to be an expert at every platform because they all have certain nuances that don’t apply to the others. However, it pays to at least have a basic knowledge of each platform so that you can optimize your campaigns. You should also remember that the digital landscape changes quickly, so you have to make sure that you keep up with the latest updates. At the very least, you should be updated with the latest algorithm changes of social media platforms and search engines.For those with experience in traditional marketing, you can find courses online to become a certified digital marketer. Other important skills include copywriting, design, and data analysis.Graphic DesignerGraphic designers are expected to create visual concepts to communicate ideas that inform or captivate the audience. Thus, graphic designers are also called communication designers. The job is in high demand ever since, particularly in the freelancing economy, especially because every company has a need for communication design. Digital marketing alone has a lot of need for graphic design, including social media posts, infographics, and banner ads.What’s great about being a graphic designer is that it’s relatively easy to find clients both locally and abroad. In addition, as long as you’re patient with networking, you can build a rather sizable clientele by freelancing. Of course, there are also a lot of businesses that need in-house graphic designers such as advertising agencies, PR companies, and even government agencies. Another good thing about graphic design is that there are various specializations such as package design, logo design, and content development, among many others.To be a graphic designer, you need to be proficient with design and photo-editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. You should also be knowledgeable about typography, design principles, branding, and ideation.alin po Jan ung Copied article​</h2><br />
