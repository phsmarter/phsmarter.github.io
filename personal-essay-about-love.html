                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. The windmill scene, in which Don Quixote mistakes the technology that grinds the grain produced in the semi-arid Manchegan landscape for giants, became immediately iconic. The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 6 And when hecomes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me,for I have found my sheep that was lost.'

Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

                                            THE CASE OF LADY SANNOXBy Arthur Doyle                The short story "The Case of Lady Sannox" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is about forbidden love, and more specifically the consequences of forbidden love. In the story the main character is Douglas Stone, a very famous surgeon who is known to be able to complete operations that no one else would even dream of doing. Though many people did not see him as an attractive person, he was carrying on a relationship...with a married woman; Lady Sannox, very sought after, and not someone you would think to be interested in the likes of Douglas Stone. One night, as Stone is getting ready to visit his lover, he gets called upon by a strange visitor. This man, a Turk, asks Stone to come with him to perform a dangerous operation on his wife's face. He claimed that his wife had fainted and had cut her lip on one of the daggers of Almohades, which according to superstition, were very poisonous. The Turk told Stone that he believed that the only way to save his wife's life was to remove the lip that had been cut by the dagger. Stone, having become very intrigued by the whole story, decided to see for himself, so he allowed the Turk to take him to see the woman. When they arrived at the home, Stone was taken into a small room where a woman was lying on a bed semi-knocked out with opium. He immediately got to work on the surgery, cutting off her bottom lip in almost no time. As soon as he had finished, she started screaming in pain and her yashmak came off, revealing her real identity. To Douglas Stone's horror, the Turk's wife was none other than his lover, the Lady of Sannox! And the Turk revealed himself to be Lord Sannox, the woman's husband.  He, the Lord Sannox, then explained to Stone how he had found out about the affair, and how he had devised the plot to get his revenge.

                            1. informative essay about Why Self-Love is Key to Personal Growth and Happiness"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>nn</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Self-love refers to the act of accepting, valuing, and caring for oneself. It is a fundamental aspect of personal growth and happiness, as it enables individuals to feel more confident and satisfied with themselves and their lives. In this essay, we will explore the importance of self-love and how it can contribute to personal growth and happiness.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, self-love is essential for personal growth. When individuals love themselves, they are more likely to take care of themselves and prioritize their needs. This can include engaging in self-care activities, setting boundaries, and pursuing their passions and interests. By doing so, individuals can develop a stronger sense of identity and purpose, which can lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and happiness.</p><p></p><p>Self-love also plays a critical role in building resilience and coping with life's challenges. When individuals love themselves, they are more likely to be kind and compassionate to themselves when they make mistakes or experience setbacks. Rather than getting stuck in negative self-talk or self-blame, individuals with self-love are more likely to see these experiences as opportunities for growth and learning. As a result, they can bounce back more quickly and effectively from difficult situations.</p><p></p><p>In addition to personal growth, self-love is also a key component of happiness. Research has consistently shown that individuals with higher levels of self-esteem and self-worth are more likely to experience greater levels of happiness and life satisfaction. This is because self-love allows individuals to feel more comfortable in their own skin, accept their flaws and imperfections, and focus on their strengths and positive qualities.</p><p></p><br />

                            2. TRODUCTION F THE HUMAN TO THE PHILOSOPHY PERSON Make a Philosophical essay about the question, "WOULD YOU RATHER LOVE AND NOT BE LOVED IN RETURN OR NOT EXPERIENCE LOVE AT ALL?" as your modest attempt to lay philosophical understanding.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Even though the emotion of love is frequently linked to pleasure and happiness, it can also result in anguish and heartbreak. It's hard to say whether one would prefer to love and not experience love at all or to love and not experience love at all. It is a moral and philosophical conundrum that has been discussed by academics and philosophers throughout history.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, loving someone and not receiving their love can be a difficult situation. It can cause feelings of unacceptance, loneliness, and hopelessness. The act of loving someone, however, can also be gratifying and unselfish. Whether or not the love is returned, it can still provide joy and happiness to the one who feels it. Lovemay awaken passion, creativity, and a sense of meaning in life. As a result, some people may decide to love even when they are aware that it won't be reciprocated because doing so is a worthwhile experience in and of itself.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On the other side, it might feel safer to not experience any love at all. It can avert the suffering and heartbreak that frequently accompany unrequited love. But living a life without love may also be isolating and unfulfilling. Love is a fundamental human urge that fosters intimacy and connection. Without it, life can seem pointless and void.</p><p></p><p>The decision to love, not be loved in return, or not experience love at all is a subjective one that is influenced by personal values and beliefs. a few personsmay place a higher value on the happiness and fulfillment that come from love, even if it is unrequited. Some may decide that avoiding the suffering and heartache associated with love is more important than ever falling in love. Each individual must ultimately determine what is best for himself.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is a difficult and challenging decision to decide whether it is preferable to love and not receive love in return or to never experience love at all. People must take into account their personal values and ideas towards love and relationships. There is no right or wrong response, but it's vital to keep in mind that love, even unrequited love, may be a priceless and significant experience that gives life joy and purpose.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            7. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent. Giving respect to others is a way of exercising and multiplying our quality of respect, which will inevitably earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, giving respect to all individuals is crucial, and it is an innate quality that we possess. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others, and it helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others. By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it.

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. The windmill scene, in which Don Quixote mistakes the technology that grinds the grain produced in the semi-arid Manchegan landscape for giants, became immediately iconic. The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic.

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

                        <p><strong>RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: "What if We Had Never Met?"</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Have you ever thought about how different your life might be if you had never met a certain person? In this narrative essay, we will explore the hypothetical scenario of a relationship never coming to be, and the potential consequences of that missed connection.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story:</p><p></p><p>It was a typical Friday night when we first crossed paths. I was out with some friends at a local bar, trying to forget about a recent breakup, when I saw him across the room. Our eyes met, and it was like everything else around us disappeared. We spent the rest of the night talking and laughing, and I knew that this was the beginning of something special.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events:</p><p></p><p>Over the next few months, our relationship blossomed. We went on adventures together, explored new places, and spent countless hours getting to know each other. We were inseparable, and I couldn't imagine my life without him.</p><p></p><p>But then, one day, everything changed. I received a job offer in another state, and I knew that I had to take it. We talked about it and decided that we would make it work, even though we would be long distance. But as the days went by, the distance between us seemed to grow. We started to drift apart, and eventually, we decided to break up.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story:</p><p></p><p>I moved away and started my new job, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. I tried to move on and focus on my career, but I couldn't help but think about what could have been. I often found myself wondering, "What if we had never met?"</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In the end, I realized that our relationship was just one of many possible paths that my life could have taken. But even though things didn't work out between us, I will always be grateful for the time we spent together. Our relationship may have been brief, but it was filled with love, laughter, and countless memories. And who knows, maybe one day our paths will cross again and we can pick up where we left off. Until then, I will always cherish the time we had together.</p><p></p><p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: The Power of Education: A What-If Scenario</p><p></p><p>Introduction: Education has always been a crucial aspect of human life. It has the power to shape our minds, broaden our horizons, and open up opportunities for us. But what if we did not have access to education? How would our lives be different? This is the question we aim to explore in this narrative essay.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story: Imagine a world where education was not considered important. Children were not encouraged to go to school, and those who did were often ridiculed for their efforts. In this world, the pursuit of knowledge was seen as a waste of time and resources.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events: As a result of this lack of emphasis on education, many people struggled to find jobs and make a decent living. They were trapped in a cycle of poverty and had little hope of breaking free. Those who did manage to secure jobs often had to settle for low-paying, unskilled positions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, without access to education, many people were unable to learn the skills needed to adapt to a rapidly changing world. As technology advanced, they were left behind, unable to compete in the job market or even keep up with the world around them.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story: Eventually, the lack of education began to take a toll on society. Crime rates increased, and people became more isolated and unhappy. The economy struggled, and the overall quality of life declined. It was clear that the absence of education had severely impacted the world in a negative way.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, education is a powerful tool that has the ability to shape our lives for the better. Without it, we would be unable to compete in a rapidly changing world and would be more likely to face poverty, isolation, and unhappiness. It is crucial that we prioritize education and provide access to it for all individuals.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Greetings, mortal.

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities.

                            27. THE CASE OF LADY SANNOXBy Arthur Doyle                The short story "The Case of Lady Sannox" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is about forbidden love, and more specifically the consequences of forbidden love. In the story the main character is Douglas Stone, a very famous surgeon who is known to be able to complete operations that no one else would even dream of doing. Though many people did not see him as an attractive person, he was carrying on a relationship...with a married woman; Lady Sannox, very sought after, and not someone you would think to be interested in the likes of Douglas Stone. One night, as Stone is getting ready to visit his lover, he gets called upon by a strange visitor. This man, a Turk, asks Stone to come with him to perform a dangerous operation on his wife's face. He claimed that his wife had fainted and had cut her lip on one of the daggers of Almohades, which according to superstition, were very poisonous. The Turk told Stone that he believed that the only way to save his wife's life was to remove the lip that had been cut by the dagger. Stone, having become very intrigued by the whole story, decided to see for himself, so he allowed the Turk to take him to see the woman. When they arrived at the home, Stone was taken into a small room where a woman was lying on a bed semi-knocked out with opium. He immediately got to work on the surgery, cutting off her bottom lip in almost no time. As soon as he had finished, she started screaming in pain and her yashmak came off, revealing her real identity. To Douglas Stone's horror, the Turk's wife was none other than his lover, the Lady of Sannox! And the Turk revealed himself to be Lord Sannox, the woman's husband.  He, the Lord Sannox, then explained to Stone how he had found out about the affair, and how he had devised the plot to get his revenge. Then he sent Stone home warning him about the consequences of messing around with someone else's wife, and the pain he had caused because of it. In three (3) paragraph form of essay, what would you do if you were in the shoe of Lord Sannox, who is the husband of Lady Sannox? Will you do the same as how he made revenged for his wife? How would you handle your emotions?​</h2><br />
                        <p>I will not because it is very cruel. I mean why would I hurt my wife just because she had an affair. I will find the cause first why she had an affair and if the cause is not reasonable then, I will suggest a divorce.</p><p></p><p>Making the man she had an affair with cut her bottom lip and faking the cause why she need a surgery is a serious crime. Everything can be talked out. Why would I even let my anger, jealousy, madness or whatever it is make me do something bad or make me hurt people.</p><p></p><p>I will first calm myself down. Talk to my wife why she had an affair. Ask her if I ever did anything wrong and if our relationship cannot get better then, I will suggest a divorce so that she can be free to do whatever she wants without me minding her or just me minding my own business as we are not in a relationship anymore and I will take a rest so I heal the wound in my heart.</p><p></p><br />
