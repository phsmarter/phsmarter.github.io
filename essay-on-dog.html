                                            Activity 6: Argument Writing: Parts of an Argumentative Essay When you write an argumentative essay, you are trying to convince your reader that your opinion is correct. A strong argumentation has six key parts. Claim A statement of opinion. This is the thesis of your argumentation. A claim requires arguments. An idea that supports the claim. An argument needs supporting evidences. Argument Evidence Proof or facts that support your each of your arguments. Counter- Argument An argument that your reader would make if they disagreed with your claim. Rebuttal Your response to the counter argument. Conclusion A convincing restatement of the original claim. Direction: Underline each part of the following argumentation using the colors listed above. Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loyal to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growl at people they think are a threat. They also help boost people's moods because they are friendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. According to them, dogs  reduce the risk of cardiovascular case and they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​pasagot po please</a>

Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loyal to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growl at people they think are a threat. They also help boost people's moods because they are friendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. According to them, dogs reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​</a>

Humans can be cruel and horrid at times but my bestfriend is just full of purity. It helps me make my life at least a little better, makes me laugh when it gets jealous at me holding other animals, annoys me when it barks at night randomly, makes me tired when it makes a mess but hey! at least I have a purpose to walk on this earth! I can't leave her/him ((use its pronouns btw)) of course! I can't make it feel sad and cry. It would be more unfair enough for it to give off positive. She/He makes me keep on going, life is harsh but not harsh enough to separate me and him/her. :))</p><br />

I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loyal to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growl at people they think are a threat. They also help boost people's moods because they are friendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. According to them, dogs  reduce the risk of cardiovascular case and they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it.

                        <p>Dogs and cats are two of the most popular household pets, but they are vastly different in many ways. While both animals bring joy and companionship to their owners, they have unique aspects that set them apart.</p><p></p><p>One of the most noticeable differences between dogs and cats is their personalities. Dogs are known for their loyalty, obedience, and eagerness to please their owners. They form strong bonds with their owners and are known to be social animals, often seeking out human interaction. On the other hand, cats are more independent and aloof, often choosing to spend time alone or in the company of just their owners. They are also less likely to obey commands, and are often described as more self-sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Another difference between dogs and cats is their physical characteristics. Dogs come in a variety of breeds, each with its own unique appearance and size. They can be trained for different activities, such as hunting, herding, or protection. Cats, on the other hand, have a more uniform appearance and are generally smaller than dogs. They are also more agile, able to climb and jump with ease, while dogs are often more suited for running and chasing.</p><p></p><p>A third difference between dogs and cats is their level of maintenance. Dogs typically require more attention and care than cats. They need to be taken for walks, played with, and groomed regularly. Dogs also need a lot of exercise to maintain their physical and mental health. On the other hand, cats are relatively low-maintenance pets, and can often be left alone for extended periods of time. They do not need to be taken for walks or groomed as often as dogs, but still require a certain level of attention and affection from their owners.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, dogs and cats are both great pets to have, but they have significant differences in terms of their personalities, physical characteristics, and level of maintenance. Ultimately, the choice between a dog and a cat depends on an individual's lifestyle, preferences, and the level of care they are willing to provide to their pet.</p><br />
