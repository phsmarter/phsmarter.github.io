                                            1. Data is an information recorded and used for the purpose of analysis. It is quantitative or qualitative information. a. Quantitative refers to numerical information obtained from measuring or counting. Examples: age, test scores, amount of money, height, weight b. Qualitative refers to descriptive attributes that cannot be subjected to mathematical operations. Examples: blood type, hair color, ethnic group, educational attainment, religion 2. Population refers to the totality of all elements or persons for which one has an interest at a time. For example, the students of Grade 8 - Euclid, the graduating class, the female students at Rosario National High School. 3. Sample is a part of a population determined by sampling procedures. There are four types: a. In a Random sample, each member of the population has an equally likely chance of being selected. The members of the sample are chosen independently of each other. Example: At a party, teams for a game are chosen by putting everyone's name into a container, and then choosing the names (without looking) random for each team. b. A Convenience sample is a sample that is chosen so that it will be easy for the researcher. Example: An interviewer conducts a survey at Robinson's Mall early in the morning on a given day.​</a>

Favorite flavor of ice cream for each grade 7 students is a categorical data. 5." What is the average number of boats that leave the pier during Monday?" is a statistical question. 6. The method that uses face-to-face inquiry to solicit information with the respondents is an interview. 7. Experimentation is also known as an indirect method of gathering data. 8. Questionnaires can be used when dealing with large group of individuals. 9. Ms. Flores wanted to learn the effectiveness of coconut oil in one's hair, she uses experimentation. 10. Mr. Johnson wanted to find out the number of deaths in different provinces of the Philippines due to the corona virus, he uses observation method.​</a>

Wrong sampling approaches may totally affect the results and outcomes of a study3. In the case study, the data could be collected primarily through in depth interviews with individuale.4. In the Ethnography, an equal number of individuals from 2 cultures could be in random5 Case study is in-depth analysis of a person, situation or event. Hence, it is difficult to operate6 Conducting a study that involves a high-performing police department who uses questionablemethods, department that does not take much risks, and a police department that has a closerelationship with the community is an example of qualitative multi-case study.7. A phenomenological viewpoint pays attention to the perceptions and feelings of people associatedwith what they experienced8. The grounded theory methodology is used to develop a theory about a phenomenon from datainductively9. In grounded theory, the data will be collected primarily through interviews10. The study that will use theory of culture is phenomenological theory.​</a>

                            8. 1. Data is an information recorded and used for the purpose of analysis. It is quantitative or qualitative information. a. Quantitative refers to numerical information obtained from measuring or counting. Examples: age, test scores, amount of money, height, weight b. Qualitative refers to descriptive attributes that cannot be subjected to mathematical operations. Examples: blood type, hair color, ethnic group, educational attainment, religion 2. Population refers to the totality of all elements or persons for which one has an interest at a time. For example, the students of Grade 8 - Euclid, the graduating class, the female students at Rosario National High School. 3. Sample is a part of a population determined by sampling procedures. There are four types: a. In a Random sample, each member of the population has an equally likely chance of being selected. The members of the sample are chosen independently of each other. Example: At a party, teams for a game are chosen by putting everyone's name into a container, and then choosing the names (without looking) random for each team. b. A Convenience sample is a sample that is chosen so that it will be easy for the researcher. Example: An interviewer conducts a survey at Robinson's Mall early in the morning on a given day.​</h2><br />

Generating themes involves identifying patterns among the codes created, and start coming up with themes. _13. In reviewing themes, researcher write up the analysis of the data. _14. Inductive coding involves coming to the data with some preconceived themes a researcher expects to find reflected there, based on theory or existing knowledge. _15.

It is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study.It can be a group of individuals, objects, events, organizations, etc. You use populations to draw conclusions.An interview is a conversation between two people--the interviewer and the interviewee --that involves asking questions to obtain information.Sampling is the process of selecting units (people, organizations) from a population of interest so that by studying the sample we may fairly generalize our results back to the population from which they were chosen.<p>[tex]_____________________________________[/tex]</p><p><strong>More </strong><strong>info </strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>whats is statistics? </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2905210?</p><p>[tex]_____________________________________[/tex]</p><br />
