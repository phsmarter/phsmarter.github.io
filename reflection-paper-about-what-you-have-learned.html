                        <p>a. It is dramatized. The <strong>Marcoses </strong>are reenacting themselves in the movies as a family who has been wronged by history. The issue with that is how the public will react considering that we have been fed the soap-opera narrative of wealthy families being treated unfairly for decades. The Marcoses identify with that family. The Marcoses are familiar with movies; their late father produced a biography to support his presidency, and the daughter, who is referred to as "darling genius of a girl" in the movie, is aware of what cinema is capable of.</p><p></p><p>b. My feeling was a bit sad about the story line and the happenings about the <strong>Marcos family</strong>.</p><p></p><p>c. It is inappropriate to evaluate <strong>"Maid in Malacanang"</strong> as a doctoral history dissertation because it is only a movie. Our difficulty is distinguishing reality from fiction, history from the director's artistic license or wild speculation. It's ridiculous that Cory Aquino was playing Mahjong with Carmelite nuns when the future of the country was on the line. As I walked out of the cinema, I felt awful for President Marcos Jr. because he had been misrepresented. Who needs enemies when you have an oldest sister like this, the President and his followers might ponder in the wake of this distorted recounting of history.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about the movie Maid in Malacanang, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/30298283</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

You can also read news articles or surf the internet to know more about the effects of media and information to the values and norms of the Philippines​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Based on the information I know, the evolution of media has played a significant role in shaping the values and norms of society. Media has the power to influence people's way of thinking, behavior, and beliefs, which ultimately affects the culture and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>In the Philippines, the influence of media has been prevalent since the introduction of television and radio in the 1950s. It has rapidly changed the way Filipinos consume information, entertainment, and news. With the rise of social media and the internet, the influence of media has become more pervasive and directly affects how Filipinos view different issues.</p><p></p><p>The values and norms of Filipinos have been shaped by media in ways we don't often realize. For instance, media has portrayed an ideal standard of beauty, which promotes westernized standards, and has led to the normalization of skin-whitening and plastic surgery. Media also reinforces gender roles and stereotypes, perpetuating the notion that women should be submissive and inferior to men.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, media has the power to influence people's political views and opinions. The recent 2016 Philippine presidential election is an excellent example of how media can sway public opinion through fake news that influences people's choices.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, media plays a significant role in shaping the values and norms of a society. It has the power to influence people's behavior, thoughts, and beliefs which ultimately reflects cultural patterns. It is essential to be critical of what we consume and the effects it has on our society. We should strive to be informed and critical thinkers to avoid being unwittingly influenced by media.</p><br />

How do you feel about the experiencec. What difficulties have you encountered? How did you solve them?​​</h2><br />
                        <p>The importance of food preservation and some common learnings, feelings, and difficulties associated with the experience.</p><p></p><p>a. Food preservation can be an important learning experience as it teaches us the value of preserving food for long-term storage and consumption. Through food preservation, we can reduce food waste and save money by extending the shelf life of perishable items. One important learning from food preservation is the different methods that can be used to preserve food, such as canning, freezing, dehydrating, and pickling, and how each method works to prevent spoilage and decay.</p><p></p><p>b. Food preservation can be a rewarding and satisfying experience as it allows us to take control of our food supply and reduce our reliance on store-bought, processed foods. By preserving our food, we can also enjoy the taste and nutritional benefits of fresh, whole foods throughout the year. However, the experience can also be challenging, especially if we are not familiar with the different preservation methods or if we encounter unexpected issues during the process.</p><p></p><p>c. Some common difficulties associated with food preservation include improper food preparation, contamination of food during the preservation process, and incorrect storage of preserved items. These difficulties can be solved by following proper food safety guidelines, using appropriate equipment and materials, and practicing good hygiene and sanitation habits. Additionally, it is important to stay informed and up-to-date on the latest food preservation techniques and safety guidelines to ensure that our preserved foods are safe, healthy, and enjoyable to eat.</p><br />

Reflection Paper - What did you learned about the E-Government &amp; E-Governance lesson- Any flashes of inspiration you have had;What you find puzzling, difficult or contradictory; andWhat new knowledge, skills or understanding have you gained during the process of writing your learning journal​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>E-government and e-governance are essential components of digital transformation in public administration. E-government refers to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to deliver government services, disseminate information, and engage citizens. E-governance, on the other hand, refers to the broader concept of using ICT to transform government structures, processes, and relationships with citizens to enhance transparency, accountability, and participation.</p><p></p><p>During the lesson, I learned that the adoption of e-government and e-governance has several benefits, including improved efficiency, transparency, and accountability. For instance, e-government can reduce administrative costs, enhance service delivery, and promote citizen engagement. E-governance, on the other hand, can enhance transparency and accountability by enabling citizens to access government information and participate in decision-making processes.</p><p></p><p>However, the implementation of e-government and e-governance also poses some challenges, such as privacy and security concerns, digital divide, and limited institutional capacity. Privacy and security concerns arise from the collection and storage of personal data, which can be misused if not adequately protected. The digital divide is a concern because not all citizens have equal access to digital technologies, which can limit their ability to participate in e-government and e-governance initiatives. Finally, limited institutional capacity can affect the success of e-government and e-governance initiatives, as it requires skilled personnel, appropriate infrastructure, and strong political will.</p><p></p><p>In summary, e-government and e-governance are crucial components of digital transformation in public administration. They have the potential to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability. However, their implementation poses several challenges that must be addressed to ensure their success.</p><br />

Recycling materials can be an important learning experience as it teaches us the value of sustainability and environmental responsibility. Through recycling, we can reduce waste and conserve resources, which can have a positive impact on the environment and future generations. One important learning from recycling is the importance of sorting and separating different materials, such as plastics, paper, and metals, to maximize their reuse and minimize their impact on the environment.</p><p></p><p>b. Recycling can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience as it allows us to take an active role in protecting the environment and promoting sustainability. By recycling, we can feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in knowing that we are doing our part to make a positive difference in the world. However, the experience can also be challenging, especially if we are not used to separating and sorting materials, or if we are not familiar with local recycling regulations and procedures.</p><p></p><p>c. Some common difficulties associated with recycling include a lack of knowledge about what materials can be recycled, confusion about local recycling regulations and procedures, and limited access to recycling facilities or programs. These difficulties can be sregularlyearch, seeking guidance from local recycling authorities, and practicing good recycling habits regularly. Additionally, it is important to stay motivated and committed to the process of recycling, even when it may seem inconvenient or challenging. By staying focused on the benefits of recycling and the positive impact it can have on the environment, we can overcome these difficulties and make recycling a regular part of our daily lives.</p><br />

                            27. make a reflection about FOOD PRESERVATION Write a Reflection paper guided by the following questions.a. What important learning have you gained from the activity?b. How do you feel about the experiencec. What difficulties have you encountered? How did you solve them?​​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Food preservation is an essential practice that enables us to enjoy fresh and safe food even beyond their natural shelf life. From the activity, I learned various techniques, both traditional and modern, for preserving food, such as canning, freezing, drying, and pickling. I also learned about the importance of hygiene and sanitation in food preservation to prevent the growth of bacteria that cause spoilage and contamination.</p><p></p><p>The experience of learning about food preservation made me appreciate the effort that goes into producing and preparing food. It made me more aware of the need to reduce food waste and make the most of the food we have. I also felt empowered to try preserving food on my own and explore new recipes and methods.</p><p></p><p>One of the difficulties I encountered during the activity was understanding the technical terms and processes involved in food preservation. However, I was able to overcome this by asking questions and doing additional research. I also had to learn to be patient, as some preservation methods take time to complete and require careful attention to detail.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the activity on food preservation was an enriching experience that provided valuable knowledge and skills that I can apply in my daily life. It made me more mindful of the food I consume and the importance of sustainable practices in ensuring food security for everyone.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> What have I learned about music is  it’s not only how much time you put in but also how focused you are and how motivated you are to improve. If you lack that focus and desire for growth, then you’re just going through the motions. You’re practicing for the sake of saying you practiced rather than practicing to improve. It’s not necessarily how much time you put in but rather how you use that time.</p><p>This is why music matters. More than you’d think. It’s not just about the black and white print and blood, sweat, and tears  it’s about making magic. It’s about self-improvement through merit.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>The  lesson on Biodiversity Climate Change was an eye-opener. It provided a clear understanding of the impact of climate change on biodiversity, and how it affects the planet's ecosystem. The lesson highlighted the importance of biodiversity and how it is essential for the survival of all living organisms.<p></p>One of the flashes of inspiration I had was the realization that climate change is not just a problem for the environment but also for human health and well-being. The lesson showed how climate change can lead to the spread of diseases, food insecurity, and even economic instability.<p></p>However, I also found some aspects of the lesson puzzling. For instance, the lesson mentioned the importance of preserving and restoring ecosystems, but it didn't provide a clear roadmap on how to achieve this. I think it would be helpful to provide more concrete examples of how individuals and communities can contribute to preserving biodiversity.<p></p>Overall, the lesson provided new knowledge and understanding of the impact of climate change on biodiversity. It also highlighted the need for collective action to address this issue. I have gained new insights on how to contribute to preserving biodiversity and the importance of taking action to mitigate climate change.<br />
