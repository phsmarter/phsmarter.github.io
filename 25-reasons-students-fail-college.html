                                            Lots of students fail classes. Some students fail because the work is too hard for them. Other times they may fail because they are lazy, and don’t do any work. Another reason why students may fail is if they don’t go to school. If you’re not in class, you may miss a lot. Many students fail classes every quarter. What text structure is in the passage? ________________________________​</a>

                                            1. Some people may argue that a college education is a waste of time anmoney. According to Vedder, “a goodly proportion of those attendingfour-year colleges full-time fail to graduate, even within six years,(Vedder, 78). By focusing on the percentage of people that fail tograduate, he overlooks the fact that 60% of college students are actuallysucceeding and graduating from college, which is more than those whoare not. People are not better off skipping college. It is important toremember that a college degree opens many doors and providesgraduates with many advantages in life.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>There can be a variety of reasons why students fail to correctly answer the given summative tests. Some students may not have understood the questions, some may not have been paying attention in class, and some may not have studied for the test. The consequences of this situation can be dire, as students may not learn the material they are supposed to, and may consequently receive a lower grade. This can also impact the student's future, as they may not be able to get into the college or university of their choice, or may not be able to get a good job.</p><br />

                            9. What are the reasons why some students fail to correctly answer the given summative tests what is the consequence of this situation</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There could be several reasons why some students fail to correctly answer summative tests. Some of these reasons are:</p><p></p><p>1. Lack of preparation: Some students do not prepare well for the test and do not have a good understanding of the topics covered in the test.</p><p></p><p>2. Poor study habits: Some students do not have effective study habits and do not use their study time efficiently.</p><p></p><p>3. Lack of motivation: Some students may not be motivated to do well on the test and may not take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>4. Anxiety and stress: Some students may feel anxious and stressed which can affect their performance on the test.</p><p></p><p>5. Difficulty in understanding the questions: Some students may have difficulty in understanding the questions and may misinterpret them, leading to incorrect answers.</p><p></p><p>The consequence of this situation is that students who fail to correctly answer summative tests may receive low grades which can affect their overall academic performance. This can also lead to a lack of confidence and motivation in the student, and may discourage them from pursuing further studies or academic goals. Moreover, it can also affect the reputation of the school and the teacher, as low test scores may be perceived as a reflection of poor teaching or lack of academic rigor.</p><p>kwkwkwkdkdkdkdkxkxkxjj</p><br />

At the elementary and secondary levels, teachers ought to identify struggling students and employ intervention strategies such as requiring students to attend review sessions or calling parents; in reality, this doesn’t always happen, so sometimes students need to seek help of their own accord. At the college level, professors rarely engage in such interventions, leaving the student to take the initiative. Extra help can be sought through a variety of means, such as visiting a school or campus math lab or tutoring center, consulting the instructor directly or hiring a professional tutor.</p><br />

No Surprises</p><p>This is probably the most important thing to keep in mind throughout the year: Make sure you keep parents apprised of any issues. If you think a student has learning problems and should be tested, don't wait until the entire year has passed before suggesting it. You can often avoid problems at the end of the year if parents have already been made aware of your concerns</p><p></p><p>2.Meet Face-to-Face with Parents</p><p>Invite them in to meet with you rather than trying to resolve a problem over the phone or email. That way, you can show them samples of their child's work or records of attendance. You can also share evidence of the times you discussed the issue with them. In the end, it's usually easier for angry parents to say unpleasant things electronically than in person.</p><p></p><p>3.Listen and Ask Questions</p><p>Shake hands with the parents who come to meet with you and ask them to explain what they're unhappy about. Wait until they finish, and don't interrupt unless you're asking for clarification.</p><p></p><p>4. Try to Find Things You Agree On</p><p>Make sure parents understand that, as the child's teacher, you'd like to see him do better, too. Be clear that your role is not to punish the child at the end of the year for not studying, not handing in work, or being absent. Your role is to figure out how to make their child more successful in the future.</p><p></p><p>5. Don't Allow Yourself to Be Pressured</p><p>A few parents may ask a teacher to change a grade or move their child forward even if he or she hasn't fulfilled the requirements. You, of course, have to adhere to your professional ethics—and you don't want the reputation of someone who can be manipulated by parents. If they want to, parents always have the option to escalate the problem to the principal.</p><p></p><p>6. Know When the Conversation Is Over</p><p>In my experience, once most difficult parents have expressed their unhappiness or anger, you can all can move on to find a workable solution together. Unfortunately, this is not the case with all parents. It's fine for parents to be angry, but it isn't OK for them to be abusive. If that happens and it's clear you're not going to agree, it's time to bring the conversation to a close. They may decide to take their complaint to the principal, and that's fine. That's how the system works.</p><p>During your career, you'll have many meetings with parents. Most of them will be easy, gratifying, and pleasant—but a handful won't be. Knowing how to deal with difficult parents should be part of every teacher's skill set, so you can keep your cool while working to find a resolution that's in the student's best interests.</p><br />

                            29. 1. Some people may argue that a college education is a waste of time anmoney. According to Vedder, “a goodly proportion of those attendingfour-year colleges full-time fail to graduate, even within six years,(Vedder, 78). By focusing on the percentage of people that fail tograduate, he overlooks the fact that 60% of college students are actuallysucceeding and graduating from college, which is more than those whoare not. People are not better off skipping college. It is important toremember that a college degree opens many doors and providesgraduates with many advantages in life.​</h2><br />
