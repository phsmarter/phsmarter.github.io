                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.

                            4. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                            16. health is wealth.there is nothing in our life that is more valuable than health. without health, there is no peace, no success and no happiness When we are ill, we do not want to work or play. Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.
