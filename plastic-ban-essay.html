Argumentative Essay: Plastic Bags vs Paper Bags Topics: Environmentalism, Recycling, Air pollution Published: May 14, 2013 (An excerpt) Our world today is experiencing an environmental dilemma particularly on the numerous solid wastes around us. This is what pushed the government to implement an ordinance that would ban plastic bags and use paper bags instead. But did the government thought of the possible environmental effects that this alternative might bring? Are they positively aware that using paper bags as a replacement for plastic bags could be of much help to mankind and our environment?The use of plastic bags had been banned for the reason that it clogs sewers and drainage canals that lead to floods and other environmental damage. But what people do not know is that it comes with a lot of benefits. First, plastic bags are cheap, reusable and can be recycled even when wet, and can hold heavy weights compared to paper bags. Second, they use less energy when it comes to their production and it generates less atmospheric pollution when produced and transported and third, it is more weather-friendly compared to paper bags and for it to be made, trees do not need to be cut. These are the main benefits of using plastic bags not only to the environment but also to mankind​</a>

Argumentative Essay: Plastic Bags vs Paper Bags Topics: Environmentalism, Recycling, Air pollution Published: May 14, 2013 (An excerpt) Our world today is experiencing an environmental dilemma particularly on the numerous solid wastes around us. This is what pushed the government to implement an ordinance that would ban plastic bags and use paper bags instead. But did the government thought of the possible environmental effects that this alternative might bring? Are they positively aware that using paper bags as a replacement for plastic bags could be of much help to mankind and our environment?The use of plastic bags had been banned for the reason that it clogs sewers and drainage canals that lead to floods and other environmental damage. But what people do not know is that it comes with a lot of benefits. First, plastic bags are cheap, reusable and can be recycled even when wet, and can hold heavy weights compared to paper bags. Second, they use less energy when it comes to their production and it generates less atmospheric pollution when produced and transported and third, it is more weather-friendly compared to paper bags and for it to be made, trees do not need to be cut. These are the main benefits of using plastic bags not only to the environment but also to mankind.​</a>

Plastic as a substance is non-biodegradable and thus plastic bags remain in the environment for hundreds of years polluting it immensely. It has become very essential to ban plastic bags before they ruin our planet completely. Many countries around the globe have either put a ban on the plastic bag or Levi tax on it. However, the problem hasn’t been solved completely because the implementation of these measures hasn’t been as successful.</p><p>[tex]\huge\tt\purple{Hope \: This \: Help}[/tex]</p><p>[tex]⊱┈──────────────────────┈⊰[/tex]</p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

                            3. write a argumentative essay of not less than 300 words about banning plastics in school​</h2><br />
                        <p>The use of plastic in schools has been a hotly debated topic in recent years. While plastic products, such as water bottles and straws, are convenient for students and teachers, the environmental impact of plastic cannot be ignored. For this reason, I believe that schools should ban the use of plastic products.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious reason for banning plastic in schools is the environmental impact. Plastic is not biodegradable, which means that it does not break down naturally in the environment. Instead, it can take hundreds of years for plastic to break down into small pieces that can be harmful to wildlife and marine life. In fact, plastic pollution is one of the leading environmental issues facing our planet today. By banning plastic in schools, we can help to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills and in our oceans.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the environmental impact, banning plastic in schools can also have a positive impact on student health. Plastic products, such as water bottles and straws, can contain harmful chemicals such as BPA, which can be harmful to human health. By banning plastic, schools can ensure that students are not exposed to these harmful chemicals.</p><p></p><p>Another argument in favor of banning plastic in schools is that it can help to reduce costs. Plastic products are often more expensive than reusable or biodegradable alternatives. By banning plastic, schools can save money on the cost of plastic products and reduce the amount of waste that needs to be disposed of.</p><p></p><p>Finally, banning plastic in schools can serve as an educational opportunity for students. By banning plastic, schools can teach students about the importance of environmental conservation and the impact of plastic pollution on our planet. This can help to create a new generation of environmentally conscious citizens.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, there are many reasons why schools should ban the use of plastic products. The environmental impact of plastic, the potential health risks, the cost savings, and the educational opportunities are all compelling reasons to make the switch to more sustainable alternatives. By taking action now, we can help to protect our planet for future generations.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Six billion plastic bags are used across the UK annually and there is no doubt that they cause environmental problems such as litter and marine pollution as well as using up oil, and limiting their use and re-using them reduces their harm.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But what are the causes of plastic pollution ? Negligence is the main cause. In fact, it is estimated that 80% of marine litter comes from land. This pollution comes mainly from household waste, which is poorly recycled, dumped in landfills or abandoned in nature.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ninety percent of the plastic items in our daily lives are used once and then chucked: grocery bags, plastic wrap, disposable cutlery, straws, coffee-cup lids.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Plastic bags are used in many everyday applications, from carrying home groceries to packing lunches, and have become an indispensable convenience for many Baybay City residents. Unfortunately, this convenience has also had some profound impacts on the environment due to plastic being non-biodegradable and clogging up drainage systems and waterways. Moreover, plastic bags often break down into dangerous microplastics that can be highly toxic to marine life and contribute to soil contamination. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, paper bags are a much better alternative from an environmental standpoint. They are made from renewable resources, unlike plastic, and can be recycled easily, so they won’t end up in landfills or oceans. Additionally, paper bags are often biodegradable, so they don’t need to be separated for special disposal, as is the case with some plastics.</p><p></p><p>Thesis statement: </p><p>Baybay City should consider banning the use of plastic bags and promote the use of paper bags instead in order to create a healthier and more sustainable environment.</p><br />

Argumentative Essay: Plastic Bags vs Paper Bags Topics: Environmentalism, Recycling, Air pollution Published: May 14, 2013 (An excerpt) Our world today is experiencing an environmental dilemma particularly on the numerous solid wastes around us. This is what pushed the government to implement an ordinance that would ban plastic bags and use paper bags instead. But did the government thought of the possible environmental effects that this alternative might bring? Are they positively aware that using paper bags as a replacement for plastic bags could be of much help to mankind and our environment?The use of plastic bags had been banned for the reason that it clogs sewers and drainage canals that lead to floods and other environmental damage. But what people do not know is that it comes with a lot of benefits. First, plastic bags are cheap, reusable and can be recycled even when wet, and can hold heavy weights compared to paper bags. Second, they use less energy when it comes to their production and it generates less atmospheric pollution when produced and transported and third, it is more weather-friendly compared to paper bags and for it to be made, trees do not need to be cut. These are the main benefits of using plastic bags not only to the environment but also to mankind.​</h2><br />

However, plastic bags have a number of negative impacts on the environment and wildlife. When plastic bags are not disposed of properly, they can end up in the ocean, where they can harm marine life and contribute to the problem of plastic pollution. In addition, plastic bags can take hundreds of years to break down, meaning that they can remain in the environment for a very long time.</p><p>Paper bags, on the other hand, are a more sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to plastic bags. They are made from a renewable resource, and they can be easily recycled. In addition, paper bags have a much lower impact on the environment compared to plastic bags, as they break down more quickly and do not contribute to plastic pollution.</p><p>A ban on plastic bags and promotion of paper bags in Baybay City would have a positive impact on the local ecosystem. It would reduce the amount of plastic pollution in the area, and it would encourage residents to adopt more sustainable practices. Additionally, such a ban would send a message to the community that Baybay City is committed to protecting the environment and promoting sustainability.</p><p><strong>Position paper:</strong></p><p>The issue of plastic bags and their negative impact on the environment has gained increasing attention in recent years. While plastic bags are convenient and widely used, they have numerous negative consequences, including harm to wildlife and the environment, and contribute significantly to the problem of plastic pollution. In contrast, paper bags are a more sustainable and eco-friendly alternative, and their use can have a positive impact on the local ecosystem.</p><p>For these reasons, it is necessary to ban the use of plastic bags and promote the use of paper bags in Baybay City. Such a ban would reduce the amount of plastic pollution in the area, and it would encourage residents to adopt more sustainable practices. In addition, a ban on plastic bags and promotion of paper bags would send a message to the community that Baybay City is committed to protecting the environment and promoting sustainability.</p><p>There are some who argue that plastic bags are necessary and that a ban on them would be inconvenient or burdensome. However, the negative impacts of plastic bags far outweigh any potential inconvenience. There are many alternatives to plastic bags, such as paper bags, reusable cloth bags, and even using one's own personal containers, which can be easily carried and used in place of plastic bags.</p><p>In conclusion, a ban on plastic bags and promotion of paper bags in Baybay City is necessary in order to protect the environment and wildlife, and to promote sustainability in the community. The negative impacts of plastic bags far outweigh any potential inconvenience, and there are many alternatives that can be used in their place. By taking this important step, Baybay City can demonstrate its commitment to protecting the environment and promoting sustainability for future generations.</p><br />
