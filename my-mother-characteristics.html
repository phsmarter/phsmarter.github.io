The clouds were thick, vel Youth went out And opened her breast and took her heart. To see huis Maiden lair. He did not shed a tear! "Dear One," he pleaded as he knell Before her feet, in tears, "My love is true; why have you kept Me waiting all these years?" Then back to his Maiden fair he ran, Unmindful of the rain; But his feet slipped and he fell down And loud he groaned with pain! The maiden looked at him unmoved, It seemed, and whispered low: Persistent Youth, you have to prove By deeds your love is true," Still in his hand he held the prize That would win his Maiden's hand; And he thought of his mother dear So kind, so sweet, so fond. "There's not a thing I would not do For you, Beloved," said he. "Then go," said she, "10 vour mother dear And bring her heart to me." And then he heard a voice, Not from his lips but all apart: "Get up," it said; "Were you hurt, Child?" It was his mother's heart, 1.

                                            true/false 
1. The beliefs and ways of analyzing literature of Femininity criticism can be based on how gender role and gender stereotype are reflected in every story.
2. The Courage That My Mother Had ascribe to femininity because the title itself gives an idea that its subject is a woman and the descriptions talk about a woman and her outstanding characteristics.
3. The poem For the 4th Grade, Prospect School: How I Became a Poet is both a feminine and masculine poem.
4. In the poem The Second Coming, the word "Anarchy" was mentioned. Anarchy is a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.
5. The poem Prophecy of the Sand has both feminine and masculine views.
6. The most important idea of the poem The Courage That my Mother Had is the reverence and admiration that the child has for a mother whose extreme courage will never be forgotten.
7. The most important idea of the poem For the 4th Grade, Prospect School: How I Became a Poet is about losing toys and materials things only.
8. In the poem The Second Coming, the first image presented is that of the falconer.
9. The line "Equality is the greatest story a woman ever told" speaks of a woman's desire to be treated as a man's equal.
10. A gyre is a spiral that expands outward as it goes up. The image of a gyre is frequently used to describe the motion of history toward chaos and instability.</a>

                                             There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. She and I had dispensed from joining the group; saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner- something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were-she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that 174 manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent." A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing- room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.

                                            The Sun and the Moon (Bagobo Tradition) Long ago the Sun had to leave the Moon to go to another town. He knew that his wife, the Moon, was expecting the birth of a child; and, before going away, he said to her, "When your baby is born, if it is a boy, keep it; if a girl, kill it." A long time passed before the Sun could come back to the Moon, and while he was gone, the Moon gave birth to her baby. It was a girl. A beautiful child it was, with curly hair like binubbud, with burnished nails that looked like gold, and having the white spots called pamoti on its body. The mother felt very sad to think of killing it, and so she hid it in the big box (kaban) where they kept their clothes. As soon as the Sun returned, he asked the Moon, "How about our baby?" At once the Moon replied, "It was a girl: I killed it yesterday." The Sun had only a week to stay at home with the Moon. One night he dreamed that a boy with white hair came to him from heaven. The boy stood close to him, and spoke these words:- "Your wife got a baby, but it was a girl; and she hid it away from you in the box." When the Sun wakened from sleep, he was very angry at the Moon, and the two fell to quarrelling about the baby. The Moon wanted the child saved. "You ought to keep it with you," she urged. "No, no!" protested the Sun. "I cannot keep it, because my body is so hot it would make your baby sick." "And I cannot keep it," complained the Moon, "for my body is very dark; and that would surely make the child sick." Then the Sun fell into a passion of rage; and he seized his big kampilan, and slew the child. He cut its small body into numberless little bits, as many as the grains of sand that lie along the seashore. Out of the window he tossed the pieces of the shining little body; and, as the gleaming fragments sparkled to their places in the sky, the stars came to birth. 1.

The clouds were thick, vel Youth went out And opened her breast and took her heart. To see huis Maiden lair. He did not shed a tear! "Dear One," he pleaded as he knell Before her feet, in tears, "My love is true; why have you kept Me waiting all these years?" Then back to his Maiden fair he ran, Unmindful of the rain; But his feet slipped and he fell down And loud he groaned with pain! The maiden looked at him unmoved, It seemed, and whispered low: Persistent Youth, you have to prove By deeds your love is true," Still in his hand he held the prize That would win his Maiden's hand; And he thought of his mother dear So kind, so sweet, so fond. "There's not a thing I would not do For you, Beloved," said he. "Then go," said she, "10 vour mother dear And bring her heart to me." And then he heard a voice, Not from his lips but all apart: "Get up," it said; "Were you hurt, Child?" It was his mother's heart, 1.

                            24. true/false 
1. The beliefs and ways of analyzing literature of Femininity criticism can be based on how gender role and gender stereotype are reflected in every story.

                            25.  There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. She and I had dispensed from joining the group; saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner- something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were-she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that 174 manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent." A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing- room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement. Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.

                            29. The Sun and the Moon (Bagobo Tradition) Long ago the Sun had to leave the Moon to go to another town. He knew that his wife, the Moon, was expecting the birth of a child; and, before going away, he said to her, "When your baby is born, if it is a boy, keep it; if a girl, kill it." A long time passed before the Sun could come back to the Moon, and while he was gone, the Moon gave birth to her baby. It was a girl. A beautiful child it was, with curly hair like binubbud, with burnished nails that looked like gold, and having the white spots called pamoti on its body. The mother felt very sad to think of killing it, and so she hid it in the big box (kaban) where they kept their clothes. As soon as the Sun returned, he asked the Moon, "How about our baby?" At once the Moon replied, "It was a girl: I killed it yesterday." The Sun had only a week to stay at home with the Moon. One night he dreamed that a boy with white hair came to him from heaven. The boy stood close to him, and spoke these words:- "Your wife got a baby, but it was a girl; and she hid it away from you in the box." When the Sun wakened from sleep, he was very angry at the Moon, and the two fell to quarrelling about the baby. The Moon wanted the child saved. "You ought to keep it with you," she urged. "No, no!" protested the Sun. "I cannot keep it, because my body is so hot it would make your baby sick." "And I cannot keep it," complained the Moon, "for my body is very dark; and that would surely make the child sick." Then the Sun fell into a passion of rage; and he seized his big kampilan, and slew the child. He cut its small body into numberless little bits, as many as the grains of sand that lie along the seashore. Out of the window he tossed the pieces of the shining little body; and, as the gleaming fragments sparkled to their places in the sky, the stars came to birth. 1.
