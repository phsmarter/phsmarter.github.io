                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just leaning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our socie:ty is the fact that it helps people learn how to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to learn" things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children's lives by not vaccinating them, and walk smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. ​</a>

Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

Fausto I strongly believed that due to COVID- 19 Pandemic more people nowadays prefer to use bicycles to get from one place to another and it became the safest ride vehicle. Grade 6-English First, bicycles are environment friendly because it does not release smoke that can create air pollution. Second, it reduces the use of fuel specifically gasoline is because it is not powered by any fuel instead it is powered by the riders muscles in order for it to move. Third, it allows people to save money in their fare or fuel especially nowadays that the fare for commuters increases. Fourth, it is a safe vehicle from home to your workplace or other places you may want to go and vice versa, because you don't need to be exposed in many commuters along the way and you can breathe freely, and feel the breeze while riding on the bicycle. Fifth, you can use it for recreational activities especially when you want to explore places you haven't been before. Sixth, it can improve your muscle strength and cardio-vascular condition. Finally, it can be a good exercise specifically when you want to lose weight. To some people, they might argue that bicycles are not the safest ride and are unserviceable specifically in carrying packages and other loads, but when you think of a good idea, like putting a basket, adding racks or panniers to the bicycle you can be amaze about the capability to carry the loads.

It is not about the knowledge they accumulate; it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life.

Persuasive point 3 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are.

They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism, then most of the people in the US would have autism.

Special interest and big tobacco profited off the loss of lives, leading to many to take legal action against tobacco manufacturers. On the heels of the historic Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), we are now facing a new smoking trend: e-cigarettes. Right now, California’s Proposition 56, a ballot measure to tax e-cigarettes, is up for a vote, and the same special interest that supported big tobacco has set their sights killing the measure. If passed, the measure tax e-cigarettes just like other tobacco products.The special interests and big tobacco have argued that e-cigarettes aren 't like regular cigarettes. Our research disputes that notion. In fact, the toxins acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are emitted through the electronic nicotine delivery systemthe component that delivers flavored vapor and nicotine to the user. Although it’s still unclear as to how much nicotine the user is getting, studies have shown that the effect on the lungs is the same.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Smoking should be banned.</p><p>There are medications out there that are harming everyone. The chemical I'm going to discuss is nicotine, which is contained in cigarettes. Although some good people believe that smoking cigarettes will have no direct impact on their lives, they are mistaken; smoking is nothing more than a death sentence.</p><p>Smoking is not a joke; despite what we see on TV, in comic books, and maybe right in front of our eyes, it has a negative impact on our health. Have you ever looked at the bottom of the cigarette box closely? If you didn't see, it says: SMOKING MAY CAUSE LUNG CANCER, HEART DISEASE, AND MAY ALSO COMPLICATE PREGNANCY. Doesn't it surprise you that cigarette firms are warning us?</p><p>Lung cancer, lip, mouth, and tongue cancer, as well as heart attacks, are all caused by smoking. Smoking can devastate all of your goals and dreams. Have you ever seen a cigarette commercial? You have to agree, the people in that commercial appear to be having a good time. Have you ever noticed how they never show you an "after picture"? The reason for this is that such people are now unsightly as a result of too many puffs on their bodies. "Every puff is like a taste of death," observed General George Washington. Even if you only take a small puff, you can become really unwell. As a result, you should never begin smoking.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Why is Education Important in Our Society:<p>One of the benefits of education is that the educational system teaches us how to obtain and develop critical and logical thinking and make independent decisions. When children become adults, they are faced with a lot of challenging issues – pay off your student loans, get a job, buy a car and a house, provide for your family, etc. However, if one has spent years educating themselves, they should be able to make sound decisions on these various quandaries. Not only are people able to form their own opinions, but they are also good at finding solid and reliable arguments and evidence to back up and confirm their decisions. !!</p><br />
