                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As fake news became rampant, journal articles plays a significant role. Specifically, it serves as a reliable source on a certain topic. According to Social Weather Stations (SWS) Seven out of 10 adult Filipinos believe the problem of fake news and its spread on the internet is serious. This encompasses 32 percent of respondents who believe fake news in media like television, radio, and newspaper was “very serious,” 38 percent said it was “somewhat serious,” 6 percent said it was “somewhat not serious” and 3 percent think it was “not serious at all.” Meanwhile, 21 percent were undecided. People should use reliable sources to avoid misinformation and be vigilant about any articles they read. The survey made only was an indication that many Filipinos don't make time to research or gather reliable information on a certain topic. This is very alarming because the knowledge of our future generations is at risk. This can be resolved if reliable sources like journal articles would be encouraged to use as a main source of information especially on the current issues globally.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>GLOBAL PANDEMIC</p><p></p><p>        School closures due to COVID-19 have brought significant disruptions to education. Emerging evidence from some of the region’s highest-income countries indicate that the pandemic is giving rise to learning losses and increases in inequality. </p><p>       The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound impact, not only on people’s health, but also on how they learn, work and live. The COVID-19 pandemic has created the largest disruption of education systems in human history, affecting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 200 countries. Closures of schools, institutions and other learning spaces have impacted more than 94% of the world's student population. The pandemic and school closures not only jeopardized children’s health and safety with domestic violence and child labor increasing, but also impacted student learning substantially. </p><p>         The online learning, distance and continuing education have become a panacea for this unprecedented global pandemic, despite the challenges posed to both educators and the learners. Transitioning from traditional face-to-face learning to online learning can be an entirely different experience for the learners and the educators, which they must adapt to with little or no other alternatives available. The education system and the educators have adopted “Education in Emergency” through various online platforms and are compelled to adopt a system that they are not prepared for. </p><p>         The lesson learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic is that teachers and students/learners should be oriented on use of different online educational tools. After the COVID-19 pandemic when the normal classes resume, teachers and learners should be encouraged to continue using such online tools to enhance teaching and learning.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>C@RRY ON LE@RNING</p><p>H0PE !T H3LPS</p><p>F0LL0W FOR MORE ANSW3R</p><p>PA-BR@!NL!3$T</p><br />
