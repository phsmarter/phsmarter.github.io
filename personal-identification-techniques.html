                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>1. PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTA psychological evaluation is when one meets with a psychologist who asks various questions. The psychologist may also give tests (such as those filled out on paper) that can see if there are any specific problems such as mood problems.The psychological assessment is carried out by a specialized clinical psychologist. The first step in the evaluation is to determine a clinical problem that will guide the choice of evaluation methods and the questionnaires and psychometric tests used.It includes not only battery of tests but interview sessions as well and observations to have a clear perspective view of every aspect.<p></p>2.  PSYCHOTHERAPYThe goal is to promote significant changes in the client's cognitive, emotional or behavioral functioning, in his interpersonal system, in his personality or in his state of health.It aims to bring about changes in attitudes, behaviors, ways of thinking or reacting in a person, in order to allow them to feel better, to find answers to their questions, to solve problems, to make choices , to understand each other better.<p></p><p></p>3. COUPLE'S THERAPYThe session with a marriage counselor generally takes place as a couple, but it is quite possible to consult him alone. It is also possible to combine sessions for couples and individual sessions. A session lasts on average 1 hour and can be unique or followed by other sessions.Couple therapy can help develop an ecological relationship by stopping believing that what is good for oneself is necessarily good for the other, but it is also bringing everyone to become aware of their own responsibility in what they feel. , in the desires he has, the choices he makes.<p></p>4. FAMILY THERAPYFamily therapy is usually brief, 5 to 6 sessions are enough. But it can be longer or shorter depending on the situation. The course of the therapy also depends on the practices of each therapist (psychoanalytical, systemic, behavioral and cognitive).It can also be a Group Therapy.<p></p>Family therapy considers the psychological and behavioral disorders of a member of a group as a symptom of the dysfunction of the group - generally the family (parents, siblings, etc.). Its goal is to bring a different reading of the problem and to give back to the family their functioning abilities.<p></p><p></p>5. COUNSELLINGThe assistance-advice service designates the service offered in terms of management that makes it possible to provide the necessary assistance and advice.Consultation with a psychologist is necessary when the person's troubles prevent him from having a satisfactory social life. This concerns both professional and personal relationships. It is not necessary to have a medical prescription to consult.<p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8900936</p><br />
