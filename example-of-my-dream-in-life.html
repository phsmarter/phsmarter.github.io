Our today's occasion is an outstanding event for all of us as another academic year has come to an end. This means that another group of students graduate from our school and is to start its way into the 'adult life'. 1) ______, this 'adult life' seems to be less appealing and more terrifying with its close oncoming. 2) ____, there are a few important things I am eager to tell our graduates. 3) _____is: do not be afraid of the changes that come to your life; they are crucial, unpredictable, and overwhelming but you are able to deal with them. 4) ______, just built your own way and remember that your families and friends are always there to provide you with any needed support. 5). ______, please, keep in mind the fact that we are graduating after you and look up for you as the examples and inspirations, so, do not be up to anything you would not like us to do. I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness. Thank you and congratulations!​</a>

                                            Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.
What other images are created in your mind as you read "Air Castles"?

                                            Activity 1.2 Take It Literary! A. In his famous speech, “I Have a Dream”, Martin Luther King Jr. used variety of literary and rhetorical devices. Here are some of the examples: Anaphora is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of a series of clauses or sentences. It’s often seen in poetry and speeches, intended to provoke an emotional response in its audience. Examples: 1. O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed. My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? 2. My life is my purpose. My life is my goal. My life is my inspiration.” Parallelism is the use of components in a sentence that are grammatically the same; or similar in their construction, sound, meaning or meter. Examples: 1. Like father, like son 2. Flying is fast, comfortable and safe Metaphor is a figure of speech which makes an implicit, implied or hidden comparison between two things that are unrelated but share some common characteristics. Examples: 1. My brother was boiling mad. 2. The assignment was a breeze.​</a>

                            19. Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.
What other images are created in your mind as you read "Air Castles"?

He is also a PhD in Communication and Media and a Master of Arts and Media and Cultural Studies, University of Western Sydney.</p><p></p><p>“Air Castle” is a poem that wrote by Mr. Juan F. Salazar. An inspiring poem that everyone can reflect on their own selves. A poem that really hard to understand on the first sight but it connects to reality of life. A great poem that one can led as a inspiration. One thing that we would appreciate and love.</p><p></p><p>The Poem want to make people realize that ambition is not easy to achieve you can always experience rejection; rejection is not always be the reason to quit it must be always the inspiration to continue and trying again your ambition in life until you achieve it.</p><p></p><p>The poem itself has been regarded by some to speak to man’s relationship with God. With lines such as: “Enthroned was he, like unto a God/ the depth he reached is dark to me”… In the last stanza of the poem, the speaker points out the reality behind the saying “try and try until you succeed”. A person should not give up on something because if he/she does, he/she will never achieve what he/she wants…</p><p></p><p>There is a question I hear and it somehow connects to the poem:”Do you think it is really important to aim for something?” For me, when you aim something you can earn a respect from others but the important thing when you achieve that you can learn not easily giving up on something…Air Castle is all about your ambitions in life, the things or you want to be you want to have in the future. Having ambition in life is not committing a mistake in life; it can be a mistake when you plan aim it in a wrong way… Ambition must always use by motivating you to make things successful… Ambition is always your guide in to fulfill what you want to be or to have… The poem gives a motivation to me to pursue my ambition without hesitation and negative thoughts in my mind that can let me think that I can’t achieve it… not only in having an ambition and achieving it but also loving what you are doing, because loving what you are doing is one of the key to achieve your ambition and making it in reality.</p><br />

                            22. Activity 1.2 Take It Literary! A. In his famous speech, “I Have a Dream”, Martin Luther King Jr. used variety of literary and rhetorical devices. Here are some of the examples: Anaphora is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of a series of clauses or sentences. It’s often seen in poetry and speeches, intended to provoke an emotional response in its audience. Examples: 1. O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed. My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? 2. My life is my purpose. My life is my goal. My life is my inspiration.” Parallelism is the use of components in a sentence that are grammatically the same; or similar in their construction, sound, meaning or meter. Examples: 1. Like father, like son 2. Flying is fast, comfortable and safe Metaphor is a figure of speech which makes an implicit, implied or hidden comparison between two things that are unrelated but share some common characteristics. Examples: 1. My brother was boiling mad. 2. The assignment was a breeze.​</h2><br />
