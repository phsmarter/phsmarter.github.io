                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1As the coronavirus pandemic rapidly sweeps across the world, it is inducing a considerable degree of fear, worry and concern in the population at large and among certain groups in particular, such as older adults, care providers and people with underlying health conditions.</p><p></p><p>In public mental health terms, the main psychological impact to date is elevated rates of stress or anxiety. But as new measures and impacts are introduced – especially quarantine and its effects on many people’s usual activities, routines or livelihoods – levels of loneliness, depression, harmful alcohol and drug use, and self-harm or suicidal behaviour are also expected to rise.Sedentary behaviour and low levels of physical activity can have negative effects on the health, well-being and quality of life of individuals. Self-quarantine can also cause additional stress and challenge the mental health of citizens.</p><p></p><p>Physical activity and relaxation techniques can be valuable tools to help you remain calm and continue to protect your health during this time. WHO recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, or a combination of both.Contact tracing can break the chains of transmission through the rapid identification, isolation and clinical care of cases, and providing supported quarantine of      contacts, meaning that virus transmission can be stopped.</p><p></p><p>2.The major stakeholders in the healthcare system are patients, physicians, employers, insurance companies, pharmaceutical firms and government. Insurance companies sell health coverage plans directly to patients or indirectly through employer or governmental intermediaries</p><br />

                        Covid-19. ㅡ Meanwhile, COVID-19 can cause neurological and mental side effects such as delirium, agitation, and stroke.Nutrition. ㅡ The goal of community nutrition actions is to improve the quality of life and contribute to the health promotion of the population in the community where programs and services are provided.The Philippine government has aggressively confronted the HIV/AIDS problem with an action plan that includes an emphasis on local government agency response, involvement and support of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), incorporation of HIV/AIDS education into school curricula, and laws.It all depends on who is developing and educating those children. It could simply be indoctrination. You should also consider who gets to decide what global threats and concerns are. It is preferable to teach people without a specific goal, to teach them to educate themselves, and to let them choose the path they want to take. A large number of educated people pursuing their own goals is preferable to a few leading a large number of people towards agendas.#Carryonlearning <p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>1.) How does the Philippine government address different local and national health issues and concerns like HIV/AIDS cases and tobacco and alcohol related diseases?</strong></p><p>The Philippine government addresses different health issues and concerns through various programs and initiatives. For instance, the Department of Health (DOH) has implemented the Philippine Health Agenda, which aims to improve the delivery of health services and to address the country’s health challenges, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and non-communicable diseases. The government has also passed laws and regulations, such as the Sin Tax Law, which imposes higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol products to deter their consumption and reduce related diseases.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.) Who do you think are the stakeholders or partners of the government in addressing health problems?

The artworks and styles of the past have evolved and have adapted to a dynamic changing world, a world immersed in the latest technology and emerging ideologies to become the Contemporary Art of today. 2 Contemporary Art refers to art of any form and genre that produced in our contemporary time, simply put as "art created today." 3. Genres are categories of artistic creation and are characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. 4. Contemporary Art is expressions of the artist's thoughts and feelings based on their experience of the here and now which current events, issues and social concerns affecting the society where the artist lives in. 5. Contemporary Philippine artists hail from the different regions of the country and they use a wide variety of art media in their creations. These are materials that are readily available in the locality where the artist resides. 6 Contemporary Arts have different elements that are put together to come up with a distinct artwork like Performance, Appropriation, Technology, Hybridity and Space. (Mnemonics: PATHS) 7. The distinct features of Contemporary Philippine Art include Communal, Holistic, Intuitive, Multi-focal, Integrative and Creative Process. (Mnemonics: CHIMIC) 8 Contemporary Philippine Art considers not only the artist but also the participation of the community through the viewers wherein the experience is not solely confined to the creator of the art but also to the viewer of the art. 9. Integrative Art comes in different sizes and shapes, forms and styles as observed in Junk Art which is a sculptural rendition using discarded or used materials. 10.

Insurance companies sell health coverage plans directly to patients or indirectly through employer or governmental intermediaries. Education broadens the horizon of any individual.
