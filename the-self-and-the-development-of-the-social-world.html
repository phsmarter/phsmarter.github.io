                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Physical Growth or Growth</p><p>2. Puberty</p><p>3. Adolescence </p><p>4. Pituitary Gland</p><p>5. Gonads</p><p>6. Adolescent growth spurt</p><p>7. Cognitive development</p><p>8. Identity development</p><p>9. Moral and spiritual</p><p>10. The sudden and rapid physical </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Physical growth usually refers to changes in size or mass; so it is correct to say that a child grows in stature (height) or body weight. Even though most people usually think of growth at the level of the whole child, the cells and internal structures that make up the child also grow, primarily by increasing in number or size. Consequently, auxologists (those who study child growth) may be interested in the growth of bones to help understand fractures and osteoporosis; the growth of the heart walls to help understand hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart disease; or the growth of adipose tissue (body fat) to help understand obesity.</p><p></p><p>2.Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. </p><p></p><p>3. During adolescence (usually considered age 10 to the late teens or early 20s), boys and girls reach adult height and weight and undergo sexual maturation (puberty). The timing and speed with which these changes occur vary and are affected by both heredity and environment.</p><p></p><p>4.The pituitary gland is referred to as the “master gland” because it monitors and regulates many bodily functions through the hormones that it produces, including: growth and sexual/reproductive development and function.</p><p></p><p>5.The primary reproductive organs, or gonads, consist of the ovaries and testes. These organs are responsible for producing the egg and sperm cells gametes), and hormones.</p><p></p><p>6.Physical changes of puberty mark the onset of adolescence (Lerner &amp; Steinberg, 2009). For both boys and girls, these changes include a growth spurt in height, growth of pubic and underarm hair, and skin changes (e.g., pimples). Boys also experience growth in facial hair and a deepening of their voice. Girls experience breast development and begin menstruating. These pubertal changes are driven by hormones, particularly an increase in testosterone for boys and estrogen for girls. The physical changes that occur during adolescence are greater than those of any other time of life, with the exception of infancy. In some ways, however, the changes in adolescence are more dramatic than those that occur in infancy—unlike infants, adolescents are aware of the changes that are taking place and of what the changes mean. In this section, you will learn about the pubertal changes in body size, proportions, and sexual maturity, the social and emotional attitudes and reactions toward puberty, and some of the health concerns during adolescence, including eating disorders</p><p></p><p>7. In adolescence, changes in the brain interact with experience, knowledge, and social demands and produce rapid cognitive growth. The changes in how adolescents think, reason, and understand can be even more dramatic than their obvious physical changes. This stage of cognitive development, termed by Piaget as the formal operational stage, marks a movement from the ability to think and reason logically only about concrete, visible events to an ability to also think logically about abstract concepts.</p><p></p><p>8. Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to ‘trying on’ different behaviors and appearances to discover who they are. In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are likely to cycle through several identities to find one that suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one’s thoughts about the self.</p><p></p><p>9. Young adolescents are interested in the bigger meanings of life. They want to know where they belong and where they can make a difference. Parents and teachers may notice that young adolescents experience and/or express:</p><p>• An idealistic sense of social justice and fairness</p><p>• A need to have choices and make personal decisions</p><p>• A desire to make a difference in the world and the lives of others</p><p>•an interest in learning about other cultures and beliefs</p><p>• A need to ask challenging questions about life and relationships</p><p></p><p>10. The sudden and rapid physical changes that adolescents go through make adolescents very self-conscious. They are sensitive and worried about their body changes. They may make painful comparisons about themselves with their peers. Physical changes may not occur in a smooth, regular schedule.</p><br />
