Wha Ecology Club Finds Gold in Garbage Good morning! This is the Great Discovery Integrated School News Center. For our news "Ecology Club Members Find Gold in Garbage" A group of students from the Ecology Club of Great Discovery Integrated School in Cavite ventured on a project to protect the environment through waste segregation. This was the result of their overnight stay at the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL) in Silang, Cavite. The Ecology Club members aimed to reduce the solid waste generated by students and maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school. Shane Frias, the club president said, "Through our club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation," she further explained. They began the project after talking to the students during the general assembly. The students were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. There were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, non-biodegradable, plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P 8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When asked about what they would do with their money, they said, “We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the Student Coordinating Organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speak, probably she would say, “Keep up the good work, kids." Here ends our news for today. This is Vincent, reporting from GDIS News Center. Good day and God bless!​</a>

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

Wha Ecology Club Finds Gold in Garbage Good morning! This is the Great Discovery Integrated School News Center. For our news "Ecology Club Members Find Gold in Garbage" A group of students from the Ecology Club of Great Discovery Integrated School in Cavite ventured on a project to protect the environment through waste segregation. This was the result of their overnight stay at the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL) in Silang, Cavite. The Ecology Club members aimed to reduce the solid waste generated by students and maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school. Shane Frias, the club president said, "Through our club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation," she further explained. They began the project after talking to the students during the general assembly. The students were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. There were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, non-biodegradable, plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P 8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When asked about what they would do with their money, they said, “We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the Student Coordinating Organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speak, probably she would say, “Keep up the good work, kids." Here ends our news for today. This is Vincent, reporting from GDIS News Center.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

As a teacher, you should be aware on the diversities of thelearners or the types of learners that you have in your dass. There are students who prefer visual learning. Theylike seeing and observing things, including pictures, diagrams, written directions and more. Some tend to leambetter when the subject matter is reinforced by sound which is called the auditory learners, Kinesthetic learnerssometimes called tactile learners, learn through experiencing or doing things. The last one is the easiest to cater tosince much of the traditional educational system tends to center on writing essays, doing research and readingbooks. These types of learners are called reading/writing learners.Signature of parent/guardian:​</h2><br />
