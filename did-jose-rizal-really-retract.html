                        <p>Rizal's Retraction. A mjaor controversy about him, did he retract or not? Rizal fought the Spaniards through his writings. There is this priest that once said Rizal retracted because of Josephine (I don't remember the surname), because Rizal wanted to marry her but there is a comdition, he will retract. The priest (I don't also remember his name) said that he was the priest-in-charge for their marriage. However, there were no marriage certificate shown, therefore, it was a lie. And one more thing, if Rizal retracted, all of his hardworks to tell us about the cruelty of Spaniards to the Filipinos would all go to waste. He is loyal to his fellow Filipinos.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>He didn’t want to retract his two books, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo because he wanted to expose the abuses of the Spaniards to the Filipino people. This was one of the reasons Spaniards wanted him to retract these two books. These two books opened the eyes of the Filipino people which led to revolution. Rizal proved that “pen is mightier than a sword”. For his expertise in writings enable him to convince his whole fellowmen to attain justice, thus destroying an empire.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There is one issue in Jose Rizal’s life that historians have debated on several occasions but remains unsettled. That issue is whether Rizal, on the eve of his death, re-embraced the Catholic faith and disassociated himself from Masonry. The matter is controversial because parties on both sides are affiliated with an organization that promotes moral values and the pursuit of truth. The pro-retraction camp is represented by the Jesuits, the archbishop of Manila, and a few other members of the Catholic hierarchy. Since they are all ordained priests, they are assumed to be truthful in their pronouncements. Their opponents are the members of Masonry, an organization that promotes brotherhood, integrity, decency, and professionalism.</p><p>      This paper resurrects the retraction controversy in the light of the emergence of another primary source that speaks about what happened to Rizal on the eve of his death. This document was never considered in the history of the retraction controversy because it was made available to researchers only in the past decade. The author of the report is a credible eyewitness because he was physically present in the vicinity of where Rizal was detained. His narrative is lucid and contains details that cast doubt on the credibility and reliability of earlier primary sources on which previous narratives were based. This document needs serious consideration and should be included in the discourse on Rizal’s retraction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>There is one issue in Jose Rizal’s life that historians have debated on several occasions but remains unsettled.

                            15. WHAT I HAVE LEARNED? AND WHAT IS YOUR STAND ON RIZAL'S RETRACTION? DID HE REALLY
RETRACTED?</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>I have learned that Jose Rizal, the Philippine national hero, wrote a letter before his execution in 1896 stating that he has fully retracted all his works that had gone against the Catholic Church and the Spanish rule in the Philippines. In this letter, Rizal reaffirmed his faith in God and the Catholic Church, and renounced any beliefs that ran counter to their teachings.</p><p></p><p>My stand on Rizal's retraction is that it was genuine, as evidence from modern documents shows. The original letter has now been lost, but it is speculated that in his final moments, Rizal made the personal decision to retract his works out of respect for the Church and the Spanish government. My understanding of the situation is that Rizal agreed to recant in order to spare his family and those who shared his beliefs the repercussions of his actions. This, according to the Philippine Supreme Court, was a noble gesture that embodied Rizal’s selflessness and loyalty to his nation. Therefore, I believe that Rizal did indeed retract his previous works.</p><br />

                        Yes, The flow of history is as inexorable as the tidal flow of an angry ocean. But ever so often in our collective recollection, it is remembered that sometimes the skilful use of forgery can redirect the flow of history itself. <br /><br />      In the Philippines today, forgery is usually resorted to redirect the flow of money from the rightful beneficiary to the unworthy pockets of invisible people. <br /><br />      That money is usually the target of forgery is known and practiced all over the world, but forgery in the hands of the wily, has power to effect a redirection of events and undoing of history. It has the power to obscure or beliee an occurrence or create an event that did not actually transpire.  It also has the power to enslave and destroy. <br /><br />      In October 1600, the Muslim Ottoman Army and a Christian army,  led by Austrians, with Hungarian, French, Maltese and German troops were battling it out for territory called Kanizsa. The Ottoman army was outgunned and outmanned, but the Ottoman commander, Tiryaki Hasan Pasha was a clever man. He knew that the Hungarians were not too happy to be allied with the Austrians. So he sent fake letters, designed them to be captured by the Austrians. The letters contained Hungarian alliance with Ottoman forces. The Austrian upon reading the fake letters signed by a reliable source (obviously forged) decided to kill all Hungarian soldiers.<br />
