                                            The Discontented Pendulum
FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) Archie forgot to do his homework over the weeekend as he was busy on his mobile phone and totally forget about it.</p><p>2) When Archie arrived at their room, he saw his classmates copy from other's notebooks about their homework.</p><p>3) Archie chose to not copy other's work because he knew it is a bad thing to do because copying other's homework is cheating.</p><p>4) Archie's teacher was not angry, hence the teacher smiled at Archie and commended him for being honest enough to admit his mistakes. His teacher told him he could do it over the lunch break and he does not need to worry.</p><p>5) It is important to be honest and always be truthful because as they said, honesty is the best policy. Honesty is a foundation of trust, if we will not be honest people around us will not give their trust to us anymore. Aside from that, an act of cheating does not only mean that you are only cheating on others but you are also deceiving yourself.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hope it helps!</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            6. The Discontented Pendulum
FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.
