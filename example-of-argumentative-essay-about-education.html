Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</a>

                                            Let's ApplyRead an example of an argumentative essay below. Then answer the activity thatfollow by completing the outline with necessary information on a separate sheet ofpaper.Every school day, more than seven thousand students become dropouts. Annually. that adds up to about 1.3 million students who will not graduate from high school with their peers as scheduled. Students should never drop out of high school because they will be far more likely to spend their lives periodically unemployed, on government assistance, or cycling in and out of the prison system.One reason that someone should not drop out of high school is that they are far more likely to struggle keeping a good job. Most places would prefer to hire a worker that as completed high school. This is important because even a person is capable of doing the job, the employer might overlook them simply because they are a quitter. Even if the dropout gets a job, others that are more educated are more likely to be promoted faster because they are more qualified. Therefore, a person that has dropped out will be forced to work at places that do not require much skill and thus, make less money. More specifically, high school dropouts earn 143 dollars less per13week than a worker with their diploma. This totals to nearly a 7,500 dollars difference each year, and that is if the dropout can keep their job. All in all, it is quite clear that nothing good will come from students dropping out of high school. Struggling to keep a job, relying on government assistance, and being in and out of prison are very realistic possibilities for the students who do not graduate. Do not be part of the 7,000-refuse to quit. When school gets tough, seek the help needed in order to graduate on time and help make the future brighter.1.IntroductionA. Hook: B. Thesis Statement:2.

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons. First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore. Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced. Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing.​</a>

Read the argumentative essay and complete the argument chart.Topic:Claim:Arguments:a.b.C.d.Counterarguments:a100Note: An argument shows support for the author's claim (for example: reasons, evidence, data and statistics) while a counterargument explains the opposite point of view.   individualism is a fundamental part of a society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: School Uniforms</p><p></p><p>Claim: School uniforms are a better choice for public schools.</p><p></p><p>Arguments:</p><p></p><p>a. Wearing school uniforms would simplify students' lives and eliminate the stress of deciding what to wear every day.</p><p></p><p>b. School uniforms help students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals, as they create a feeling of unity and give the message that school is a special place for learning.

School uniforms would make all students feel equal, regardless of their financial status. It would promote pride and raise self-esteem among students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing.</p><p></p><p>Counterarguments:</p><p></p><p>a. Some may argue that school uniforms limit students' self-expression and creativity. However, students can still express themselves through accessories or other means outside of clothing. Moreover, uniforms promote a sense of unity and belonging, which may be more important in a school environment.</p><p></p><p>b. Others may argue that implementing school uniforms can be costly for families who cannot afford them. However, many schools have programs to help families obtain uniforms at a low cost or for free. Additionally, over time, uniforms can save money for families who would otherwise have to purchase expensive clothing for school.</p><p></p><p>c. Some may argue that school uniforms do not address the root causes of student behavior problems and that other solutions should be explored. While school uniforms are not a panacea, they have been shown to have positive effects on behavior and academic performance, as well as promote a sense of community and pride among students.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            12. Let's ApplyRead an example of an argumentative essay below. Then answer the activity thatfollow by completing the outline with necessary information on a separate sheet ofpaper.Every school day, more than seven thousand students become dropouts. Annually. that adds up to about 1.3 million students who will not graduate from high school with their peers as scheduled. Students should never drop out of high school because they will be far more likely to spend their lives periodically unemployed, on government assistance, or cycling in and out of the prison system.One reason that someone should not drop out of high school is that they are far more likely to struggle keeping a good job. Most places would prefer to hire a worker that as completed high school. This is important because even a person is capable of doing the job, the employer might overlook them simply because they are a quitter. Even if the dropout gets a job, others that are more educated are more likely to be promoted faster because they are more qualified. Therefore, a person that has dropped out will be forced to work at places that do not require much skill and thus, make less money. More specifically, high school dropouts earn 143 dollars less per13week than a worker with their diploma. This totals to nearly a 7,500 dollars difference each year, and that is if the dropout can keep their job. All in all, it is quite clear that nothing good will come from students dropping out of high school. Struggling to keep a job, relying on government assistance, and being in and out of prison are very realistic possibilities for the students who do not graduate. Do not be part of the 7,000-refuse to quit. When school gets tough, seek the help needed in order to graduate on time and help make the future brighter.1.IntroductionA. Hook: B. Thesis Statement:2.

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons. First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore. Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced. Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status.

Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Since 1990s STEM is a term used to refer education policies to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. But is much more, because it has implications for workforce development, teaching frameworks, industries, no formal education, etc. Is a term which also involves the equity of a country and some challenges like the gender gap.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Art education is crucial for the children's development. Many school boards feel that art education is not a necessity and not very important in the lives of today's students. Art classes are constantly compared to the main core classes, such as math and English. Many people feel that core classes are much more valuable to a child's education, which is why art may be cut first from schools if there is low funding. Art classes offer children critical lessons about life that they are not exposed to in any of the other classes. Art teachers drive the creativity and the imagination of students, while allowing students to express themselves.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
