"God allows us to feel a significant amount of discontentand dissatisfcation in life longings that will never be fulfilled on this side of eternity.

                                            Original text:
“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a human we need to set or to know our limitations or boundaries for example of our limitations is when we're eating, our limitation in eating is when we're full, we need to stop eating because it's bad for our health when overfeed. The second example of our limitation is when we're using our gadgets we need to set our time when using this because over using of gadgets are not good for our healths and also for our studies. So in summary by setting our limitations we can be free and understand everything, we also have a knowledge of  the proper usage of it. Always remember that we have freedom to do so but I believe that by being free we also need to apply our limitations and boundaries because it is our way  to be happy and to full fill our goals in life.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>: yes, I agree because in the Allegory of the Cave, Plato distinguishes between people who mistake sensory knowledge for the truth and people who really do see the truth.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:For me i agree with plato's claim because Plato believed that humans could be broken down into 3 parts: the body, the mind and the soul. The body is the physical part of the body that is only concerned with the material world, and through which we are able to experience the world we live in. it wants to experience self-gratification. It is mortal, and when it dies, it is truly dead. The mind is directed towards the heavenly realm of Ideas, and is immortal. It is with our minds that we are able to understand  the eternal world of the Forms. When it 'dies' it returns to the realm of Ideas. The soul is the driving force of the body, that it is what gives us our identity.The body and the inclinations are mortal but transmigrate into animals, but the intellect is immortal. He believes that the intellect represents the most divine part of the soul, and so after death it leaves the inferior physical body to join the world of Ideas.Plato believed that phenomena are fragile and weak forms of reality. They do not represent an object’s true essence. The senses are not trustworthy. Plato believed that there was a higher realm of existence accessible only through using your intellect to go beyond your senses.Plato argues that the soul is a universal, pure, one substance, unchanging, immortal. The body is a compound substance, ever changing, and mortal. The body interfere’s with the soul’s ability to sense reality. Furthermore, this means that the soul must survive death and exist prior to birth, like any other universal. Our difficulty is being able to get beyond our sense so that we can realize this prior to the death of our bodies. The true philosopher should never fear death because the soul is freed from the handicap of the body and joins other invisible, pure, beings untainted by the body, able to bask in pure reality.</strong></p><br />

“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</h2><br />

In comparison to a personal essay, a formal essay is more meticulously planned and serious. Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman who lived between the mid-1950s and the early 1600s, is credited with creating the formal essay. His works cover topics like death, fear, truth, and riches and are condensed, impartial, and informed. The writing style of a personal essay is informal and conversational. The informality of the personal essay is one of its main qualities. Its primary goal is to pique interest, with informational value coming second.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay:</p><p></p><p>1. Three Generations of Human Rights</p><p></p><p>Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that every individual is entitled to, simply because they are human beings. These rights have been categorized into three generations based on the time period and the focus of the rights.</p><p></p><p>First Generation: Civil and Political Rights</p><p>The first generation of human rights includes civil and political rights, which were first recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person, freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and association, as well as the right to a fair trial and freedom from torture, slavery, and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>Second Generation: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</p><p>The second generation of human rights emerged in the mid-20th century and focused on economic, social, and cultural rights. These rights include the right to education, work, social security, healthcare, and a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of the individual and their family.</p><p></p><p>Third Generation: Collective Rights</p><p>The third generation of human rights arose in the latter half of the 20th century and focuses on collective rights. These include the right to peace, a clean and healthy environment, and the right to self-determination of peoples and their cultures.</p><p></p><p>2. Sources of Human Rights Law in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Constitution and laws are the primary sources of human rights law in the Philippines. The 1987 Constitution specifically enumerates the civil and political rights, as well as economic, social, and cultural rights of all Filipino citizens. The Bill of Rights, in particular, outlines the fundamental rights of individuals and imposes limitations on the power of the state to ensure the protection of these rights.</p><p></p><p>International law is also a source of human rights law in the Philippines. The Philippines has ratified several international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. These treaties have become part of Philippine law and are recognized as sources of human rights law.</p><p></p><p>3. Personal Opinion on Human Rights Issues in our Country</p><p></p><p>As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions. However, I can provide a general statement on human rights issues in the Philippines. Despite the existence of laws and treaties protecting human rights, violations of these rights still occur in the Philippines. Human rights abuses such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture continue to be reported. There is a need for the government to uphold its commitment to protecting and promoting human rights and for individuals to be aware of their rights and actively advocate for them.</p><br />
