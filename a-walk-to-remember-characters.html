Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

She could see only the legs of the cameramen, hunched over the cameras, with their empty glass camera eyes staring back at her like space aliens. As she walked across the stage to the oak podium, the carpet muffed the sound of her footsteps, and the spotlight blinded her for a moment. Beyond the false windows, there was only a blue panel, meant to suggest the sky, and she remembered her own days as an undergraduate. Her shoes hurt, and she wished she had chosen another pair this morning. But of course, she could not say that. She put that to the back of her mind. “Welcome to Writing Creative Nonfiction,” she said. “I’m Tilar Mazzeo, and together we’ll be exploring what it means to write a great story.” •Do a close reading of your chosen text and analyze it based from the following aspects: a.

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

From which point of view is the story written?Tell Me a Story About Your ShoesOne Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for homeless wo downtown Boston I was given this gift of a story in response to the opening prompt, Tell me abo your shoes."I pass this story along now in honor of the woman who shared tYou see these beautiful white sneakers? I didn't always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of walking the show and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There's a shoes story there that often has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair in my size left I put them on and couldn't believe how good they felt: I walk all around the store in them, thinking how rice it would be if they were mine knew I didn't have money to get them that day but I also knew that if I waited they'd be gone, I brought them up to the front of the store and asked the guy behind the counter of he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I promised hem I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he couldn't. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I couldFor the next two weeks, I scraped by until had enough money to go back for my shoes Funny how I kept calling them mine, as if somehow I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look Sure enough they were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aide that had my site, but there were no shoes left like them. They were gone.I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day, I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me. I started to walk faster to get away, but he an after me still yelling "I have your shoes. me a few times of hearing it to get what be meant I HAVE YOUR SHOES "OK", I said. "Tve got the money now to pay for them." "No. No, he said "They've been pad for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours"I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran after me, still yelling. "I have your shoes." It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. 1 HAVE YOUR SHOES. "OK", I said. "I've got the money now to pay for them." "No. No", he said "They've been paid for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours"1 can't tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day.As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn't that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that i was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, "Thank you".need the answer now :) thank you...​</a>

Tell Me a Story About Your Shoes   One Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for homeless wo downtown Boston I was given this gift of a story in response to the opening prompt, Tell me abo your shoes."I pass this story along now in honor of the woman who shared t You see these beautiful white sneakers? I didn't always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of walking the show and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There's a shoes story there that often has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair in my size left I put them on and couldn't believe how good they felt: I walk all around the store in them, thinking how rice it would be if they were mine knew I didn't have money to get them that day but I also knew that if I waited they'd be gone, I brought them up to the front of the store and asked the guy behind the counter of he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I promised hem I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he couldn't. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I could For the next two weeks, I scraped by until had enough money to go back for my shoes Funny how I kept calling them mine, as if somehow I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look Sure enough they were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aide that had my site, but there were no shoes left like them. They were gone. I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day, I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me. I started to walk faster to get away, but he an after me still yelling "I have your shoes. me a few times of hearing it to get what be meant I HAVE YOUR SHOES "OK", I said. "Tve got the money now to pay for them." "No. No, he said "They've been pad for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours" I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran after me, still yelling. "I have your shoes." It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. 1 HAVE YOUR SHOES. "OK", I said. "I've got the money now to pay for them." "No. No", he said "They've been paid for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours" 1 can't tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day. As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn't that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that i was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, "Thank you". need the answer now :) thank you...​</a>

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

I didn't always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of walking the show and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There's a shoes story there that often has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair in my size left I put them on and couldn't believe how good they felt: I walk all around the store in them, thinking how rice it would be if they were mine knew I didn't have money to get them that day but I also knew that if I waited they'd be gone, I brought them up to the front of the store and asked the guy behind the counter of he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I promised hem I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he couldn't. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I couldFor the next two weeks, I scraped by until had enough money to go back for my shoes Funny how I kept calling them mine, as if somehow I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look Sure enough they were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aide that had my site, but there were no shoes left like them. They were gone.I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day, I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me. I started to walk faster to get away, but he an after me still yelling "I have your shoes. me a few times of hearing it to get what be meant I HAVE YOUR SHOES "OK", I said. "Tve got the money now to pay for them." "No. No, he said "They've been pad for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours"I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran after me, still yelling. "I have your shoes." It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. 1 HAVE YOUR SHOES. "OK", I said. "I've got the money now to pay for them." "No. No", he said "They've been paid for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours"1 can't tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day.As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn't that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that i was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, "Thank you".need the answer now :) thank you...​</h2><br />

I want to go over it together as aclass so you have enough time to study through the week," Mrs. Beckett explained."Do your best. This study guide looks a lot like the test."Math was difficult for Liam, so he was nervous about the test on ThursdayWith the right answers on his study guide, Liam went to his room every night thatweek and studied. He looked at the problems over and over. It didn't seem to behelping, though. Liam was still very nervous and he felt unprepared. What would theproblems look like on the real test? How would they be different than the studyguide?On Thursday, Liam took his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest girl in thegrade. He glanced over at her paper at the very beginning. Then, it became a habit.aAfter each question he finished, he looked at the girl's paper. He wanted to make surehe got them right. When his answer did not match the girl's, he changed his answer.He decided that she probably had the correct answer since she was so smart. Thepaper came back with a 100.

Jacob's Test Jacob's Math teacher announced that their test would be given on Thursday. As he walked around the class, he handed out a study guide. You will complete this study guide at home tonight. It is due tomorrow. I want to go over it together as a class, so you have enough time to study through the week. Do your best. This study guide looks alot like the test," Mrs. Reyes explained. Math was difficult for Jacob, so he was nervous about the test on Thursday. With the nght answers on his study guide, Jacob went to his room every night that week and studied. He looked at the problems over and over. It didn't seem to be helping, though. Jacob was still very nervous, and he felt unprepared. What would the problems look like on the real test? How would they be different than the study guide? On Thursday, Jacobtook his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest boy in the grade. He glanced over at his paper at the very beginning. Then, it became a habit. After each question he finished, he looked at the boy's paper. He wanted to make sure he got them nght. When his answer did not match the boy's, he changed his answer. He decided that he probably had the correct answer since he was so smart. The paper came back with a 100. However, Jacob's guilt felt heavy in his chest. He didn't earn that grade, so he couldn't be proud of himself for that.

Tell Me a Story About Your Shoes   One Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for homeless wo downtown Boston I was given this gift of a story in response to the opening prompt, Tell me abo your shoes."I pass this story along now in honor of the woman who shared t You see these beautiful white sneakers? I didn't always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of walking the show and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There's a shoes story there that often has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair in my size left I put them on and couldn't believe how good they felt: I walk all around the store in them, thinking how rice it would be if they were mine knew I didn't have money to get them that day but I also knew that if I waited they'd be gone, I brought them up to the front of the store and asked the guy behind the counter of he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I promised hem I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he couldn't. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I could For the next two weeks, I scraped by until had enough money to go back for my shoes Funny how I kept calling them mine, as if somehow I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look Sure enough they were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aide that had my site, but there were no shoes left like them. They were gone. I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day, I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me. I started to walk faster to get away, but he an after me still yelling "I have your shoes. me a few times of hearing it to get what be meant I HAVE YOUR SHOES "OK", I said. "Tve got the money now to pay for them." "No. No, he said "They've been pad for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours" I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran after me, still yelling. "I have your shoes." It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. 1 HAVE YOUR SHOES. "OK", I said. "I've got the money now to pay for them." "No. No", he said "They've been paid for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours" 1 can't tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day. As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn't that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that i was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, "Thank you". need the answer now :) thank you...​</h2><br />
