                                            PASAGOT BRAINLEST KO MAKA TAMA!Barbara couldn’t take it anymore. Her upstairs neighbor was blasting his stereo again. She had asked him twice already to turn the volume down. The first time she asked, he was surprised. He said he didn’t know that she could hear his stereo. “Yes,” she said, “it’s just like your stereo was in my living room. I can hear every note!” He said he would keep it down. She hoped that he was telling the truth. Of course, he wasn’t. The very next day, he blasted his stereo. She marched upstairs to remind him of his promise. He said the volume was so low that he could barely hear it. She asked him to turn it lower. He said he would try. Barbara could swear that when she reentered her apartment, the music was louder than when she had walked upstairs. So, this was at the third time. She took her baseball bat upstairs with her. She knocked very loudly on his door. When we opened the door, she creamed at him like a crazy person. She told him she would kill him if he didn’t turn the music down and keep it down. His eyes got big. She went downstairs. She couldn’t hear a note. I can’t believe I said that, she told herself. Comprehension Check 1. What is the setting of the story (time and place)? 2. What would you do if your neighbor had loud music on and would not turn the volume down? 3. What is the lesson (moral) of the story? 4. Who are the characters in the story? 5. How did Barbara’s neighbor feel the first time she asked him to turn the music down?​</a>

                                            Barbara couldn’t take it anymore. Her upstairs neighbor was blasting his stereo again. She had asked him twice already to turn the volume down. The first time she asked, he was surprised. He said he didn’t know that she could hear his stereo. “Yes,” she said, “it’s just like your stereo was in my living room. I can hear every note!” He said he would keep it down. She hoped that he was telling the truth. Of course, he wasn’t. The very next day, he blasted his stereo. She marched upstairs to remind him of his promise. He said the volume was so low that he could barely hear it. She asked him to turn it lower. He said he would try. Barbara could swear that when she reentered her apartment, the music was louder than when she had walked upstairs. So, this was at the third time. She took her baseball bat upstairs with her. She knocked very loudly on his door. When we opened the door, she creamed at him like a crazy person. She told him she would kill him if he didn’t turn the music down and keep it down. His eyes got big. She went downstairs. She couldn’t hear a note. I can’t believe I said that, she told herself. Comprehension Check 1. What is the setting of the story (time and place)? 2. What would you do if your neighbor had loud music on and would not turn the volume down? 3. What is the lesson (moral) of the story? 4. Who are the characters in the story? 5. How did Barbara’s neighbor feel the first time she asked him to turn the music down?​</a>

                                            summarize it if we come across with a very long text. Here are you can summarize a text. Text A Mario stood calmly by the door of the principal's office while waiting for his teacher. He looked farther to check on his adviser if she would be coming because she was nowhere. After a few minutes, a spectacle man was in sight it was the school principal. Mario told the principal about the purpose of his visit. He made his statement clear why he brought his cell phone to school. He told the principal that his classmates shouted at him to their classroom, telling him that bringing cellphone was not allowed. He felt weak explaining his reason for doing it. He told the principal that it hurt him to have violated a school policy but doing this made him feel secure to text or call up his sick mother at home. He told the principal that he was sorry for doing it, but it hurt him because his purpose was concern of his sick mother. The principal patted the apologetic pupil on the shoulder and spoke kindly to him. Text B While waiting for his adviser to come, Mario visited the principal's office. His purpose was to explain why he had brought his cell phone in class. Earlier, his classmates noisily reminded him that bringing cell phone in school was not allowed. Nevertheless, Mario told the principal that it hurt him to violate the school policy but he had to do it. Mario said that he felt secure to text or call his sick mother. The principal just patted the apologetic pupil and spoke to him kindly. How is Test A different from Text B? Text B is the summary of Text A, which is the original text? How are the two texts the same? Do they have the same idea and details? Likewise, you may also use a summary chart to organize your ideas like in Story Grammar STORY GRAMMAR Setting Characters Plot A When and where did the story happen? 8 Who are the persons Moving in the story?answer po. ​</a>

                                            Please answer asap thank you!!        One day a boy asked his daddy, “Dad what are you going to give me on my birthday?” The father replied, “Son, there is much time left.” A few days before his birthday, the boy fainted and was rushed to the hospital. He was diagnosed of a kidney problem and his parents found out that he was probably going to die. When he was lying on the hospital bed he said, “Daddy, have they told you I am going to die?” The father replied, “No, you will live!” As he left, the weeping child then asked, “How can you be so sure?” He turned around and said, “I know.” The son eventually celebrated his birthday and continued to live. Obviously, the father prayed for his child to continue to live. Prayer strengthens and makes us certain in all things. All we need is to fully trust and believe that God will listen to us and grant our needs like in the story of Abraham. He trusted God’s word, and God rewarded his faith. Describe the father-son relationship as shown in the following dialogues:a. “Dad, what are you going to give me on my birthday?”_________________________________________________________________________________b. “Daddy have they told you I am going to die?”_________________________________________________________________________________c. “How can you be so sure?”_________________________________________________________________________________If you were the son, how would you take your father’s answer?__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>How would you like your life story to be told?</strong><strong></strong><p><strong>Life story</strong> or also called as <strong>anecdote</strong> is a short, brief, and interesting story of someone's life or experience. Personally, I would like my life story to be told as:</p><strong>As simple as it can be</strong> - I want a simple depiction of my life events because I really don't like extravagant descriptions. As I have lived my life as simply as I can, I hope someone has noticed this simplicity and tell others how simple I am.<strong>A man with firm decisions</strong> -  I really follow my philosophies in life and as much as I want to, live in peace and harmony with others. I hope that my family would see me as a man of integrity, a man whom can be trusted, and a man worthy of their respect. I may be limited with many things but I think I can do things others can't. I would like them to see that I am the father they can rely on. Unlike those fathers who left them behind, who quit providing for them just because they can't stand other's giving orders to them. I am not competing with others, I just want them to see that I am doing everything for them.<strong>A man who loves God</strong> - above all other things, I really value my faith in God because it gives me hope especially in times of troubles. I have experienced great, marvelous things that I don't even thought would happen to me and that is because I placed my trust and faith to Jesus. I really want to set an example to them and eventually do the same. I don't force them to have the same faith but I do the best that I can so that they themselves would decide to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.<p></p><p>This is my dispositions about my life story, and it yours may be way different from this.

                            24. summarize it if we come across with a very long text. Here are you can summarize a text. Text A Mario stood calmly by the door of the principal's office while waiting for his teacher. He looked farther to check on his adviser if she would be coming because she was nowhere. After a few minutes, a spectacle man was in sight it was the school principal. Mario told the principal about the purpose of his visit. He made his statement clear why he brought his cell phone to school. He told the principal that his classmates shouted at him to their classroom, telling him that bringing cellphone was not allowed. He felt weak explaining his reason for doing it. He told the principal that it hurt him to have violated a school policy but doing this made him feel secure to text or call up his sick mother at home. He told the principal that he was sorry for doing it, but it hurt him because his purpose was concern of his sick mother. The principal patted the apologetic pupil on the shoulder and spoke kindly to him. Text B While waiting for his adviser to come, Mario visited the principal's office. His purpose was to explain why he had brought his cell phone in class. Earlier, his classmates noisily reminded him that bringing cell phone in school was not allowed. Nevertheless, Mario told the principal that it hurt him to violate the school policy but he had to do it. Mario said that he felt secure to text or call his sick mother. The principal just patted the apologetic pupil and spoke to him kindly. How is Test A different from Text B? Text B is the summary of Text A, which is the original text? How are the two texts the same? Do they have the same idea and details? Likewise, you may also use a summary chart to organize your ideas like in Story Grammar STORY GRAMMAR Setting Characters Plot A When and where did the story happen? 8 Who are the persons Moving in the story?answer po. ​</h2><br />

                            26. Please answer asap thank you!!        One day a boy asked his daddy, “Dad what are you going to give me on my birthday?” The father replied, “Son, there is much time left.” A few days before his birthday, the boy fainted and was rushed to the hospital. He was diagnosed of a kidney problem and his parents found out that he was probably going to die. When he was lying on the hospital bed he said, “Daddy, have they told you I am going to die?” The father replied, “No, you will live!” As he left, the weeping child then asked, “How can you be so sure?” He turned around and said, “I know.” The son eventually celebrated his birthday and continued to live. Obviously, the father prayed for his child to continue to live. Prayer strengthens and makes us certain in all things. All we need is to fully trust and believe that God will listen to us and grant our needs like in the story of Abraham. He trusted God’s word, and God rewarded his faith.
