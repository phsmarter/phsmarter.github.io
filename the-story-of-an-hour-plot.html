Write your answer in the boxes.THE STORY OF AN HOURBy Kate ChoppinLouise Mallard has a heart trouble, so she must be informed carefully about her husband’s death. Her sister, Josephine, tells her the news. Louise’s husband’s friend, Richards, learned about a railroad disaster when he was in the newspaper office and saw Louise’s husband. Brently, on the list of those killed. Louise begins sobbing when Josephine tells her of Brently’s death and goes upstairs to be alone in her room.Louise sits down and looks out an open window. She sees trees, smells approaching rain, and hears a peddler yelling out what he’s selling. She hears someone singing as well as the sounds of sparrows, and there are fluffy white clouds in the sky. She is young, with lines around her eyes. Still crying, she gazes into the distance. She feels apprehensive and tries to suppress the building emotions within her, but can’t. She begins repeating the word Free! To herself over and over again. Her hearts beats quickly, and she feels very warm.Louise knows she’ll cry again when she sees Brently’s corpse. His hands were tender and he always looked at her lovingly. But then she imagines the years ahead, which belong only to her now, and spreads her arm out joyfully with anticipation. She will be free, on her own without anyone to oppress her. She thinks that all women and men oppress one another even if they do it out of kindness. Louise knows that she often felt love for Brently but tells herself that none of that matters anymore. She feels ecstatic when her newfound sense of independence.Josephine comes to her door, begging Louise to come out, warning her that she’ll get sick if she doesn’t. Louise tells her to go away. She fantasizes about all the days and years ahead and hopes that she lives a long life. Then she opens the door, and she and Josephine start walking down the stairs, where Richard is waiting.The front door unexpectedly opens, and Brently comes in. He had not been in the train accident or even aware that one had happened. Josephine screams, and Richards tries unsuccessfully to block Louise from seeing him. Doctors arrive and pronounce that Louise died of heart attack brought on by happiness.1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE PLOT2.

Write your answer in the boxes.THE STORY OF AN HOURBy Kate ChoppinLouise Mallard has a heart trouble, so she must be informed carefully about her husband’s death. Her sister, Josephine, tells her the news. Louise’s husband’s friend, Richards, learned about a railroad disaster when he was in the newspaper office and saw Louise’s husband. Brently, on the list of those killed. Louise begins sobbing when Josephine tells her of Brently’s death and goes upstairs to be alone in her room.Louise sits down and looks out an open window. She sees trees, smells approaching rain, and hears a peddler yelling out what he’s selling. She hears someone singing as well as the sounds of sparrows, and there are fluffy white clouds in the sky. She is young, with lines around her eyes. Still crying, she gazes into the distance. She feels apprehensive and tries to suppress the building emotions within her, but can’t. She begins repeating the word Free! To herself over and over again. Her hearts beats quickly, and she feels very warm.Louise knows she’ll cry again when she sees Brently’s corpse. His hands were tender and he always looked at her lovingly. But then she imagines the years ahead, which belong only to her now, and spreads her arm out joyfully with anticipation. She will be free, on her own without anyone to oppress her. She thinks that all women and men oppress one another even if they do it out of kindness. Louise knows that she often felt love for Brently but tells herself that none of that matters anymore. She feels ecstatic when her newfound sense of independence.Josephine comes to her door, begging Louise to come out, warning her that she’ll get sick if she doesn’t. Louise tells her to go away. She fantasizes about all the days and years ahead and hopes that she lives a long life. Then she opens the door, and she and Josephine start walking down the stairs, where Richard is waiting.The front door unexpectedly opens, and Brently comes in. He had not been in the train accident or even aware that one had happened. Josephine screams, and Richards tries unsuccessfully to block Louise from seeing him. Doctors arrive and pronounce that Louise died of heart attack brought on by happiness.1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF THE PLOT2.

The plot of the story revolves around Louise's emotional journey, which leads her to realize her newfound sense of independence.</p><p></p><p>2. THREE MAJOR EVENTS THAT ADD SUSPENSE OR TENSION TO THE PLOT THAT LEAD TO THE CLIMAX:</p><p>a) Louise's initial reaction to the news of her husband's death, where she begins sobbing and goes upstairs to be alone in her room, creates suspense and tension in the plot.</p><p></p><p>b) Louise's realization of her newfound sense of freedom, as she gazes out the window and repeats the word "free" to herself, adds to the suspense and tension of the plot.</p><p></p><p>c) Brently's unexpected return at the end of the story, after Louise has already started to embrace her newfound independence, adds a twist to the plot and leads to the climax.</p><p></p><p>3.THE MOST SUSPENSEFUL PART OF THE PLOT:</p><p>The most suspenseful part of the plot is when Louise realizes her newfound sense of freedom and begins repeating the word "free" to herself. The buildup of emotions within her, her racing heart, and warm feelings add to the tension and suspense in the story.</p><p></p><p>4.TWO EVENTS THAT UNRAVEL THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE PROTAGONIST AND ANTAGONIST THAT LEAD TO THE RESOLUTION:</p><p>a) Louise's realization that she has been oppressed in her marriage and her newfound sense of independence help to resolve the conflict between herself and her husband.</p><p></p><p>b) Brently's unexpected return and Louise's subsequent death help to resolve the conflict in a tragic way.</p><p></p><p>5.EVENT IN THE STORY THAT THE CONFLICT IS RESOLVED:</p><p>The conflict is resolved when Louise realizes her newfound sense of independence and begins to embrace it. However, the resolution is short-lived, as Brently's unexpected return leads to her death. The story ends on a tragic note, with the conflict unresolved in a more traditional sense</p><br />
