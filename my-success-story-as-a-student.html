In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

                                            Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</h2><br />

                            21. Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.
