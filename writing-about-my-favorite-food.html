Life in a New PlaceI am from Abulug, Cagayan, but now living in Tuguegarao City to study. There are many adjustments that I mustmake. First of all, I must get used to do all the household chores since I am living in a small apartment all by myself.Especially, I need to learn how to prepare my own food even if fast food chains are just around the corner. Myfavorite though is Jollibee; its fried chicken with gravy is the best. The busyness of the place requires another kind ofadjustment. In my hometown, there aren't any malls yet, the number of people is small, and activities are limited.Abulug is a coastal municipality in the province of Cagayan. Lastly, my school then is small; but now I need to adaptto a big institution with big buildings and new facilities. I am adjusting to Tuguegarao City in some ways, but it is nota problem for me because I love this place as much as I love my hometown.2. Summer by the SeaMy favorite memory is about my family. It happened a few years ago before my sister got married and movedout. We are all seven in the family. All seven of us piled in one van for a summer holiday by the beach in Sta. Ana,Cagayan. We traveled in a crowded van for several hours. My sisters and brothers are big and stout. Finally, wearrived at a small house near the beach. It had one big room with many beds and a separate room for dining andcooking. We all spent the day outside playing in the water. The water tastes salty. Later my Mama made a picnicdinner, so we sat on the sand to eat and to watch the sun set. At night, we brought out our blankets and slept by thewater. It was so much fun. We talked and stared at the stars until late at night. This summer holiday was the bestmoment of my life.Gragments and Run-on Sentences​</a>

                                            Read each text then determine its purpose. Write your answer on the space provided. ____________1. Animals live in a particular place called habitat where they can find the food they eat. There are live animals and found in the pond, forest, seas, and grassland. The food is their source of energy. In order to survive, they need a continuous supply of food. Thus, obtaining food is their life activities. ____________2. Cooking is an important part of food preparation that involves applying heat. In most cases this transforms the chemical make-up of food, altering its texture, flavor, nutritional properties and appearance. ____________3. My favorite food is broccoli. It makes me feel so healthy. I eat it every day. It makes me look so cute. There isn’t any other food That makes me feel this way. But, mostly, I like broccoli because it makes me toot. --Kenn Nesbitt ____________4. It's late, it's been a long day, you're starving, and you're too exhausted to cook. Hitting up the drive-thru seems like the best option — but we promise you, it's really not. The reasons to boycott fast food go way beyond the obvious health concerns — although caring for you (and your family's) well-being should be reason enough alone. If you take a moment to learn a little more about that extra value meal that goes down so easy, you might not like what you find. ____________5. Fried chicken is my favorite. With spaghetti or rice; With gravy or ketchup; Or with all, “That’ll be nice!” -Rose Ann B. Pamintuan ____________6. Although humans are omnivores (eating both plants and animals), many people choose not to eat meat and fish. Those who don’t eat or use any products made from animals (including eggs, dairy products and honey) are known as vegetarians or vegans.​</a>

Both of them are my favorite food because they are so delicious. My favorite spaghetti is my mother’s homemade spaghetti and she also taught me how to cook a spaghetti and for me her spaghetti was truly the best.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>    Spaghetti is my favorite because it is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water. Sometimes it is enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>      Ice cream is my favorite food too. It is a frozen dairy dessert obtained by freezing the ice cream mix with continuous agitation. It contains milk products, sweetening materials, stabilizers, colors, flavors, and egg products. It is a rich, sweet, creamy frozen food made from variously flavored cream and milk products churned or stirred to a smooth consistency during the freezing process and often containing gelatin, eggs, fruits, nuts and more. My favorite ice cream flavor is (your favorite ice cream flavor) because I think it is the best among the flavors.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>      Ice cream is my favorite dessert. My favorite ice cream is my father’s homemade ice cream it is so delicious. He taught me how to make an ice cream and told me the ingredients which is water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. I really enjoyed eating my father’s homemade ice cream.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>                                         My Favorite food</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>            My favorite food is an apple pie. It has double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or lattice. It was sweet but never cloying, with a bare hint of cinnamon. My favorite apple pie was my grandma’s homemade apple pie. </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>            For me my grandma’s apple pie was truly the best. She told me the ingredients of an apple pie which are an apple, a butter, a flour, cinnamon, egg, lemon, pie crust, juice, brown sugar and ground cinnamon. She also told me to  Toss the apples with the rest of the filling (including spices, flour, butter, and both light and brown sugars), and let it sit overnight. She taught me that the 9-inch pie must be in the oven to heat for 15-20 minutes. A 5-inch pie will take about 12-15 minutes and turnovers will take about 10-12 minutes</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>          Her apple pie is truly the best and for me no one can beat her apple pie. For my opinion an apple pie is better than tart pie. The tarts only have a bottom crust, and the crust is much thicker than a pie crust. She explained to me that the pie is a dish made by lining a shallow container with pastry and filling the container with a sweet or savoury mixture.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>      </strong></p><p><strong>         She told me to remember the secret to a great apple pie filling is to precook the apples.This will ensure perfect consistency and balanced sweetness. You'll also avoid that gap between the crust and the filling. She also told me that an apple pie is done when the juices are bubbling through the vents of the top crust or lattice. I love her apple pie and it is my number one favorite food.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            29. Read each text then determine its purpose. Write your answer on the space provided. ____________1. Animals live in a particular place called habitat where they can find the food they eat. There are live animals and found in the pond, forest, seas, and grassland. The food is their source of energy. In order to survive, they need a continuous supply of food. Thus, obtaining food is their life activities. ____________2. Cooking is an important part of food preparation that involves applying heat. In most cases this transforms the chemical make-up of food, altering its texture, flavor, nutritional properties and appearance. ____________3. My favorite food is broccoli. It makes me feel so healthy. I eat it every day. It makes me look so cute. There isn’t any other food That makes me feel this way. But, mostly, I like broccoli because it makes me toot. --Kenn Nesbitt ____________4. It's late, it's been a long day, you're starving, and you're too exhausted to cook. Hitting up the drive-thru seems like the best option — but we promise you, it's really not. The reasons to boycott fast food go way beyond the obvious health concerns — although caring for you (and your family's) well-being should be reason enough alone. If you take a moment to learn a little more about that extra value meal that goes down so easy, you might not like what you find. ____________5. Fried chicken is my favorite. With spaghetti or rice; With gravy or ketchup; Or with all, “That’ll be nice!” -Rose Ann B. Pamintuan ____________6. Although humans are omnivores (eating both plants and animals), many people choose not to eat meat and fish. Those who don’t eat or use any products made from animals (including eggs, dairy products and honey) are known as vegetarians or vegans.​</h2><br />
