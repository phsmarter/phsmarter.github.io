Copy the sentences that express opinion then underline the opinion-marking signals used in each sentence. Families are an integral part of one's life. I am confident to say that the family nerves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. It's my belief that the basic knowledge about one's culture and identity comes from the family only. I know you will have to agree that that we are a reflection of our family. In my experience, we learn to socialize through our families only and develop our intellect. From my own point of view, people who live with their families tend to be happier than ones living alone. Definitely, all the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from his family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which has made me a better person. For me, they are my first teachers and my first friends.. I will always be grateful to my family for all they have done for me. It seems to me that my life is empty without them. 1:____________________2:___________________3:___________________4:___________________5:___________________6;___________________7:_________________8:_________________9:_________________10:_________________​</a>

I am confident to say that the family nerves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. It's my belief that the basic knowledge about one's culture and identity comes from the family only. I know you will have to agree that that we are a reflection of our family. In my experience, we learn to socialize through our families only and develop our intellect. From my own point of view, people who live with their families tend to be happier than ones living alone. Definitely, all the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from his family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which has made me a better person. For me, they are my first teachers and my first friends.. I will always be grateful to my family for all they have done for me.

                        <p>1. A poor family is described as struggling financially and living a simple life, while a rich family is rich and lives in luxury.</p><p></p><p>2. The irony of the story is that, although the rich man's family is doing well financially, they are not happy and still feel the need to take advantage of the poor man's family. On the other hand, despite the economic difficulties, the poor man's family is content and happy.</p><p></p><p>3. The complaint of a wealthy neighbor who voluntarily lent money to his poor father and repaid it on time is not entirely justified. The only problem was that payments were made in small amounts, but the rich man did not set any repayment terms.</p><p></p><p>4. The way the poor father pays the rich is only because he paid on time and according to their covenant. It is unfair and unreasonable for a rich neighbor to demand full payment immediately, regardless of the poor person's financial situation.</p><p></p><p>5. Social justice is reflected in the story by describing the family of the poor man, who appears content and happy despite economic difficulties. The story emphasizes the importance of treating others fairly and not taking advantage of the underprivileged. It also emphasizes the need for empathy and understanding towards people in difficult situations.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ACTIVE VOICE</p><p></p><p>Active voice is a grammatical voice common in many of the world's languages.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I think your choice of career is affected by your interests because you will be more motivated and productive at work. There is a higher motivation if the career is aligned with one's interest. Individuals that turn interests into a career is dedicated to enhancing relevant skills and determined to achieve goals.</p><p>In choosing our careers, our socio-economic status must be considered because it helps us identify the appropriate jobs and degree that we should get.
