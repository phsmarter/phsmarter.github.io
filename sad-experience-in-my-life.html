                                            My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

Unfortunately, theexcitement turned into fear when the corona virus diseasethreatened our country in March, 2020, three days after ourfourth quarter test.President Rodrigo Roa Duterte announced that the EnhancedCommunity Quarantine will be implemented throughout Luzonand other neighboring islands from March 17, 2020 to April 30,2020. During this lockdown, it made me sad because I couldn't goto school, I couldn't play with my friends, and I couldn't do thingsI used to do. In buying our commodities, only one member of thefamily was allowed to go out. Health protocols were followed likeobserving social distancing and wearing of face masks and faceshields in public places. The need of washing the hands with soapand water or using hand sanitizers and alcohol should also bedone as often as possible to prevent the transmission of virus.These are just a few of the many changes this pandemic hasbrought to my life and to the lives of many people.I hope and pray that this pandemic will end soon so we can goback to the normal life that we used to have.1. i know the story beacause2. reminds me something of3. i can relate to the writer because​</a>

Better pay, higher position - these did not even come to mind. I prayed for direction. No position in other companies was open and no job offer came. For a year, I tried to be patient. A time came when I was no longer sad. I had accepted my place and found joy in little things. No doubt I still wanted a new job, but there was faith and assurance that God would fulfill his purpose for me and his will would be done. Soon enough, I received not one but two job offers! Trough the whole year waiting experience, I found that I became stronger and learned more about Jesus and myself. Had this been the old me, I would have just been irritated and impatient and resigned. I would have been angry and negative. But in Jesus, the former things have come. "Anxious," "weak" come be turned to "trusting", "being patient." Just goes to show that the Lord really does change our attitude in life. Answer the following questions: 1.

                                            It was sunday in the afternoon after we got to the beach we were at the church, i was so excited to swim since it has been moths that i haven’t go to the beach , so i change my formal dress off and change into my rashguard swimsuit then i met my cousins and my relative . After that we ate some lunch then I said to my cousin that we should go swimming. She said ok but we didn't know what was coming next . The level of the beach water was at our neck and there were waves but not that big . Then someone was approaching us. There were 6 boys , we were surrounded by them then they catcalled us .We couldn't do anything since they were bigger than us ….. We were really scared and on top of that they tried to touch me and my cousin . I also had to lie about where I live, but thank god I saw my sibling who is close to us, that was so that was the excuse to leave in that situation. I really don't know if i feel anger ,regret, grief or sadness i almost cried of what happened, I mean it has happened 2 times already but that kind of catcalling was the worst of them all. And after that i still can't have the courage to tell it to my family since it was my first time to be catcalled in the worst way . BASED ON A REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR GIRLS LIKE USI'mma just give mah coins but pls read my story so everyone can be aware of being catcalled ​</a>

                                            Instructions: Take a look at the critique excerpt. Discuss its characteristics (Is it formal? comprehensive? objective? oNo More Than A DreamYesterday I dreamed a remarkable dream;I was riding with a girl who was reading Blok.The little horse moved quietly. The wheels rustled.And tears fell. And a russet curl fluttered…And that was all my dream contained…But shaken by it, moved profoundly, All day, trembling with agitation, I kept thinkingOf the strange girl who had not forgotten Blok…The poem’s title, “No More Than a Dream,” appears to downplay the significance of the dream. Rather than deflating the reader’s interest, however, the title intensifies it. Dreams typically come across as impressionistic and fleeting. They seem disengaged from everyday reality, yet they are notoriously rich in meaning. The world “udivitel nyi” (remarkable, astonishing, amazing) in the opening line of the poem immediately signals that the narrator -dreamer has in fact experience something more than just a dream. The first quatrain consists of five seemingly disconnected dream frames or sequences. The image of a girl reading Blok, in the first frame is a cryptic one. Who is the girl? And what is the underlying significance of her reading Blok? The second, third, and fourth dream images suggest that the dreamer’s dream-memory of Blok is laden with nostalgic, indeed, sad and painful feelings. The positioning of I slezy kapali (and tears were falling) as an autonomous image has the effect of drawing everything animate and inanimate. – the narrator and girl, the horse, and the wheel into the vortex of an almost elegiac sadness and pain.  Yet as we shall note again, this mood of elegiac sadness is abruptly contradicted by the final image of the first quatrain, “and a russet curl fluttered,” and animated and cheerful one that not only links the girl reading Blok with Eros, but introduces a literary allusion of string importance to the poem’s interpretation. The dream has turned out to be more than just a dream, it is a revelation of the power of poetry, the power of the word, the power of memory in life and culture, the power of Blok.​</a>

                            5. My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

Unfortunately, theexcitement turned into fear when the corona virus diseasethreatened our country in March, 2020, three days after ourfourth quarter test.President Rodrigo Roa Duterte announced that the EnhancedCommunity Quarantine will be implemented throughout Luzonand other neighboring islands from March 17, 2020 to April 30,2020. During this lockdown, it made me sad because I couldn't goto school, I couldn't play with my friends, and I couldn't do thingsI used to do. In buying our commodities, only one member of thefamily was allowed to go out. Health protocols were followed likeobserving social distancing and wearing of face masks and faceshields in public places. The need of washing the hands with soapand water or using hand sanitizers and alcohol should also bedone as often as possible to prevent the transmission of virus.These are just a few of the many changes this pandemic hasbrought to my life and to the lives of many people.I hope and pray that this pandemic will end soon so we can goback to the normal life that we used to have.1. i know the story beacause2. reminds me something of3. i can relate to the writer because​</h2><br />

                            7.                         A New Name I need a job change - the office was just too far which meant little or no time for rest, prayer, and so on. Better pay, higher position - these did not even come to mind. I prayed for direction. No position in other companies was open and no job offer came. For a year, I tried to be patient. A time came when I was no longer sad. I had accepted my place and found joy in little things. No doubt I still wanted a new job, but there was faith and assurance that God would fulfill his purpose for me and his will would be done. Soon enough, I received not one but two job offers! Trough the whole year waiting experience, I found that I became stronger and learned more about Jesus and myself. Had this been the old me, I would have just been irritated and impatient and resigned. I would have been angry and negative. But in Jesus, the former things have come. "Anxious," "weak" come be turned to "trusting", "being patient." Just goes to show that the Lord really does change our attitude in life. Answer the following questions: 1.

After that we ate some lunch then I said to my cousin that we should go swimming. She said ok but we didn't know what was coming next . The level of the beach water was at our neck and there were waves but not that big . Then someone was approaching us. There were 6 boys , we were surrounded by them then they catcalled us .We couldn't do anything since they were bigger than us ….. We were really scared and on top of that they tried to touch me and my cousin . I also had to lie about where I live, but thank god I saw my sibling who is close to us, that was so that was the excuse to leave in that situation. I really don't know if i feel anger ,regret, grief or sadness i almost cried of what happened, I mean it has happened 2 times already but that kind of catcalling was the worst of them all.

                            17. Instructions: Take a look at the critique excerpt. Discuss its characteristics (Is it formal? comprehensive? objective? oNo More Than A DreamYesterday I dreamed a remarkable dream;I was riding with a girl who was reading Blok.The little horse moved quietly. The wheels rustled.And tears fell. And a russet curl fluttered…And that was all my dream contained…But shaken by it, moved profoundly, All day, trembling with agitation, I kept thinkingOf the strange girl who had not forgotten Blok…The poem’s title, “No More Than a Dream,” appears to downplay the significance of the dream. Rather than deflating the reader’s interest, however, the title intensifies it. Dreams typically come across as impressionistic and fleeting. They seem disengaged from everyday reality, yet they are notoriously rich in meaning. The world “udivitel nyi” (remarkable, astonishing, amazing) in the opening line of the poem immediately signals that the narrator -dreamer has in fact experience something more than just a dream. The first quatrain consists of five seemingly disconnected dream frames or sequences. The image of a girl reading Blok, in the first frame is a cryptic one. Who is the girl? And what is the underlying significance of her reading Blok? The second, third, and fourth dream images suggest that the dreamer’s dream-memory of Blok is laden with nostalgic, indeed, sad and painful feelings. The positioning of I slezy kapali (and tears were falling) as an autonomous image has the effect of drawing everything animate and inanimate. – the narrator and girl, the horse, and the wheel into the vortex of an almost elegiac sadness and pain.  Yet as we shall note again, this mood of elegiac sadness is abruptly contradicted by the final image of the first quatrain, “and a russet curl fluttered,” and animated and cheerful one that not only links the girl reading Blok with Eros, but introduces a literary allusion of string importance to the poem’s interpretation. The dream has turned out to be more than just a dream, it is a revelation of the power of poetry, the power of the word, the power of memory in life and culture, the power of Blok.​</h2><br />
