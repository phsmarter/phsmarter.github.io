                                            As a logical Person I know that the author has a point in promoting the legalization of marijuana however our new presidents doesnt want that because he might not know the extraction of a chemical composition of marijuana which means we can take out the bad stuff in canabis and keep the helpful chemicals. In other branches of hospitals here in the Philippines they have message about the acceptance or legalization of marijuana here in the Philippines as a medical herb that can help various diseases like Alzheimer’s, loss of appetite on chemotherapy and even HIV and AIDS. Which was said in the essay but not all. The lack of information in the essay was only the problem and questions pops in my heads that never gets unswared likeIs marijuana the only drug that can be extracted to make essential medicine for any other various diseases?If it were to be implemented, where should this plantations start and how should it be not accessible to the society? Due to the un answered questions that I have read and now think mymind changed because I remember that even though marijuana can be used essentially, it is still a dangerous drug and can cause total or even global chaos if it were to be a huge impact to the global society.pa gawa nga ito essay1st introduction 2nd body3rd conclusion ​</a>

3. Conclusion: What is your opinionabout globalization and globaleducation. Do you agree or disagree? Why?</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>Linguists assume that global education is strongly bounded to the globalization process that the world is witnessing. They clarify that pedagogy is a very effective tool to spread and instill global values in students who need to identify themselves with the new world outside their own.</p><p></p><p>As a result, there are a number of positives associated with globalization: it creates greater opportunities for firms in less industrialized countries to tap into more and larger markets around the world. this can lead to more access to capital flows, technology, human capital, cheaper imports and larger export.   Negative Effects of Globalization. It has had a few adverse effects on developed countries. Some adverse consequences of globalization include terrorism, job insecurity, currency fluctuation, and price instability.A global education is one that incorporates learning about the cultures, geographies, histories, and current issues of all the world's regions. It emphasizes the interconnectedness and diversity of peoples and histories</p><p></p><p>Technological Innovation is another notable contribution of Globalization. Most noteworthy, there is a huge emphasis on technology development in Globalization. Furthermore, there is also technology transfer due to Globalization. The technology would certainly benefit the common people.</p><p></p><p>The quality of products improves due to Globalization. This is because manufacturers try to make products of high-quality. This is due to the pressure of intense competition. If the product is inferior, people can easily switch to another high-quality product.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

Which was said in the essay but not all. The lack of information in the essay was only the problem and questions pops in my heads that never gets unswared likeIs marijuana the only drug that can be extracted to make essential medicine for any other various diseases?If it were to be implemented, where should this plantations start and how should it be not accessible to the society? Due to the un answered questions that I have read and now think mymind changed because I remember that even though marijuana can be used essentially, it is still a dangerous drug and can cause total or even global chaos if it were to be a huge impact to the global society.pa gawa nga ito essay1st introduction 2nd body3rd conclusion ​</h2><br />

Certain gases in the atmosphere act like glass in a greenhouse, allowing sunlight through to heat the earth's surface but trapping the heat as it radiates back into space. As the greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere the Earth gets hotter. This process is leading to a rapid change in climate, also known as climate change.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>When the United States ceased their Philippine colonization, they did not only leave the legacy of basketball, burgers, and, Hollywood movies. They left us a universal language, which is English.</p><p></p><p>Personally learning the language made it possible to read American classics, British tales, and, other kinds of foreign literature. Plus, it gave me confidence that I could easily communicate with other nationalities from online chatting to vacationing and studying abroad. In short, I feel English has provided me the opportunity to access a global buffet of ideas and potential foreign friendships.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it is highly valued to the point that it has become a medium of learning instruction and communication alongside Filipino. In addition to that, it created Taglish, the combination of Tagalog and English. I often hear this variation whenever I visit NCR, particularly, in the areas of Taguig and Makati. In these places, there are more well-off people, and, you can find international citizens in the locale.</p><p></p><p> Moreover, I noticed that there is a common connotation with speaking Taglish, which means a person is sosyal or associated with being rich and well-educated. This could equally mean that English fluency represents class and education. This is alarming yet no surprise for me. After all, the colonial mentality is strong in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the fact that English could threaten our Filipino pride, I believe that is key to achieving globalization because you cannot speak Tagalog in international diplomatic talks. You cannot woo investors with Cebuano or study abroad with only Hiligaynon in mind. You cannot order food in Ilocano when you're vacationing in France. In other words, we can vocally make our presence worldwide. </p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, as we speak in American slang, we must not forget to keep the Filipino pride burning through our dialects and traditions.</p><p></p><br />

                            9. What I Can Do You will write an essay for a weekly newspaper column, "Youth's Voice. This column features essays from among the youth about any current issue, may it be on a personal and family level, local community level, or national and global matters. What message or point of view on an issue will you write about as a representative of the youth today? Remember that your essay contribution will appear in the newspaper's printed and online edition. Write your essay on a separate sheet of paper. It should have a length of approximately 300 to 400 words.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a representative of the youth, I want to address an issue that may not be the most prominent in our society but affects many of us: mental health. Mental health is a subject that has been taboo for a long time, and many people still feel ashamed of talking about it or seeking help.</p><p></p><p>As a young person, I have witnessed how mental health problems have affected myself and my peers. The pressures of social media, academic success, and fitting in with our peers have led to feelings of anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts.</p><p></p><p>We need to address this issue, not only on a personal and family level, but also on a local and national level. We need to raise awareness of mental health and create a safe environment where people can talk about their struggles without fear of stigma or shame.</p><p></p><p>Our schools and communities can play an essential role in this process. We need to educate young people about mental health and the resources available to them. We need to provide access to mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, in schools and community centers.</p><p></p><p>Mental health should also be a priority in our government policies. We need to work towards creating a healthcare system that is more accessible, affordable, and provides quality mental health care for everyone.</p><p></p><p>No one should have to suffer in silence or feel ashamed of seeking help for their mental health problems. We need to work together to create a society that values and prioritizes mental health just as much as physical health.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, mental health is an urgent issue that needs more attention, awareness, and action. As a young person, I believe that we can make a difference by speaking out, supporting each other, and advocating for change. Let us break the stigma surrounding mental health and work towards a society that values and supports the mental well-being of all its members.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Power of Small Actions</p><p></p><p>As a representative of the youth today, I want to talk about the power of small actions. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the biggest issues in our world, but sometimes the biggest impact can come from the smallest actions.</p><p></p><p>For example, reducing our use of single-use plastics. It may seem like a small action, but by bringing a reusable water bottle or saying no to a plastic straw, we can collectively make a big impact on the environment. Or volunteering at a local charity or food bank. It may seem small, but it can make a world of difference to those in need and inspire others to do the same.</p><p></p><p>Small actions can also make a big difference in our personal lives. Taking a few minutes each day to practice gratitude or mindfulness can improve our mental health and well-being. Or making the effort to connect with a friend or family member, even if it's just a quick text or phone call, can strengthen relationships and make us feel more connected.</p><p></p><p>We don't need to wait for others to start making a change. We can be the change we want to see in the world, even if it's just in small ways. We can set an example for others and inspire them to join us. We can make a difference.</p><p></p><p>In a world where it's easy to feel powerless, let's remember the power of small actions. They may seem insignificant, but they can start a ripple effect that can change the world.</p><br />

What are some causes of this? How can governments and healthcare sectors solve this problem? You will make 3 paragraphs (introduction, body, and conclusion)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Climate change and global warming are two interrelated phenomena that are posing a serious threat to our planet. The impact of these two problems is so significant that they are gradually reducing the average life expectancy of individuals. While the root causes of these problems may be complex and multifaceted, some significant factors include industrialization, deforestation, and overpopulation. In this essay, we will discuss the causes of climate change and global warming, as well as the measures that governments and healthcare sectors can take to solve this problem.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>One of the primary causes of climate change and global warming is the increasing level of industrialization across the globe. The more factories and production facilities are established, the more fossil fuels are burnt, and consequently, the more greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. This, in turn, leads to the greenhouse effect, causing a rise in global temperatures. Another significant factor is deforestation, as trees play a crucial role in regulating the climate. When forests are cleared to make room for human activities such as agriculture and urbanization, the carbon-absorbing trees are destroyed, contributing to global warming. Finally, overpopulation is another significant cause of climate change and global warming, as the rising number of people on the planet leads to increased demand for resources and energy, which often results in environmental degradation.</p><p>To solve the problem of climate change and global warming, governments and healthcare sectors can take several measures. First, governments can implement regulations and policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions and promote cleaner energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Second, healthcare sectors can develop and implement programs to educate individuals about the importance of reducing their carbon footprint and taking small steps towards environmental conservation. Finally, governments and healthcare sectors can work together to promote sustainable development and environmental conservation, which can help to curb the negative impact of climate change.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, climate change and global warming are serious threats that the world is facing, and they are reducing the average life expectancy of individuals. Industrialization, deforestation, and overpopulation are some of the primary causes of these problems. However, by implementing regulations and policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions, promoting sustainable development, and educating individuals about the importance of environmental conservation, governments and healthcare sectors can play a crucial role in solving this problem</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Media and information literacy enables people to interpret and make informed decisions as users of information and media, as well as to become skilled creators and producers of their own informationgiphy and media messages. MIL is a term that combines media literacy and information literacy under one umbrella and refers to a set of competencies. Media literacy emphasizes the ability to understand media functions, evaluate how they are performed, and use them for self-expression, whereas information literacy emphasizes the importance of access to information as well as its evaluation and ethical use. It acknowledges the centrality of information and media in our daily lives. </p><p>It emphasizes free expression and information because it empowers citizens to understand the functions of media and other information providers, evaluate their content, and make informed criticism as users and producers of information and media content. </p><p></p><p>Traditionally, information literacy and media literacy have been considered separate fields. It is the strategy that combines these two fields as a set of competencies (knowledge, skills, and attitude) required for today's life and work. MIL takes into account all forms of media and other information providers, including libraries, archives, museums, the Internet, and other technology.</p><br />
