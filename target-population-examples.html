1. ... South Africa is a diverse society with multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic,
and multi-lingual attributes. It is a country that has a rich history, a history that has
contributed to how people of this society construct their lives, their identities, their
behaviors and their world-views. This study made use of this diverse context by
choosing a sample from the wide population that could be experiencing similar
challenges. The target population for this study was Black women who have
professional careers.
Nwoye further argues that in traditional African societies individuals operate
within a community and one's identity is largely influenced by sharing and
acknowledging cultural principles. He also suggests that the communal identification
comes with multiple obligations and loyalties. For example, amongst Black South
Africans in particular, there are cultural practices relating to marriage, which will be
discussed in detail in subsequent sections. These cultural practices can be seen as
socially constructed loyalties to which people adhere.</a>

                                            Random Sampling In research, collecting data can either be done in the entire population or the subset of this population called sample. If a researcher opts to use sample rather than a population, he must take considerations on the number of samples and how these samples can be chosen out of his target population. A population includes all of its elements from a set of data. The size of the population is the number of observations in the population. For example, if ABS-CBN network has 11,000 employees having the required blood type in a certain study, then we have a population of size 11,000. Sample consists of one or more data drawn from the population. It is a subset, or an incomplete set taken from a population of objects or observations. Taking samples instead of the population is less time-consuming and cost-effective. Although sampling has advantages, it can also be a source of bias and inaccuracy. Random Sampling is a sampling method of choosing representatives from the population wherein every sample has an equal chance of being selected. Accurate data can be collected using random sampling techniques. Activity Analyze the following scenarios then answer the questions that follow. a.

1. ... South Africa is a diverse society with multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic,
and multi-lingual attributes. It is a country that has a rich history, a history that has
contributed to how people of this society construct their lives, their identities, their
behaviors and their world-views. This study made use of this diverse context by
choosing a sample from the wide population that could be experiencing similar
challenges. The target population for this study was Black women who have
professional careers.
Nwoye further argues that in traditional African societies individuals operate
within a community and one's identity is largely influenced by sharing and
acknowledging cultural principles. He also suggests that the communal identification
comes with multiple obligations and loyalties. For example, amongst Black South
Africans in particular, there are cultural practices relating to marriage, which will be
discussed in detail in subsequent sections. These cultural practices can be seen as
socially constructed loyalties to which people adhere.</h2><br />

Have you imagined how Statistics affects Two of the important terms in Statistics are population and sample. Sample is a subset or part of a population A population is a set of all objects like people, animals, measurements, events. happenings or anything that one wishes to make conclusions on. A sample is a subset or a part taken from a population. Most of the time, a random sample is used to represent the population. One can make inferences about the population by carefully examining the sample. Target Population Sample For example, in your previous activity, since Mang Tomas would like to determine the preferred kind of hotdogs, he made use of 30 people representing the population of all the people passing by the street. It would be impractical to try to find all the preferred flavors of hotdogs of all the peoplepassing by the street. However, by taking a sample, one may determine all of the preferred flavors quite closely. Activity 3: Try me; I am part of a whole A.

                            28. Random Sampling In research, collecting data can either be done in the entire population or the subset of this population called sample. If a researcher opts to use sample rather than a population, he must take considerations on the number of samples and how these samples can be chosen out of his target population. A population includes all of its elements from a set of data. The size of the population is the number of observations in the population. For example, if ABS-CBN network has 11,000 employees having the required blood type in a certain study, then we have a population of size 11,000. Sample consists of one or more data drawn from the population. It is a subset, or an incomplete set taken from a population of objects or observations. Taking samples instead of the population is less time-consuming and cost-effective. Although sampling has advantages, it can also be a source of bias and inaccuracy. Random Sampling is a sampling method of choosing representatives from the population wherein every sample has an equal chance of being selected. Accurate data can be collected using random sampling techniques. Activity Analyze the following scenarios then answer the questions that follow. a.
