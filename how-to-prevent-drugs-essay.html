                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Drugs are nothing but certain substances that make you addicted to them and change your lifestyle. The change that comes within your lifestyle is mostly negative. It is known to alter reality in such a way that you forget your roots and become prone to succumbing to your bad habits. The main change comes into your mental and physical wellbeing. This gives way to financial problems and negative effects on family and even professional relationships.</p><p></p><p>Drugs are not to be taken lightly as a problem. They are something that is often taken lightly and are taken within but is soon found to be irreparable mistakes. Drug use is mostly opted for when you are trying to cope up in a situation where you are emotionally tired and you feel that taking drugs would free you of the pain. This is the reason why most of the young generation falls prey to this demon.</p><p></p><p>Drug abuse is the most problematic cause of death in the world. Around 350,000 die from overdoses of smoking, drugs, and drinking as well. It is high time that we understand the seriousness of drug abuse and stay as far as possible from it.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Prevention can be broadly defined to encompass an array of noncoercive activities intended to prevent, reduce, or delay the occurrence of drug-taking or associated complications, such as clinical syndromes of drug dependence and threats to public safety. This chapter emphasizes nonlegal, noncoercive approaches to reducing drug use in populations that are not yet seriously involved with drugs. They include efforts to educate people about the consequences of substance use, to change their beliefs about the acceptability or utility of substance use, and to increase or make more salient the costs of substance use. We address what is known, what is not known, and what data and research are needed to increase useable knowledge about the effectiveness of a wide range of approaches.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It has been discovered that most people who struggle with drug addiction began experimenting with drugs in their teens.  Teenage drug abuse is one of the largest problems in society today and the problem grows and larger every year.  Drugs are a pervasive force in our culture today.  To expect kids not to be influenced by the culture of their time is as unrealistic as believing in the tooth fairy (Bauman 140).  Teens may feel pressured by their friends to try drugs, they may have easy access to drugs, they may use drugs to rebel against their family or society, or they may take an illegal drug because they are curious about it or the pleasure that it gives them. After interviewing my teenage cousin whom has been in several altercations.</p><p>My teenage cousin advised me that after she passed the stage of being pressured by her peers to use drugs and alcohol, she began using it to make her feel better because she was suffering from depression.  Depression is the result of chemical imbalance and environmental influence.  Drugs and alcohol are the most readily available methods of emotional anesthesia, if not on hand; they would find a substitute (Henican 141).  She would use drugs when she would think about her incarcerated dad that has been in and out of her life from birth.  Her family members would try to encourage her and would often tell her, “If you continue to do the things that you are doing, you will end up like your dad incarcerated.”  She rebels against her mother and stepfather when they try to correct her and discipline her.  She doesn’t like to follow the rules at home or school and acts like she doesn’t do anything wrong.  Something psychologically is really going on with her mentally, that is one of the side effects that drugs causes.  Seeing there is no way out feeling lonely like no one cares and no prospects for improvement leads to depression.  Depression is something that many teens deal with during their lives.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Teens who experiment with drugs put their health and safety at risk. Help prevent teen drug abuse by talking to your teen about the consequences of using drugs and the importance of making healthy choices.Various factors can contribute to teen drug use and misuse. First-time use often occurs in social settings with easily accessible substances, such as alcohol and cigarettes. Continued use might be a result of insecurities or a desire for social acceptance. Teens may feel indestructible and might not consider the consequences of their actions, leading them to take dangerous risks with drugs.</p><br />

Avoid undue Peer Pressure:</p><p>Every child has his/her own choice and personality, which should be kept in mind. So a child should not be pressed unduly to do beyond his/ her capacities, be it studies, sports etc.</p><p>2. Education and counselling:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Education and counselling are very important to face problems, stresses, disappointments and failure in life. These should be taken as part of life. One should utilize a child’s energy in some other activities like sports, music, reading, yoga and other extra curricular activities.</p><p>3. Seeking help from parents and peers:</p><p>Whenever, there is any problem, one should seek help and a guidance from parents and peers. Help should be taken from close and trusted friends. This would help young to share their feelings of anxiety and wrong doings.</p><p>4. Looking for Danger Signs:</p><p>If friends find someone using drugs or alcohol, they should bring this to the notice of parents of teacher so that appropriate measures would be taken to diagnose the illness and the causes.

                        <p><strong>ESSAY ABOUT DRUG USE AND ABUSE TO ENCOUNTER:</strong></p><p></p><p>Drug abuse has a very broad impact. In a very small scope, namely oneself, it is known that drugs will cause various <strong>disturbances</strong> to the body's systems. These disturbances will interfere with the health of the user's body. If health problems have been found<strong> in high school students </strong>who are still young and have a bright future to serve the country and become good citizens.</p><p></p><p>In general, drugs can change the life of a high school student and lead him to bad things. A high school student should carry out his duties as a student by studying as much as he can and being active in various other youth activities. However, in fact, students who abuse drugs for recreational purposes cannot live life as they should. In addition, drugs also <strong>destroy a person</strong> from an economic point of view, regardless of age. </p><p></p><p><strong>Solution to Prevent or Avoid Drug Abuse</strong></p><p>The first solution that can be implemented and can be quickly applied to the wider community is <strong>public service advertisements</strong> in various media, such as cinema and social media. The reason for choosing cinema and social media as a means of spreading messages to prevent drugs is because these two media are media that, in the 21st century, are very much in demand by high school aged students.</p><p></p><p>There should be students who act as <strong>anti-drug ambassadors</strong> throughout the Philippines. Today, high school students are often friends in "exclusive" friendship groups. Thus, it is often difficult to influence such people, because they trust their friends more than experts. They trust the judgment of friends more than legally enforced law. Therefore, there needs to be representatives from each of these groups who are summoned to become representatives of anti-drug activists in their friendship groups.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> oral drugs</strong> here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/11682798</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
