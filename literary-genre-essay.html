REGION As you have learned earlier, there are different types of text that you will come across. Some of them are academic and technical, some journalistic in style, and some literary. Some examples of technical texts are scientific reports, studies, and business reports. Journalistic texts include straight news or feature articles, while literary texts include the different literary genres commonly found in literature books like poems, essays, stories, plays, and novels, among others.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>However, it is essential to note that academic writing and literary writing are two distinct types of writing.</p><p></p><p>Academic writing is a type of writing that is formal and organized, commonly used in universities, colleges, and scholarly publications. Academic writing focuses on presenting ideas and research in a clear, concise, and logical way, while providing credible sources to support arguments. This type of writing is usually objective, and facts are presented in a way that is free from personal opinions or biases. Examples of academic writing include research papers, theses, dissertations, and academic articles.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, literary writing is a type of writing that is artistic and creative in nature and often explores topics such as human experiences, emotions, and relationships. Literary writing aims to engage readers emotionally and intellectually, using figurative language, imagery, and symbolism to convey meaning. Examples of literary writing include novels, poetry, plays, and essays.</p><p></p><p>Through examining various examples of text types, you will be able to classify them based on their characteristics and understand the difference between academic and literary writing. This will help you recognize the specific purpose and intended audience of different writing styles, therefore improving your overall understanding of various types of writing.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the distinction between academic and literary writing is crucial in developing your writing skills. By being able to differentiate between the two, you can determine the appropriate writing style to use for specific tasks, which can help you meet the expectations of your audiences effectively.</p><p></p><br />

                        The coronavirus has transformed life as we know it. Schools are closed, we’re confined to our homes and the future feels very uncertain. Why write at a time like this?<br /><br />For one, we are living through history. Future historians may look back on the journals, essays and art that ordinary people are creating now to tell the story of life during the coronavirus.<br /><br />But writing can also be deeply therapeutic. It can be a way to express our fears, hopes and joys. It can help us make sense of the world and our place in it.<br /><br />Plus, even though school buildings are shuttered, that doesn’t mean learning has stopped. Writing can help us reflect on what’s happening in our lives and form new ideas.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The diversity and richness of Philippine literature evolved side by side with the country's history. This can best be appreciated in the context of the country's pre-colonial cultural traditions and the socio-political histories of its colonial and contemporary traditions. The average Filipino's unfamiliarity with his indigenous literature was largely due to what has been impressed upon him: that his country was "discovered" and, hence, Philippine "history" started only in 1521.  So successful were the efforts of colonialists to blot out the memory of the country's largely oral past that present-day Filipino writers, artists and journalists are trying to correct this inequity by recognizing the country's wealth of ethnic traditions and disseminating them in schools and in the mass media.  The rousings of nationalistic pride in the 1960s and 1970s also helped bring about this change of attitude among a new breed of Filipinos concerned about the "Filipino identity."</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
