Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                            3. What does respect have to do with you and with others?Find out more by reading the two excerpts. Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
