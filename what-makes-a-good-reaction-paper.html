                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story by Jack London explores the relationship between a man and a dog and the theme of survival. To test how cold it is, the man takes off his glove and can feel just how cold it is. The antagonist in the story is the harsh cold environment. When the man starts his third fire, his dog lays close beside it and the man understands how much his companion means to him. The man's idea of a dog is one who is loyal and understanding. A good word to describe the man is resilient as he finds ways to survive despite the treacherous environment. The man's main fear on his trip is being alone and not being able to make it back home. He makes mistakes in not understanding travelling alone, the dangers he faces, and not listening to people but he does not make a mistake in trusting his dog. The story is a heartbreaking reminder of the strength of the human spirit and the power of loyalty and friendship. My personal reaction to the story is one of sadness.</p><br />
