Not all students and teachers can afford wifi of load for their online meet or passing their outputs through online. They're also having a problem when using computers because they don't know how to use it. And it is really hard to understand those lessons because the teachers are not there to teach the lessons. Also spending too much time to computers or cellphone is bad to our health that's why many students and teachers are suffering from headaches, vision problems or worse, physical and mental damage to person. </strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For families living on the edge or in poverty. Loss of a job, reduced income, limited resources for childcare and transportation can all economically harm families without the financial savings to weather a crisis or stock up on goods to make it through.”  </p><p>“The vast majority of the 3,000 people our agency sees each year are single mothers already on the edge, and families experiencing homelessness also face unique challenges during this pandemic. Community providers like the Tarrant County Homeless Coalition and others are doing a remarkable job of coordinating the shelter flow process with enhanced health and safety precautions, as well as reaching out to feed large groups of people living on the streets. The Fort Worth Convention Center opened its doors to the homeless in March, providing additional assistance, although there are still many people afraid of living in shelter conditions right now, who are choosing to remain on the streets or in tents.”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Darwin and the Concept of a Struggle for Existence: A Study in the Extrascientific Origins of Scientific Ideas<br /><br />Darwin’s emphasis on the “struggle for existence” as the basis for natural selection is one of the most misinterpreted ideas he ever developed. Darwin had made it clear that his use of this Malthusian term was not one to be taken literally as meaning only competitive struggle but should rather be understood “in a large and metaphorical sense.”<br />As he explained in On the Origin of Species – and at greater length in his unpublished Natural Selection from which Origin was an abbreviated version – this term was to be understood as a metaphorical concept that incorporated multiple meanings. These included “dependence of one being on another,” animals that “struggle with each other” over limited food resources, plants that “struggle for life against the drought” and that “struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds.”<br />Darwin’s concept was therefore an umbrella term that he utilized to describe three unique forms of struggle: 1) Cooperative mutualism between individuals in the same species as well as between different species, 2) Competition between individuals in the same species or between one species with another, and 3) Strategies that enhance fitness when confronted by harsh environments. Any of these forms that led to greater fitness, which Darwin defined as “success in leaving progeny,” or reproductive success, would therefore be vital to understanding natural selection.<br />The overall theme of Darwin’s discussion on this metaphorical struggle can be understood through his example of a “tangled bank” in which there were overlapping layers of struggle and dependency between one species and another. For example, as Darwin explained, a parasite may depend on a certain host species for their survival and would suffer along with their host. Therefore, if the parasites were to seriously injure their animal host, or climactic changes caused their host’s primary foodsource to diminish, those parasites that could not survive in the changed circumstances could perish as well.<br />Darwin saw no better example of this complicated interrelationship between species than that of the “Misseltoe.” This hemiparasitic plant depended on specific tree species for support, specific insects for fertilization, and specific birds for the diffusion of their seeds. But there would also be a struggle over which plant produced the most seeds with the most tempting pulp for the birds, which seeds grew best if several were dropped close together, and a struggle between misseltoe and tree since the latter would suffer if they became host for too many.<br />It was here that Darwin clarified his metaphorical meaning of the term “struggle for existence” and also made it clear he was making a rhetorical choice rather than adopting what he considered to be a more accurate scientific description. As he wrote in Natural Selection (p. 187): “In many of these cases, the term used by Sir C. Lyell of ‘equilibrium in the number of species’ is the more correct but to my mind it expresses far too much quiescence. Hence I shall employ the word struggle.”<br />This concept of “equilibrium” was a common feature of early nineteenth-century economics and natural science and had Darwin employed what he deemed to be the more correct expression, the political debate over Darwinian theory may have manifested quite differently.<br /><br />

                            14. ESSAY: Why is it that some people tend to struggle to claim their freedom 
but find it difficult to face the consequence of their actions. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All over the world today, both in developing and developed states, liberal democracies and less free societies, there are groups who struggle to gain full access to freedom of expression for a wide range of reasons including poverty, discrimination and cultural pressures. While attention is often, rightly, focused on the damaging impact discrimination or poverty can have on people’s lives, the impact such problems have on free expression is less rarely addressed.</p><p></p><p>Avoiding consequences and responsibility is some people’s style. They create conflict and then they leave. Later, when it is time to share responsibilities, it’s hard to find them. This is also how criminals act. They want the benefit, but they aren’t willing to pay the price for the risk that they are taking.</p><p>This type of behavior is damaging to those on the receiving end. It is profoundly unsettling. You can spend a long time trying to solve the puzzle of why someone would act this way. It’s possible that in the end, you just end up mistrusting everyone else, and full of self-reproach. Luckily, we have it in our power to stop this from happening.</p><p>Avoiding consequences is due to shame and cynicism</p><p>Those who don’t dare to face the consequences know or have a feeling that they’ve done something wrong. In addition, they know on some level that the end doesn’t justify their means. In other words, the reasons that they had to act in a negative way aren’t valid. They lack weight, logic, honesty, and consideration for others. They are aware that their actions and motive were negative.</p><p>They consciously act against ethics and values. At the same time, there is some ambiguity: they aren’t willing to admit to others that their behavior is unacceptable. They don’t want to say that they made a mistake. Their attitude is that of embarrassment.</p><p>However, this attitude also demonstrates a lack of shame. Avoiding consequences is a way to resolve something by ignoring the other person and denying them the consideration they deserve. People who behave this way lead the other to believe that they aren’t interested in fixing the damage. They display a certain contempt for the other person (“it’s not that big of a deal”). They want the victim to deal with the consequences and accept that they can’t do anything about it. In this sense, avoiding consequences is also a form of cynicism.  They are aware of their bad behavior, and they leave the victim to fix the problem however they can.</p><p>Avoiding consequences is an obvious sign of a lack of responsibility. Societies are built on implicit and explicit collective agreements. Laws, religion, and ideology are some of the ways to communicate the importance of these agreements. They are necessary to live together in a group. We get benefits from others and we must offer something in return. This is the basic agreement.</p><p>Responsibility literally means the capacity to respond. It is something we start learning in our very first years of life. It means having an awareness of the commitments and obligations that we have to other people. Some people manage to learn that responsibility is a personal and autonomous choice. You don’t need someone looking over your shoulder to make sure you fulfill your end of the bargain. You don’t depend on others to reward or punish you, you rely instead on your own conscience.</p><p>Avoiding consequences means avoiding the obligation to be accountable for your actions. This attitude breaks commitments and, clearly, breaks trust as well. This kind of behavior also demonstrates a lack of autonomy. People who prefer to hide are prisoners of the reward-punishment framework. They act like they did when they were children, hiding when they do something wrong. </p><p>What to do with those who avoid facing consequences</p><p>A person who doesn’t want to take responsibility for their actions ends up doing a lot of damage to other people. It can be very painful when someone hurts you and doesn’t apologize. It can make you feel incredibly helpless. All things being equal, it is something like emotional deception.</p><p>This type of behavior is also a kind of manipulation. Leaving someone else to resolve a situation introduces another kind of discomfort. The absence of the person who doesn’t want to face the consequences actually creates and maintains ties to the situation. The conflict ends up in limbo and gets dragged out. The negative emotions that arise drag out as well.</p><p>When you are left alone with the responsibility to bring closure to a situation involving two or more people, you don’t have any choice but to accept the challenge. It is best to rid yourself of the fantasy of making the other person come back and take responsibility. This fantasy is part of the net of manipulation. Let go of the person who won’t face the consequences. Solve what you can and turn the page. That is the wisest thing you can do.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>feel free to make it longer :)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Title: The Unprecedented Struggles of the COVID-19 Pandemic</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most unprecedented global health crises in recent history. Since the emergence of the virus in late 2019, it has affected every aspect of our lives, from our physical health to our social and economic well-being. The pandemic has brought about countless struggles for individuals, communities, and countries worldwide.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the most significant struggles has been the loss of life. As of May 2023, the pandemic has claimed the lives of millions of people globally. Families and communities have been devastated by the loss of loved ones, and the emotional toll of the pandemic has been immeasurable. The pandemic has also put immense pressure on healthcare systems worldwide, with frontline workers risking their lives every day to provide care for the sick.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The pandemic has also highlighted and exacerbated existing social and economic inequalities. Those who were already marginalized or vulnerable have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. This includes individuals from lower-income backgrounds, those with pre-existing health conditions, and racial and ethnic minorities. These groups have faced a greater risk of exposure to the virus, as well as the economic consequences of lockdowns and job losses.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The pandemic has also led to a significant disruption of education. Schools and universities have had to adapt to online learning, which has created challenges for students, teachers, and parents. The lack of access to technology and reliable internet has further exacerbated existing inequalities, with some students falling behind in their studies.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Moreover, the pandemic has impacted mental health significantly. The uncertainty and fear surrounding the virus, combined with the isolation brought about by lockdowns and social distancing measures, have taken a toll on people's mental well-being. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide have increased worldwide, with mental health services struggling to keep up with the demand.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In addition to these struggles, the pandemic has also led to a significant economic downturn. Businesses have had to shut down, leading to job losses and financial hardship for many individuals and families. Governments have implemented various economic relief measures, but these have not been enough to alleviate the financial strain brought about by the pandemic.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about numerous unprecedented struggles. From the loss of life to the economic downturn, the pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives. As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, it is crucial to acknowledge and address these struggles to pave the way for a better future. We must work together to prioritize the health, safety, and well-being of all individuals and communities worldwide.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            25. As a student, when are your struggles in doing online class? essay.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My online classes are a convenience for me. They allow me to take additional classes that would not have fit into my schedule otherwise. I am not a traditional student, so I have non-traditional needs. Internet classes allow me to remain at home with my family. Taking Internet classes has many advantages for a non-traditional, and traditional student, such as: saving money, saving time, and most of all the convenience. Internet classes are the answer for many students with non-traditional needs. However, the only downfall to my Internet class was a computer virus, which was disastrous. I lost everything on my computer, but as for the important files I had backup on floppies. I was lucky, my sister-in-law came within a few days and fixed my computer, so I did not get too far behind. This situation should be considered when taking an Internet class. </p><p>   In my experience with Internet classes, the good far outweigh the bad. Taking Internet classes has saved me money. If I were taking traditional classes,  I would be spending about twenty dollars a week in gas alone, not to mention the wear and tear on my car. The only expense that I incur with Internet classes is my server charge, which is about twenty-five dollars a month. That means by taking Internet classes I am saving over eighty dollars a month, and that does not include wear and tear on my car. I could finance a new computer with the savings from taking online classes.</p><p>    Also, Internet classes save time, and saving time is important to me. The travel time alone is time enough for me to complete my assignments. It would take me forty-five minutes to travel to Hammond from Mandeville, and that is only one way. The extra hour and a half makes a big difference when I am a wife, a mother of three children, a full time student, and I work part time. For example, if I spend one hour a day working on my assignments, that means that I still have an extra half hour of free time each day; time that I would normally have to spend commuting to and from school.</p><p>    Furthermore, I have learned just as much online as I would have in a traditional class. I do not have the interactions with the instructor and the classmates, but I can email my instructor or my classmates at anytime. Internet classes have the discussion board where my classmates and I can exchange comments and ideas about our papers online. I do not feel as though I am missing out on anything by taking online classes. Actually, I am gaining much more that I am losing. For example, I involve my family in my Internet assignments, and I get ideas from them on assignments. I make a list like a survey, and question everyone on his or her ideas. This is a lot of fun, and it gives me ideas for my assignments. This is a learning experience for my whole family. And also, I am spending time with my family; which is difficult for a non-traditional student.</p><p>    Finally, online classes fit my lifestyle, because I am not a traditional student. If given a choice I would take all of my classes through the Internet. Online classes have saved me money and time. Also, online classes allow me to work, to be a wife and mother, and it allows me to be a full time student. The only drawback for me was when my computer crashed. Other than that my experience with online classes has been a rewarding, learning experience.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Sana makatulong</p><br />

                        <p>Answer: Life is something that requires a considerable amount of physical and mental effort. Some are fortunate enough to have everything prepared for them.  Such as some are born into money; some come across good fortune yet most work hard from the start to get some where in the world. It just all depends on how you were brought into this world. For some people, life is full of stress and hardships. That’s how life was for someone very dear to me. He had it difficult from the start. However he chose not to let life get him down. When life gave him lemons, he made lemonade. From the day that high school started, he had to work to support his seven siblings and his mother. Along with his father he worked hard to support his family while at the…show more content…
</p><p>From then on, life became easier. Then he decided to marry. He had his first child and then his second. Life was serene. Upon being given a chance for at a better life, he took it. Taking his family with him, he moved to America, Anderson, South Carolina to be exact. Since his masters originated from the UAE, it has little value in the US. His options were to either get a job or go to college. Thinking of his family, and how he needed to support them, this man decided to obtain a job at a jewelry store at the mall in Anderson. There he worked for two years as an employee until he was finally given the chance to operate the store himself. From there, over the course of four years, this man owned jewelry store all across South Carolina. He was given an opportunity to expand into other businesses and he embraced it with open arms. Soon his business had reached New York, California, Florida, and Georgia. Life once again was peaceful until the jewelry business plummeted. He sold all his stores and moved to Georgia. Now he had nothing to his name. So again, like before, he started anew. With a store opened in one year to four more over the course of three years. With the experience he had gained in life, he was able to start over from scratch. From the time he was born, this man had nothing to his name.  </p><p></p><br />
