Filipino Learners Learn the New Way The implementation of the new learning modalities is no joke! There are several opinions, beliefs, observations, and views on the new learning modalities in the Philippine education system. There are some who reacted negatively and some others embrace the new learning modalities positively. Issues on the difficulties of learners' coping on the new way of learning, teachers' way of teaching, and financial worries of parents have been raised. Undeniably, the learning modalities are truly unusual and challenging not just to learners but to the teachers as well. Delivering lessons through modules and online classes in different subjects has surely challenged the capacity and patience of learners, parents, and teachers. This entails hard work among the proponents to make things possible. Financial, physical, mental, and emotional attributions must be considered as well. Salute to all concerned individuals who have made the new normal learning modalities possible. Gradually, learners and teachers have learned to appreciate the new learning modalities. The Filipinos are hopeful that even in this time of COVID-19 pandemic, the new learning modalities would bring positive effects on the teaching-learning process in the Philippines. 1.

Filipino Learners Learn the New Way The implementation of the new learning modalities is no joke! There are several opinions, beliefs, observations, and views on the new learning modalities in the Philippine education system. There are some who reacted negatively and some others embrace the new learning modalities positively. Issues on the difficulties of learners' coping on the new way of learning, teachers' way of teaching, and financial worries of parents have been raised. Undeniably, the learning modalities are truly unusual and challenging not just to learners but to the teachers as well. Delivering lessons through modules and online classes in different subjects has surely challenged the capacity and patience of learners, parents, and teachers. This entails hard work among the proponents to make things possible. Financial, physical, mental, and emotional attributions must be considered as well. Salute to all concerned individuals who have made the new normal learning modalities possible. Gradually, learners and teachers have learned to appreciate the new learning modalities. The Filipinos are hopeful that even in this time of COVID-19 pandemic, the new learning modalities would bring positive effects on the teaching-learning process in the Philippines. 1.
