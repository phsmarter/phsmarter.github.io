FrancoBased on Edith Hamilton’s Mythology(audio recording of this story is also available)During the Golden Age of Greece, there were no women but only mortal men, the remaining Titans, and the gods of Olympus. Two brothers, Prometheus and Epimetheus, were particularly fond of mortals. So much so that Prometheus, whose name means “forethought”, deceived Zeus so that the best parts of an animal offering went to man for their food while the rest was offered to the gods.This angered Zeus. As a punishment, he created the first woman and named her Pandora. Pandora was immensely beautiful but also immensely curious about things. Zeus gave Pandora to Epimetheus, whose name means “afterthought”. Zeus also gave Pandora a box, but strictly forbade her to open it, saying that only bad things would happen if she did.It did not take long for Pandora’s curiosity to get the better of her, so she snuck a peek into the box she was forbidden to open. Immediately, plague, sorrow, mischief, and all that torment mankind to this day flew out from the box. In her terror, Pandora clamped the lid shut, not knowing that at the bottom of the box was Hope, which is why hope is the last thing man has during times of trouble.7.

FrancoBased on Edith Hamilton’s Mythology(audio recording of this story is also available)During the Golden Age of Greece, there were no women but only mortal men, the remaining Titans, and the gods of Olympus. Two brothers, Prometheus and Epimetheus, were particularly fond of mortals. So much so that Prometheus, whose name means “forethought”, deceived Zeus so that the best parts of an animal offering went to man for their food while the rest was offered to the gods.This angered Zeus. As a punishment, he created the first woman and named her Pandora. Pandora was immensely beautiful but also immensely curious about things. Zeus gave Pandora to Epimetheus, whose name means “afterthought”. Zeus also gave Pandora a box, but strictly forbade her to open it, saying that only bad things would happen if she did.It did not take long for Pandora’s curiosity to get the better of her, so she snuck a peek into the box she was forbidden to open. Immediately, plague, sorrow, mischief, and all that torment mankind to this day flew out from the box. In her terror, Pandora clamped the lid shut, not knowing that at the bottom of the box was Hope, which is why hope is the last thing man has during times of trouble.7.
