Rizal scholar Esteban de Ocampo and historian Ambeth Ocampo attest that the nationalhero was an incurable fan of written works by some of the world's best-known authors.According to them, among the late hero's favorites were the popular novels: The ThreeMusketeers, The Count of Monte Cristo, and Robinson Crusoe.2. He painted. He sculpted. He planted. He did carpentry.The superb intellect of our national hero did not stop him from also using his hands tocreate.3. Dr. Rizal had this enviable habit of overcoming the blows that life had dealt him.His mother was unjustly charged and imprisoned. He was maligned, vilified, andsubjected to an unfair trial.4. He appears to have been inspired by the adventurous, swashbuckling spirit of thesecharacters.It may be safe to assume that the major characters in those novels had a majorinfluence on Dr. Rizal.5. Imagination, child psychologists point out, is important in human development. It iswhat brings about the so-called "critical thinking" and "creative problem-solving skills."In layman's terms, these are one's abilities to see and examine all sides of a situationand to think out of the box as one searches for solutions.Source​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>He choose to annotate Morga's work because he had been rethinking the idea of the Filipino not as a people who were equal to their Spanish colonizers but a people with a unique civilization that was destroyed by colonization. Rizal found the answer to his idea in Morga's book and it was this work that he decided to reprint with his annotation. This lecture will discuss how Jose Rizal rewrote the Philippine history of his time with what has now been considered as his second major work. The Morga annotations provided the seeds of the idea of how the Filipinos should view themselves amidst a growing nationalism that eventually led to the formation of a nation.</p><p></p><p>sana nakatulong :)</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        It is important to study the life of Jose Rizal because of his input towards the independence of Philippines. He chose to fight for his country through knowledge and the power of letters. He noticed the continued suffering of his countrymen at the hands of the Spaniards and sought to put an end to this situation.<br />

Write GS for the general statement and E for the evidence onthe blank provided before the number1. Rizal scholar Esteban de Ocampo and historian Ambeth Ocampo attest that the nationalhero was an incurable fan of written works by some of the world's best-known authors.According to them, among the late hero's favorites were the popular novels: The ThreeMusketeers, The Count of Monte Cristo, and Robinson Crusoe.2. He painted. He sculpted. He planted. He did carpentry.The superb intellect of our national hero did not stop him from also using his hands tocreate.3. Dr. Rizal had this enviable habit of overcoming the blows that life had dealt him.His mother was unjustly charged and imprisoned. He was maligned, vilified, andsubjected to an unfair trial.4. He appears to have been inspired by the adventurous, swashbuckling spirit of thesecharacters.It may be safe to assume that the major characters in those novels had a majorinfluence on Dr. Rizal.5. Imagination, child psychologists point out, is important in human development. It iswhat brings about the so-called "critical thinking" and "creative problem-solving skills."In layman's terms, these are one's abilities to see and examine all sides of a situationand to think out of the box as one searches for solutions.Source​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Why Study Rizal?</p><p></p><p>It is of great importance that students understand the rationale behind having to take up a Rizal course in college.  For high school students, the Noli Me Tangere and the El Filibusterismo are injected into the Filipino subject as part of the overall curriculum.  In tertiary education, however, Rizal is a subject required of any course, in any college or university in the Philippines. </p><p></p><p>Usually, during the first day of the course, the professor asks the well-overused questions:</p><p></p><p>Why study Rizal?</p><p>What is the importance of studying Rizal?</p><p>Why is Rizal one of the minor subjects taken up in college?</p><p>Why is Rizal included in the course outline?</p><p>What relevance does Rizal have in college education?</p><p></p><p>The answer to such questions can be summed up in two points</p><br />

                            27. ESSAY ABOUT HOW DID OUR SUBJECT ON LIFE AND WORKS OF RIZAL CHANGED YOU? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has had a profound impact on my understanding of Philippine history and my own identity as a Filipino.</p><p></p><p>Before studying Rizal, I had a limited understanding of the events that led to the Philippines becoming a colony of Spain, and the subsequent struggle for independence. Through reading Rizal's writings, such as "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo", I gained a deeper understanding of the injustices and oppression that the Filipino people faced during that time. Rizal's writings not only exposed the injustices and corruption of the Spanish colonial government, but also highlighted the resilience and determination of the Filipino people to fight for their rights.</p><p></p><p>Rizal's writings also helped me to better understand the Philippines' cultural identity. Rizal was a true patriot, and his works were infused with pride in the Philippines' unique culture and history. Through his writings, I learned about the customs, traditions, and beliefs of the Philippines, which helped me to appreciate my own heritage.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Rizal's writings also helped me to develop a sense of social responsibility. Rizal was not only a writer, but also a reformer who advocated for the rights of the Filipino people. His example of standing up for what is right, even in the face of oppression, has inspired me to become more engaged in the issues that affect my community and to take action to make a difference.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has changed me in many ways. It has broadened my understanding of Philippine history and culture, and has inspired me to become more socially responsible. Rizal's legacy continues to be a source of inspiration for all Filipinos, and I am proud to be a part of that legacy.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Please you can my question about the subject RIZAL today. Thank you!</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There is one issue in Jose Rizal’s life that historians have debated on several occasions but remains unsettled. That issue is whether Rizal, on the eve of his death, re-embraced the Catholic faith and disassociated himself from Masonry. The matter is controversial because parties on both sides are affiliated with an organization that promotes moral values and the pursuit of truth. The pro-retraction camp is represented by the Jesuits, the archbishop of Manila, and a few other members of the Catholic hierarchy. Since they are all ordained priests, they are assumed to be truthful in their pronouncements. Their opponents are the members of Masonry, an organization that promotes brotherhood, integrity, decency, and professionalism.</p><p>      This paper resurrects the retraction controversy in the light of the emergence of another primary source that speaks about what happened to Rizal on the eve of his death. This document was never considered in the history of the retraction controversy because it was made available to researchers only in the past decade. The author of the report is a credible eyewitness because he was physically present in the vicinity of where Rizal was detained. His narrative is lucid and contains details that cast doubt on the credibility and reliability of earlier primary sources on which previous narratives were based. This document needs serious consideration and should be included in the discourse on Rizal’s retraction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>that is my answer po</p><p>hope it helps po</p><p>God bless you</p><br />
