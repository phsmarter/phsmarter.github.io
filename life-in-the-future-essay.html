                            4. Martin Luther King Jr. often spoke of a day in the future when he hoped that his children would be judged not by their skin color but instead by their character. Write a narrative essay about a moment in your life when you were judged by something other than the content of your character. Use narrative techniques to develop experiences, events, and characters.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Tips on how to write the essay are given below<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr spoke of a day in the future when he hoped that his children would be judged not by their skin color but instead by their character.  Most of his speeches revolve around the injustice brought upon Black people. For the longest time, Black people were discriminated upon and even if there are those who were given a chance and became successful in life were still seen as inferior citizens. </p><p></p><p>In his famous "I Have a Dream" speech he  dreamed of having a segregation and racism-free world.

                            11. IF YOU WERE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO SEE YOUR FUTURE SELF, WHAT THREE LIFE ADVICE WOULD YOU REMIND YOUR FUTURE SELF OF? (Essay 5 paragraph)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Doing this exercise can be a really insightful experience.
</p><p>
</p><p>Imagine writing to your future self 5 years from now — what would you say? What kind of person would you be? What goals would you want to have achieved? Not only is it mind boggling, but it gets you thinking about your goals 5 years from now. As you write your letter, you will start to think about the actions you should take to realize them in your expected time frame.
</p><p>
</p><p>Subsequently when you open your letter 5 years down the road, you get to assess the things that match (or don’t match) up vs. your expectations, and reflect why that’s the case. Often times, our goals are subject to a lot of changes due to unanticipated circumstances and changing priorities. Reading your letter lets you see how your life trajectory has changed since writing it. It also makes you pause and think about how you are doing, and whether you are where you want to be in life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            12. Write an essay relating a real life situation to the story of romeo and juliet pointing out that the said story will not give the youth of today a better future. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the opening Prologue of Romeo and Juliet, the Chorus refers to the title characters as “star-crossed lovers,” an allusion to the belief that stars and planets have the power to control events on Earth. This line leads many readers to believe that Romeo and Juliet are inescapably destined to fall in love and equally destined to have that love destroyed. However, though Shakespeare’s play raises the possibility that some impersonal, supernatural force shapes Romeo and Juliet’s lives, by the end of the play it becomes clear that the characters bear more of the responsibility than Fortune does.</p><p>Though the Prologue offers the first and perhaps most famous example of celestial imagery in Romeo and Juliet, references to the stars, sun, moon, and heavens run throughout the play, and taken as a whole that imagery seems to express a different view of human responsibility. In Act 1, scene 4, Romeo says that he fears “some consequence yet hanging in the stars” when he and his gang approach the Capulet’s ball. In his next mention of stars, however, Romeo doesn’t refer to their astrological power. Rather, he uses the image of stars to describe Juliet’s otherworldly beauty. Most of the subsequent celestial images in the play follow in this vein, from Romeo’s love-struck comparison of Juliet to the sun to Juliet’s own wish to “cut [Romeo] out into little stars” when he dies. Throughout the play, these astral images are more often associated with the two lovers than with divine fate, emphasizing that, as the play’s action escalates, we cannot simply place the blame for the tragedy on some impersonal external force.</p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>A career can be defined as a person's progress within an occupation or series of occupations. However, a career is more than just a job, or working, or your occupation. It also includes your progress through life, your growth and development in vocational and avocational areas of life. Deciding on your initial career may present a stressful and frightening prospect. Many tend to perceive career decision-making as complex or even mysterious, only because they tend to concentrate on the outcome and overlook the decision-making and planning process. Successful career decisions are based on current and accurate information. Today, career information is abundant and easily accessible. While this is exciting and potentially helpful, it can also be overwhelming. Nevertheless, one major fact emerges from the mass of data and literature available: effective career planning is a process that involves the total person. Comprehensive career planning stresses the importance of knowing enough about your unique attributes, about specific career fields, and about your life priorities.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            27. Directions Answer what is asked in each item Discuss onefly 1.) Biff claims he has made every attempt to avoid wasting his fe but he fees ke a failure every time he returns home. What type of life or career would make B feel successful? Why is he so critical of himself whenever he returns to New York? 2.) Compare and contrast Willy's conflicting images of Biff Why does he defend him and criticize him?3.)

Linda states "life is a casting off" Explain her statement in relation to the play 5.) Write an essay explaining Way's philosophy "Be liked and you will never want How does this statement apply to Way? To Charley? To Howard? To Beard?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1) Biff would feel successful in a life or career that allows him to pursue his dreams, instead of taking the route his father had expected of him. He is so critical of himself because he believes he has failed to meet his father's expectations. </p><p></p><p>2) Willy's conflicting images of Biff are that he is a talented, ambitious, and successful young man, and also a thief, a liar, and a quitter. Willy defends Biff and is proud of him when he believes Biff is following the path he wanted for him, but he is also critical and disappointed when Biff strays away from this path. </p><p></p><p>3) Biff's tendency to steal is driven by his need to prove himself, his desire to have control over his life, and his attempt to escape from his father's expectations. His actions shape his future because they create further distance between him and his family and they lead him to a life of crime and instability. </p><p></p><p>4) Linda's statement that "life is a casting off" means that life is a process of letting go of the past, of letting go of the people and things that no longer serve you, and of moving forward. In the play, this statement applies to Biff's journey to finally let go of his father's dreams for him and to find his own path. </p><p></p><p>5) Willy's philosophy that "Be liked and you will never want" means that if people like and admire you, you will always have their support, and you will never have to worry about going without. This statement applies to Willy because he believes that if he is liked, he will be successful, and he will never want for anything. It applies to Charley because he has been successful, in part due to his being liked. It applies to Howard because he is a successful businessman, and he has many people like and admire him. It also applies to Beard because he is well-liked and respected in his community.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>College is my first step to achieve my dream. Currently I am a student in high school. I do my best to keep my grades up, because I know that they will help me into college. I dream of going to UCSD to get a bachelors degree in biology, then coming back to Stockton to attend UOP and getting a Doctorates degree in Pharmacy. By the time I get this degree, I will be around 28, so I hope that it will all be worth it.             After I have a doctorate, I plan to get a job working for a company under their research division. I hope I can lend a hand in finding new, more effective ways of administering drugs to patents. Or I could possibly design self-administration drugs for those at home type of people. Or perhaps I could improve packaging designs for the medication. The possibilities are endless!             Outside of my job, I plan to buy a large home. I dream of settling down in an urban area, someplace that's not too big. A Stockton type of town, but not Stockton. Possibly Monterey or Carmel. Hopefully by the time I get a house, I'll have a wife and can start a family. I dream of having a son to carry on the family name.             As you can see, I have big plans for my future. I plan to make something of myself, and not to give up. I have a major fear of failure, and I won't let it get to me. My parents expect a lot out of me, and I think I have done a good job so far. My dreams are what keep me going; they are an object for me to strive for. I will obtain that object one day.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>SANA MAKATULONG</p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO</p><p>PWEDE POBA KAHIT BIOLOGY??</p><br />
