                                            Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs in the correct order to arrive at a persuasive essay. Write 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th on the space provided.            _____ Some people think that automatic hand dryers don‘t dry their hands as thoroughly as paper towels. People stand in front of the hand dryers for just a few seconds, and they are disappointed that their hands do not feel dry. However, studies have shown that when people dry their hands for at least 30 seconds, automatic dryers actually dry much better than paper towels. It is difficult to get every part of your hand dry using paper towels. The blast of air makes sure that your hands are completely dry… if you take a few extra seconds. _____In addition, if the school buys automatic hand dryers, we can save money that can be spent on more important things. I have noticed that there is a terrible waste of paper towels in the restrooms. Students continuously pull on the lever, dispensing towels that they do not really need. It is annoying to find the dispenser empty. Our custodian is called several times a day to bring in bundles of replacements, just because some kids are wasteful. All of these paper towels cost a lot of money. An automatic hand dryer cost costs approximately $500, with very little additional cost over time. On the other hand, paper towels can cost $25 a case, or about $500 a year, since we use about 20 cases each year.After just one year, it would pay for itself. If we installed automatic hand dryers, we would not waste paper towels, and it would save the school a ton of money._____First of all, the automatic hand dryer is very sanitary. Instead of pulling on a lever that has been touched by a large number of students, users can just stick their hands under the air dryer. No germs can get on them because there is nothing to touch. Just think how the attendance rate would improve. Kids wouldn‘t get sick from the germ-infested paper towel dispensers we now use at our school. This would keep kids‘ hands germ-free. _____Keeping kids healthy, saving money, and helping our school stay clean are strong reasons for installing automatic hand dryers. Every day that goes by without having them means that we are continuing to have problems in our restrooms because we are using paper towels. Let‘s install automatic hand dryers as good as possible! Testing the Quality of My Reasons - Sample Issue and Point of View: Automatic motion-sensing hand dryers should be used in all school restrooms. Weak Reasons (probably won‘t convince my audience).* They are fun to use.* They warm your hands on cold days. * They dry your hands quicker than paper towels._____Finally, our bathroom is a paper towel mess! There are always piles of paper towels on the floor. Sometimes the extras fall from the dispenser unused. Many times kids bunch their used towels into a ball and aim for a basket. But if they miss the target, the paper ball stays on the floor. Sometimes the towels are even tossed to the ceiling like spitballs. Paper towels leave so much litter in the restrooms that the restrooms are a mess—even before the end of the day!_____Although some people don‘t like using hand dryers in restrooms, it may actually be argued that the motion-sensing hand dryers are a practical alternative to paper towels. More and more businesses are investing in automatic hand dryers keep the restrooms cleaner. I believe that our school would benefit from investing in automatic motion-sensing hand dryers in all the restrooms.​​</a>

                                            pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

                                            Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center.

                                            ParagraphDirections: Read and understand the paragraphs below, then answer the questions thatfollow. Write them on the second column.Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty tolook at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food,fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, morethan half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if deforestationcontinues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, andanimals will die.One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use lesspaper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answeris to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper.

Without air and water, the Earth would be unable to sustain life.</strong><p><strong></strong></p><strong>A diverse community of plant and animal life has thrived on this planet for millions of years, sustained by the sun and supported by the soil, water and air.</strong><p><strong></strong></p><strong>Definition of air pollution</strong><p><strong></strong></p><strong>Air pollution occurs when the air contains gases, dust, fumes or odor in harmful amounts.

There are at least sixty sources of household air pollution, and these vary from country to country. Indoor tobacco smoking, construction material used in building houses, fuel used for cooking, heating and lighting, use of incense and various forms of mosquito repellents, use of pesticides and chemicals used for cleaning at home, and use of artificial fragrances are some of the various sources that contribute to household air pollution.</p><p></p><p>Household air pollution affects all stages of life with multi-systemic health effects, and its effects are evident right from pre-conception to old age. In utero exposure to household air pollutants has been shown to have health effects which resonate over the entire lifetime. Exposures to indoor air pollutants in early childhood also tend to have repercussions throughout life. The respiratory system bears the maximum brunt, but effects on the cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and nervous system are largely underplayed. Household air pollutants have also been implicated in the development of various types of cancers.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            6. Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs in the correct order to arrive at a persuasive essay. Write 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th on the space provided.            _____ Some people think that automatic hand dryers don‘t dry their hands as thoroughly as paper towels. People stand in front of the hand dryers for just a few seconds, and they are disappointed that their hands do not feel dry. However, studies have shown that when people dry their hands for at least 30 seconds, automatic dryers actually dry much better than paper towels. It is difficult to get every part of your hand dry using paper towels. The blast of air makes sure that your hands are completely dry… if you take a few extra seconds. _____In addition, if the school buys automatic hand dryers, we can save money that can be spent on more important things. I have noticed that there is a terrible waste of paper towels in the restrooms. Students continuously pull on the lever, dispensing towels that they do not really need. It is annoying to find the dispenser empty. Our custodian is called several times a day to bring in bundles of replacements, just because some kids are wasteful. All of these paper towels cost a lot of money. An automatic hand dryer cost costs approximately $500, with very little additional cost over time. On the other hand, paper towels can cost $25 a case, or about $500 a year, since we use about 20 cases each year.After just one year, it would pay for itself. If we installed automatic hand dryers, we would not waste paper towels, and it would save the school a ton of money._____First of all, the automatic hand dryer is very sanitary. Instead of pulling on a lever that has been touched by a large number of students, users can just stick their hands under the air dryer. No germs can get on them because there is nothing to touch. Just think how the attendance rate would improve. Kids wouldn‘t get sick from the germ-infested paper towel dispensers we now use at our school. This would keep kids‘ hands germ-free. _____Keeping kids healthy, saving money, and helping our school stay clean are strong reasons for installing automatic hand dryers. Every day that goes by without having them means that we are continuing to have problems in our restrooms because we are using paper towels. Let‘s install automatic hand dryers as good as possible! Testing the Quality of My Reasons - Sample Issue and Point of View: Automatic motion-sensing hand dryers should be used in all school restrooms. Weak Reasons (probably won‘t convince my audience).* They are fun to use.* They warm your hands on cold days. * They dry your hands quicker than paper towels._____Finally, our bathroom is a paper towel mess! There are always piles of paper towels on the floor. Sometimes the extras fall from the dispenser unused. Many times kids bunch their used towels into a ball and aim for a basket. But if they miss the target, the paper ball stays on the floor. Sometimes the towels are even tossed to the ceiling like spitballs. Paper towels leave so much litter in the restrooms that the restrooms are a mess—even before the end of the day!_____Although some people don‘t like using hand dryers in restrooms, it may actually be argued that the motion-sensing hand dryers are a practical alternative to paper towels. More and more businesses are investing in automatic hand dryers keep the restrooms cleaner. I believe that our school would benefit from investing in automatic motion-sensing hand dryers in all the restrooms.​​</h2><br />

                            7. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</h2><br />

Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> <strong>AIR </strong><strong>POLLUTION</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Due to urbanization and environmental change, there is a high extraction of toxic gases. So, there is no single reason for changing air quality. As you find some change in air due to some physical, chemical and biological changes, air pollution takes place in nature.  There might be some inclusion of some unsafe material on earth that does not let you inhale well.Nowadays, air pollution in our country has become a bane of our existence. It is not only a problem in our country but the countries all over the world are affected by it. The effects of air pollution are felt especially in the metropolitan cities because of the growing levels of industrialization. The discharge of air pollutants such as concentrates, smog, solid materials etc are settling over the cities. Excess amount of machinery, use of harmful gases, and use of methane are causing the air pollution. The population’s heavy production of waste is the main reason that the air pollution is increasing rapidly. It become a big problem these days. It has caused a lot of damage to the mankind, wildlife and personal property. It has affected the lives of humans and animals, causing a lot of health disorders. It is become one of the biggest reasons for the reduction in the quality of life. The reason, its increasing so rapidly is because of the increase in the number of industries. Air pollution causes fog, smog and introduces a lot of harmful gases in the environment that has greatly affected the humans with diseases like asthma, bronchitis and many lung diseases. The pollution emitted from one industry does not stay at one place and spreads rapidly and affects the atmosphere and the species very much.Air pollution is constantly damaging the whole biological system. It has reached a stage where its affecting the earth as the harmful radiations are able to reach deep into our atmosphere and cause a lot of damage.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>AIR POLLUTION</p><p>*introduction/argument</p><p></p><p>Earlier the air we breathe in use to be pure and fresh. But, due to increasing industrialization and concentration of poisonous gases in the environment the air is getting more and more toxic day by day. Also, these gases are the cause of many respiratory and other diseases. Moreover, the rapidly increasing human activities like the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation is the major cause of air pollution.</p><p></p><p>*body</p><p></p><p>The fossil fuel, firewood, and other things that we burn produce oxides of carbons which got released into the atmosphere. Earlier there happens to be a large number of trees which can easily filter the air we breathe in. But with the increase in demand for land, the people started cutting down of trees which caused deforestation. That ultimately reduced the filtering capacity of the tree.</p><p></p><p>*Solution</p><p></p><p>Although the level of air pollution has reached a critical point. But, there are still ways by which we can reduce the number of air pollutants from the air</p><p>-Reforestation- The quality of air can be improved by planting more and more trees as they clean and filter the air.</p><p></p><p>-Policy for industries- Strict policy for industries related to the filter of gases should be introduced in the countries. So, we can minimize the toxins released from factories.</p><p></p><br />
