                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Employers ask "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?" to see if you can grow with their company. They want to learn if your long-term goals align with those of the company. A candidate they can anticipate will stay awhile is a better investment than one they expect to leave after a year or less.
</p><p>
</p><p>That's why it's good to show you want to gain more experience in the role you're applying for and eventually get promoted to a higher-level position when you're ready. Show interviewers they should invest in your talent and skills and the payoff will be worth it for the company.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The answer most thought-inducing and appealing is no plan at all. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>We are not bound to know what'll happen in the future for we are in a world of boundless possibilities. Focus on making the present successful and see the beauty of tomorrow.</p><br />

                            12. Where do you want to go? In our present situation, there are restrictions that have to be followed. You might already be missing a lot of things especially seeing places, events and people. But more than that, where do you really want to go? Have you ever tried to seriously ponder on where do you see yourself, maybe 10 or 15 years from now? Have you also imagined what you would be wearing, in what kind of environment you would be working or what you would be enjoying doing for eight hours or more of your day?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>How to answer "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"
</strong></p><p><strong>To answer "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?" successfully, consider these steps:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Do your research
</strong></p><p><strong>Show your interviewer you're prepared by researching the company and the position. You should know what the company does and who their clients are. You can find this information on their company website and social media accounts. Additionally, read the job description multiple times. Reading it again right before your interview can help you remember it more easily.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2. Imagine your future
</strong></p><p><strong>Along with being prepared, it's a good idea to sit down and think about your future. Think about what kind of job you hope to have in 10 years. Employers may ask different variations of this answer, so think about where you want to be one, five and 10 years from now.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. Relate your answer to the job
</strong></p><p><strong>To impress interviewers, make your answer related to the job and the company you're interviewing for. They want to hear that you have long-term plans to stay at their company. Explain that you want to grow in your role and take on more responsibilities as time progresses.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>4. Be ambitious, yet realistic
</strong></p><p><strong>Show the interviewers you are a goal-oriented person who is ambitious to grow in this position. However, at the same time, be realistic in your answer. They want someone with a true understanding of the role. Saying that you hope to be in a leadership role is much more realistic than saying you'll be the head of the company in 10 years.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>5. Tell them what you want
</strong></p><p><strong>Though you should have your answer relate to the job, it's also important to share what you want in a career. If you are the right candidate for the job, the interviewer could remember what you said during the interview and design the role based on your wants.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>6. End your answer with a question
</strong></p><p><strong>Remember, interviews are an opportunity for you to get your questions about the company and the role answered. By asking pointed questions, you make it clear that you are genuinely interested in the position. A helpful follow-up question to ask is "What are some short- and long-term goals for the company?" You could also ask "What are your long-term goals for someone in this role?"</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>           Everyone has dreams. Weather they be to become a scientist and discover new and amazing things, or become a star basketball player and be the highest paid player in the league, people dream about their future. I have dreams for the future just like everyone else. Dreams of the good life, with lots of money, hot girls, and fast cars! And I will do whatever it takes to achieve it.After I have a doctorate, I plan to get a job working for a company under their research division. I hope I can lend a hand in finding new, more effective ways of administering drugs to patents. Or I could possibly design self-administration drugs for those at home type of people. Or perhaps I could improve packaging designs for the medication. The possibilities are endless!</p><p>             Outside of my job, I plan to buy a large home. I dream of settling down in an urban area, someplace that's not too big. A Stockton type of town, but not Stockton. Possibly Monterey or Carmel. Hopefully by the time I get a house, I'll have a wife and can start a family. I dream of having a son to carry on the family name.</p><p>             As you can see, I have big plans for my future. I plan to make something of myself, and not to give up. I have a major fear of failure, and I won't let it get to me. My parents expect a lot out of me, and I think I have done a good job so far. My dreams are what keep me going; they are an object for me to strive for. I will obtain that object one day. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>MY GOALS FOR NOW IS TO BE A CHEF AND I WANT TO REACH MY DREAMS SO I CAN HELP MY PARENT</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>YUN LNG</p><br />
