“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</a>

                        <p></p><p></p><p>"Random act of kindness"</p><p></p><p>Kindness simply means being good to people around us. It can be done by being polite to them, offering them emotional support, helping them financially, boosting their morale or by simply being supportive to them. Kind words and kind deeds done by us are not only a boon for the recipient but are also a blessing to us. When we help others with their tasks, are polite to them and do other such acts of kindness it gives us a sense of accomplishment and joy.</p><p></p><p>Kindness has been described differently in different religious books and literature in the past. However, they all echo the same thought. All of them advocate that human beings must show kindness to other human beings as well as other creatures. We must be polite, friendly and helpful. While we should exhibit kindness we must not do it with the aim of getting anything in return. Kindness is a selfless act.</p><p></p><p>If God has been kind enough to give us the things we need we must be kind to others and render help in whatever way we can. As Lord Buddha said, “A generous heart, kind speech and a life of service and compassion are the things that renew humanity”.</p><p></p><p>hope it helps :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Give a Compliment, Tell someone that you care about them by complimenting them. It can be a big compliment or a small one. The point is that you share what good you see in them. That will help them develop confidence and a stronger sense of self.  Volunteer, There’re many reasons why doing voluntary work is good for you. Find a good cause you care about and give your time to it. Serve in some way. Volunteering transforms your hard work into other people’s happiness. This is one of the most common acts of kindness that you can do.  Contribute to a Charity, Similarly, charities also contribute to other people’s happiness even with minimal effort from you. If you can’t serve a charity or nonprofit, you can give financially or even raise money with a fundraiser. Volunteering and contributing to charity are acts of kindness that require sacrifice but are definitely worth it. Visit Someone, People may know you care but are you present with them? It’s best to give your time to those you care about and show them that they matter to you. Go and visit them while you can. This simple act of kindness can go a long way. Show Empathy, Show empathy – feel what someone else is feeling. Put yourself in their place. They may need that, and this shows that you understand what they are going through, which can help make them feel better. Showing empathy is one of the simplest yet best ways acts of kindness can manifest.  Point out the Positive for Someone, Not everyone can see the positive side of things, especially if they are going through very rough times. It may make their day though if you show it to them. Then, they can enjoy it, too.  Give Input or Advice, Someone may benefit from what you know. You may have the experience that they don’t have. When you give input about something using your expertise (whether a little or a lot), you are more appreciated for doing so. Valid criticisms and feedback are always welcome, and they may even help others improve their situation. Tell Someone That They Matter, People don’t always know their worth. Some people don’t recognize that they and what they do matter to others. If you tell them that they are worthwhile, they will feel better and be able to do better. They will look to you for strength at first, then to themselves. Also, Kindness acts very strongly against all these ill habits and can help to make this world a better place to live. Kindness acts like a eliminator of all such harmful things that exist in this world and provides peace to everyone's mind. “Constant kindness can accomplish much.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The act of kindness I can do to make a better world is showing respect,love,care for my family,I will start at home to have a positive outcome. By also helping others,doing voluntary work in the community,Volunteering transforms your hard work into other people’s happiness, I will also Contribute to a Charity or i will help them to raise a fund. Showing care to others,It’s best to give your time to those you care about and show them that they matter to you.Showing empathy to others,they may need that, and this shows that you understand what they are going through, which can help make them feel better.Be Honest
,</p><p>this may just be a simple act of kindness, but people will feel respected if you are honest with them. It may not solve everything, but it helps them know you are trustworthy and that you care about them.Even in simple ways, taking care of the environment is important in making the world a better place. You must care about nature and its value. We are connected to nature, and nature is a big part of our world. Show love  to others,</p><p>Love makes the world go round. Love is the ultimate manifestation of kindness. And when you love someone, let them know it. Let them feel that you are in their life for the right reasons and that you want to be there for them.Learn to forgive,second chances give us more life. It’s not just for them, it’s for us.Sometimes, the little things we do can already save or change the lives of others. Make the world a better place by saving those within it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power.

                            14. Original text:
“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</h2><br />

In comparison to a personal essay, a formal essay is more meticulously planned and serious. Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman who lived between the mid-1950s and the early 1600s, is credited with creating the formal essay. His works cover topics like death, fear, truth, and riches and are condensed, impartial, and informed. The writing style of a personal essay is informal and conversational. The informality of the personal essay is one of its main qualities. Its primary goal is to pique interest, with informational value coming second. As a result, compared to the formal essay, it is a more aesthetic and less practical type of production.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
