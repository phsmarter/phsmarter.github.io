Use narrative techniques to develop experiences, events, and characters.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Tips on how to write the essay are given below<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr spoke of a day in the future when he hoped that his children would be judged not by their skin color but instead by their character.  Most of his speeches revolve around the injustice brought upon Black people. For the longest time, Black people were discriminated upon and even if there are those who were given a chance and became successful in life were still seen as inferior citizens. </p><p></p><p>In his famous "I Have a Dream" speech he  dreamed of having a segregation and racism-free world. Segregation was the separation of whites from Blacks.  While this is no longer practiced today, racism is still very much true and most people are judged by external appearances. </p><p></p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: As the assignment calls for a narrative, write a story related to the paragraphs above. Here are some guide questions:</p>Was there a time you were discriminated because of how you look, the way you dress or you skin color? How about the way you speak?Who discriminated you and what did you do and feel during that time?Why is it not right to judge by external appearances?<p></p><p>At the end of the essay, highlight how your experience lead you to become more sensitive to the circumstances of other people and that judging by external appearances is not good.</p><p></p><p>For more information:</p><p>Martin Luther King Jr: https://brainly.ph/question/1125905</p><br />

                        <p>Short Essay <strong>My Life in Pandemic</strong></p><p>COVID-19 has a cost. Many lost jobs, homes, and lives due to this pandemic. The infection affected my mood. For three months, I was scared and annoyed by how this virus was treated. I thought this virus might infect my family. I was told to practice personal hygiene and social distancing each time I brought it up. During the summer, I worked on my mental health. Before I got home from school, I was anxious. I wanted to eliminate my panic after realizing how anxious I was.</p><p>So I did group therapy. I attended a few programs. They all focused on anxiety and how to deal with it. Three months ago, I created a new connection with my anxiety. This tool helped me spot early indicators of a panic attack. Our group therapist offered us techniques to use when anxious. I am grateful for the result because I was patient with myself and did my homework to practice imageries and ten connected breaths. There are other ways to combat panic attacks, but they worked for me.</p><p>Being home all summer made me work out more. During my first year, I scarcely exercised, damaging my mood. I stay healthy and positive by exercising regularly. Besides being happier, I was in better shape. The Pandemic put me in lockup for a month. I chose to work out at home to stay healthy without a gym. My body transformed after so much exercise, and I'm glad.</p><p>In the previous month, the pandemic impacted my family hard. Financially and emotionally, my family suffered. I have a compassionate and generous family who will aid anyone in need. It's hard to witness loved ones struggle mentally and emotionally. Pandemics exacerbate anxiety and despair. Though it hurts to watch my family in trouble, I attempt to help. I've learned that having someone to listen to and console you is a blessing. Throughout the summer, I've learned to find the brightness even in gloomy moments.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about another short essay:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2721738</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>My New-found Interest</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>A few years ago, I have discovered that <strong>I like reading books</strong>, especially ones that are more obscure and unique. I discovered this when I visited our school library for some reference material. I do not usually go to the library, as almost all information that I need can already be found on the internet. But during that time, I needed to have a hardcopy reference. Therefore, I spent some time in the library. Who knew that it could actually lead it to my love for reading? I did not realize yet that time it was actually the beginning.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Magical Moment</strong>
</p><p>I remember that I was looking for a particular science book for my reference. It was crunch time already with my report, so I must find that science reference. However, while I was looking, I came across this old book about a young girl and her desire to have a swimming pool in their backyard. The book cover was nondescript, just an image of a young girl in pig tails. It was hard bound with olive green color and smelled really old and musty. I am not sure why I started reading it, but I actually did! And I was so excited about it! Eventually I was able to find my science reference and borrowed my new-found book together with it. </p><p></p><p><strong>My Future Career?</strong>
</p><p>Until today I kept asking myself, why did I ever get interested to open that book in the library? Was there some magical moment or some divine intervention leading me to that book? But in any case, that incident got me started into reading. After that, I would visit the library to look for other similar books. Furthermore, it developed in me an inclination to look online for books with good reviews. And I get to spend many days in bookstores in malls. There are bookstores that allow people to stay inside, lounge in the store, and read some books. I like doing that in some of my free time. Also, I have this feeling that I must at least read one physical book for every five online books I read. I also started following online writing platforms and fanfiction websites. I needed to see which ones are new releases and if they are actually good. Nowadays I am getting interested in pursuing creative writing. I want to learn how to be a creative writer. Who knows! One day that might be a career I am willing to take in the future.
