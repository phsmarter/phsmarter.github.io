                                            Answer the case situation using the 7-step moral reasoning model. Kate is a 17 years old patient, unmarried and 8 weeks pregnant. She is a rather remarkable girl in that she lives independently while still a senior in a high school. She tells you that she was an adoptee given back to foster care, and then abused in that system. She is now an emancipated minor who works 30 hours per week at a service industry job while also earning a 4.0 GPA in school, ranking in the top 10% of her class. She is college-bound, with a full-ride scholarship for pre-med undergraduate studies at a prestigious university. Kate has absolutely no family support, and the former boyfriend who is the father of her unborn child/fetus simply disappeared upon learning of the pregnancy. Your patient is scared, uninsured, and says she doesn’t want to be pregnant or a mom (“Perhaps someday, but not now!”). She rejects the adoption option, based on her own experience growing up, and requests abortion only, at this hospital where she has always received medical care.” Your faith-based health care system rejects elective abortion option. What ought to be done for Kate? And by whom? 3.Review relevant ethical guidelines. ? 4. Obtain consultation. (additional info) ? 6. Compare the alternative with the principles?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Moral reasoning is a process by which an individual makes a moral judgment based on ethical principles. The seven steps of moral reasoning, also known as the seven-step ethical decision-making process, are a systematic approach to resolving ethical dilemmas. Let's apply these steps to analyze a star employee's actions:</p><p></p><p>Step 1: Gather the facts - Gather all the facts about the situation involving the star employee. What did the employee do that needs analysis?</p><p></p><p>Step 2: Define the ethical issues - Identify the ethical issues or dilemmas in the star employee's actions. What ethical principles are at stake here?</p><p></p><p>Step 3: Identify the stakeholders - Identify all the stakeholders who are affected by the star employee's actions. Who are the individuals or groups who have a stake in this situation?</p><p></p><p>Step 4: Consider the available alternatives - Generate a list of possible solutions to the problem. What are the different options for addressing the situation involving the star employee?</p><p></p><p>Step 5: Compare and weigh the alternatives - Evaluate each of the alternatives in terms of how well they address the ethical issues and the interests of the stakeholders. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each option?</p><p></p><p>Step 6: Make a decision - Select the best course of action based on the ethical principles and the interests of the stakeholders. What is the most ethical and appropriate action to take in this situation?</p><p></p><p>Step 7: Monitor and modify - Implement the decision and monitor its effects. Evaluate whether the decision resolved the ethical dilemma and whether it had any unintended consequences. If necessary, modify the decision to achieve the desired outcomes.</p><p></p><p>By applying these seven steps of moral reasoning, we can analyze the star employee's actions from an ethical perspective and determine the most appropriate course of action to take.</p><br />

It must be realized that one common element to moral dilemmas is that there are no easy and painless solutions to them. Normally, the decision that is made is one that possesses the least number of problems or negative consequences, not one that is devoid of them.ental than others.<br />

                            8. Read and reflect to our discussion about the 7-steps on Moral Reasoning Model then justify your answer. From  the book of Deuteronomy 30:15-18 (15 Points) 15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; 16  In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. 17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The 7-steps on Moral Reasoning Model provide a framework for making ethical decisions by considering the consequences of our actions and the principles that guide them. In the context of Deuteronomy 30:15-18, the passage emphasizes the importance of following God's commandments and the consequences of turning away from them.</p><p></p><p>Using the Moral Reasoning Model, we can analyze the passage as follows:</p><p></p><p>Identify the problem: The problem is whether to follow God's commandments or turn away from them.</p><p></p><p>Gather information: The passage provides information about the consequences of following or turning away from God's commandments.</p><p></p><p>Identify the stakeholders: The stakeholders are the individual who must make the decision and the community affected by their decision.</p><p></p><p>Consider values and principles: The values and principles involved are obedience to God's commandments and the consequences of turning away from them.</p><p></p><p>Explore options: The options are to follow God's commandments or turn away from them.</p><p></p><p>Act: The individual must make a decision and act on it by either following God's commandments or turning away from them.</p><p></p><p>Reflect on the decision: The individual must reflect on the decision and its consequences, both for themselves and for their community.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, the passage emphasizes the importance of following God's commandments and the consequences of turning away from them. The passage suggests that following God's commandments will lead to blessings and a prolonged life, while turning away from them will lead to perishing and a shortened life. The passage also implies that the decision to follow or turn away from God's commandments has consequences not only for the individual but also for their community.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the 7-steps on Moral Reasoning Model can be applied to the passage from Deuteronomy 30:15-18 by analyzing the problem, gathering information, identifying stakeholders, considering values and principles, exploring options, acting, and reflecting on the decision. The passage emphasizes the importance of following God's commandments and the consequences of turning away from them, highlighting the ethical principles of obedience and responsibility.</p><br />

                            9. Answer the case situation using the 7-step moral reasoning model. Kate is a 17 years old patient, unmarried and 8 weeks pregnant. She is a rather remarkable girl in that she lives independently while still a senior in a high school. She tells you that she was an adoptee given back to foster care, and then abused in that system. She is now an emancipated minor who works 30 hours per week at a service industry job while also earning a 4.0 GPA in school, ranking in the top 10% of her class. She is college-bound, with a full-ride scholarship for pre-med undergraduate studies at a prestigious university. Kate has absolutely no family support, and the former boyfriend who is the father of her unborn child/fetus simply disappeared upon learning of the pregnancy. Your patient is scared, uninsured, and says she doesn’t want to be pregnant or a mom (“Perhaps someday, but not now!”). She rejects the adoption option, based on her own experience growing up, and requests abortion only, at this hospital where she has always received medical care.” Your faith-based health care system rejects elective abortion option. What ought to be done for Kate? And by whom? 3.Review relevant ethical guidelines. ? 4. Obtain consultation. (additional info) ? 6. Compare the alternative with the principles?​</h2><br />
