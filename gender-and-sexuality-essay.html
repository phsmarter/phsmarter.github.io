                                            Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

These groups that only advocate for offer abstinence programs that instill shame and fear to discourage teenagers from engaging in sexual activities; they do not offer information regarding how teenagers can protect themselves from diseases and pregnancies. Arguments against Sexuality Opponents of sexuality suggest that sexuality education causes sexual experimentation because the educators do not have the required skills to handle the issue. Some sexuality programs are also considered to begin too early in life when kids cannot understand the issues, and it makes the opponents feel that parents should be the right people to handle sex education for their children. To some extent, the education of sexuality gets viewed as too controversial to get handled by schools and institutions.</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity​</strong></p><p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are two crucial aspects of a person's identity that have been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. While some argue that individuals should have the right to express themselves and love who they choose, others argue that certain sexual orientations and gender identities are unnatural or immoral. However, it is important to recognize that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, sexual orientation is a natural and normal part of human diversity. People can have different sexual orientations, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual. It is not a choice but rather an inherent characteristic of an individual's identity. People cannot control who they are attracted to, and it is not something that can be changed or "cured" through therapy or other methods. Therefore, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of sexual orientations.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, gender identity is also an inherent part of a person's identity. Gender identity refers to an individual's sense of their own gender, which can be male, female, or non-binary. Like sexual orientation, gender identity is not a choice but rather a part of who a person is. It is important to recognize and respect the gender identity of individuals, regardless of whether it aligns with their biological sex.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ often face discrimination and marginalization in society. This discrimination can manifest in many ways, including harassment, violence, and unequal treatment in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare. This discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, and can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>In addition to discrimination, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ also face legal barriers that limit their rights and freedoms. For example, in many countries, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and LGBTQ+ individuals are denied the right to adopt children or access fertility treatments. These legal barriers can further contribute to the marginalization and discrimination of LGBTQ+ individuals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected. Discrimination and marginalization of individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity are not only unfair but also harmful. It is important for society to recognize the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting world for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p></p><br />

                            17. Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />

                        <p>Gender identity refers to an individual's internal sense of themselves as male, female, or non-binary. It is different from biological sex, which is determined by one's physical characteristics, such as chromosomes, hormones, and genitalia. Gender identity is a deeply personal and subjective experience, and it can vary from person to person.</p><p></p><p>For most people, their gender identity matches their biological sex, and they identify as either male or female. However, for some individuals, their gender identity does not align with their biological sex. This is known as gender dysphoria or transgender identity. Transgender individuals may experience discomfort or distress because their gender identity is not recognized or supported by society.</p><p></p><p>Non-binary individuals, on the other hand, do not identify as exclusively male or female. They may identify as both, neither, or a combination of both. Non-binary individuals may use gender-neutral pronouns, such as they/them, or other gender-neutral language.</p><p></p><p>Gender identity is an important aspect of one's identity and can have a significant impact on a person's mental health and well-being. Discrimination and lack of understanding about gender identity can lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. Transgender individuals may also face barriers to accessing healthcare, housing, and employment, which can exacerbate these negative effects.</p><p></p><p>It is important to understand and respect the diversity of gender identity and to support individuals in their self-expression and identity. This can include using preferred pronouns, creating gender-neutral spaces, and advocating for policies and laws that protect the rights of transgender and non-binary individuals.</p><p></p><p>Gender identity is a complex and nuanced concept that requires open-mindedness, empathy, and understanding. By creating a more inclusive and accepting society, we can help support the well-being and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.</p><p></p><br />
