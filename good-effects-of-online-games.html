Growing vegestables is more important than growing flowering plants because vegetable is health and can be eaten while flowering plants only serve as a decoration.</p><p>3. Humans are responsible for the extinction or disappearance of animals because mostly of the factors that can cause extinction of animals are the effects of what humans are doing like the illegal logging that can cause deforestation and habitat loss for animals that lives in the forests.</p><p>4. Watching television programs bring about good effects like being able to be updated about the latest news about out government, weather and other important factors. Some of the shows also teaches children important lessons which they can carry on when they grow up.</p><p>5.
