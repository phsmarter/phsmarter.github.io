Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences.

What I am talking about here is my first hike in the mountains. ___2.Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and more compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future.___3. Though cell phones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating, distracting students by the possibility to access the internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cell phones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon as cyberbullying. ___4. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska. America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old. George and Terry, my two best friends and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.___5. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 ( Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses.

The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12.

                                             Rearrange the following paragraphs by labeling 1-5 to build a strong body of persuasive essay.______a) The main reason which may win most of people's support is that if lack the reading and writing ability, one would be considered as illiterate who has been deprived of the most basic right of human beings in the 21st century. ______b) The second reason I would like to point out is that people today who cannot read and write cannot even make a living. Good jobs are difficult to find because of economic depression.______c) It will be hard for us to imagine how somebody who can't read and write communicates with other people. A case in point is that one of my neighbors who is an old man and cannot read and write may only talk with others face to face. As for making friends by email and search information in newspaper, it is absolutely impossible. ______d) Furthermore, the ability to read and write could bring us lots of advantages. Suppose that people who have tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort may get lots of benefits and relief from reading a short novel and broaden his horizon by appreciating a nice poem. Many friends around me would believe reading and writing some effective ways to relax themselves.______e) Nearly all the jobs require people who can read and write very well. Even if one just plans to be a driver, he must read the road sign and know where he is and where he will go.​</a>

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)
_____14. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you'll get it
B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations
C. Effective leaders encourage a high level of performance by expecting the best from their employees
D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.
_____15. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. In 1902, Roosevelt went to Mississippi and was the guest of honor at a hunting expedition
B. The name “Teddy Bear” is derived from President Theodore Roosevelt
C. After story got publicity via political cartoons, candy store owner created Teddy's bear
D. The bear was a hit, and everyone wanted one</a>

                            1. Essay:Me as part of my community and my community as part of my life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all know full well that being a member of a community is vital to</p><p>             the success of our world. Communities are an essential part of human</p><p>             existence that impact our world view. The purpose of this discussion is to</p><p>             examine what it means to be a part of a community. We will focus on the</p><p>             concepts of volunteerism and safety in the community.</p><p>             What it means to be part of a community</p><p>             The community in which I live is rather small and urban. There are a</p><p>             total of nine schools in the area and the population is rather diverse. As</p><p>             a member of a diverse community, I have the ability and responsibility to</p><p>             educate myself about the different cultures and religions that exist within</p><p>             the community. Through this education, I can discover how to better serve</p><p>             the needs of my neighborsâ€"this is what it means to be a part of a</p><p>             As a member of the community I also must understand the essentiality</p><p>             of volunteerism. Volunteerism allows me to take the focus off of myself</p><p>             and devote my time and energy to others that are in need. I currently</p><p>             volunteer my time at my church and to coaching recreational youth</p><p>             activities.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained.

                            13.  Rearrange the following paragraphs by labeling 1-5 to build a strong body of persuasive essay.______a) The main reason which may win most of people's support is that if lack the reading and writing ability, one would be considered as illiterate who has been deprived of the most basic right of human beings in the 21st century. ______b) The second reason I would like to point out is that people today who cannot read and write cannot even make a living. Good jobs are difficult to find because of economic depression.______c) It will be hard for us to imagine how somebody who can't read and write communicates with other people. A case in point is that one of my neighbors who is an old man and cannot read and write may only talk with others face to face. As for making friends by email and search information in newspaper, it is absolutely impossible. ______d) Furthermore, the ability to read and write could bring us lots of advantages. Suppose that people who have tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort may get lots of benefits and relief from reading a short novel and broaden his horizon by appreciating a nice poem. Many friends around me would believe reading and writing some effective ways to relax themselves.______e) Nearly all the jobs require people who can read and write very well. Even if one just plans to be a driver, he must read the road sign and know where he is and where he will go.​</h2><br />

______11. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains.
______12. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future.
______13. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying.
______14. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN Security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001). Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorist activities are not always favorable.

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.
_____15. What is the main idea of this passage?
