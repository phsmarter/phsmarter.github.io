                                            1. Operating costs - These include expenses like salaries of employees, rentals, insurance, light and water payments. Operating costs are also called overhead costs. These are expenses that are needed before a business can run 2. Selling costs - These include expenses like delivery charges, transportation expenses, mail and others. 3. Owner's profits - The owner must receive a profit from his business for personal use. This is a reward or payment for his efforts to keep the business going. These expenses must be computed or estimated and added to the cost of goods for sale to determine their selling price. This is called the mark-on or gross profit. Mark On = Selling Price - Cost For example, if Carlo decides to sell for P100 each the T-shirts he bought for P75 how much will be the mark-on or profit? Selling Price = P100 Cost of Goods for Sale/Sold = P75 Mark On = Selling Price - Cost P100-P75 = P25 Carlo has a mark-on or gross profit of P25 for every t-shirt sold Will the whole P25 go to him as his personal profit. No. Remember that there are three basic expenses that must be considered. The selling cost, operational cost and owner's profit. Only after he has alloted an amount to cover the selling and operational costs can he take whatever's left as owner's profit.​</a>

What statements of positive economics are used to support requiring airbags? What normative reasoning is used?_______________________________Should the Government Require Air Bags?Technological advances continously provide new high-tech options to Save lives that add to the price of cars, such as cameras, radar, and airbags. Airbag advocates say airbags will save lives and government should require them in all cars. Airbags add an estimated $600 to the cost of a car, compared to about $100 For a set of the regular seat belts. Opponents argue that airbags are electronic devices subject to Failure and have produced injuries and death. For example, airbags have killed both adults and children whose heads were within the inflation zone at the time of deployment. Opponents therefore believe the government should leave the decision of whether to spend an extra $600 or so far an airbag to the consumer The role of the government should be limited to providing in formation on the risks of having versus not having airbags.​</a>

The business will initially focus on producing piglets for sale to other farmers, with plans to expand into pork production in the future.</p><p></p><p>Technical Analysis:</p><p>The technical feasibility of the project will be assessed by evaluating the availability of land, facilities, and equipment needed for the swine production operations. This will include assessing the availability of suitable breeding stock, housing and feeding equipment, and veterinary services. The technical analysis will also evaluate the environmental impact of the project and determine the best practices for waste management and biosecurity.</p><p></p><p>Market Analysis:</p><p>The market analysis will assess the demand for piglets and pork products in the local and regional markets. This will include analyzing the current and future trends in the swine industry, the size and growth rate of the market, and the competition. The market analysis will also identify potential customers, such as other farmers and meat processing companies.</p><p></p><p>Financial Analysis:</p><p>The financial analysis will evaluate the feasibility of the project by estimating the start-up costs, operating expenses, and projected revenues. This will include analyzing the costs of land, facilities, equipment, labor, and feed. The financial analysis will also project the expected revenue from the sale of piglets and pork products, and evaluate the profitability and return on investment of the project.</p><p></p><p>Legal Analysis:</p><p>The legal analysis will review the legal and regulatory requirements for setting up and operating a swine production business. This will include obtaining necessary permits and licenses, complying with animal welfare and environmental regulations, and meeting food safety and labeling requirements.</p><p></p><p>Risk Assessment:</p><p>The risk assessment will identify and assess the potential risks and challenges that may impact the success of the project. This will include identifying potential diseases that may affect the swine herd, assessing the impact of natural disasters, and evaluating the potential for market volatility. The risk assessment will also identify strategies for mitigating these risks, such as implementing biosecurity measures and diversifying the product line.</p><p></p><p>Overall, conducting a feasibility study for a swine production business will help assess the viability of the project and identify potential risks and challenges. The study will provide a roadmap for the project's development and help ensure its success.</p><br />

                            19. 1. Operating costs - These include expenses like salaries of employees, rentals, insurance, light and water payments. Operating costs are also called overhead costs. These are expenses that are needed before a business can run 2. Selling costs - These include expenses like delivery charges, transportation expenses, mail and others. 3. Owner's profits - The owner must receive a profit from his business for personal use. This is a reward or payment for his efforts to keep the business going. These expenses must be computed or estimated and added to the cost of goods for sale to determine their selling price. This is called the mark-on or gross profit. Mark On = Selling Price - Cost For example, if Carlo decides to sell for P100 each the T-shirts he bought for P75 how much will be the mark-on or profit? Selling Price = P100 Cost of Goods for Sale/Sold = P75 Mark On = Selling Price - Cost P100-P75 = P25 Carlo has a mark-on or gross profit of P25 for every t-shirt sold Will the whole P25 go to him as his personal profit. No. Remember that there are three basic expenses that must be considered. The selling cost, operational cost and owner's profit. Only after he has alloted an amount to cover the selling and operational costs can he take whatever's left as owner's profit.​</h2><br />

Airbag advocates say airbags will save lives and government should require them in all cars. Airbags add an estimated $600 to the cost of a car, compared to about $100 For a set of the regular seat belts. Opponents argue that airbags are electronic devices subject to Failure and have produced injuries and death. For example, airbags have killed both adults and children whose heads were within the inflation zone at the time of deployment. Opponents therefore believe the government should leave the decision of whether to spend an extra $600 or so far an airbag to the consumer The role of the government should be limited to providing in formation on the risks of having versus not having airbags.​</h2><br />
