There are so many new things I have experienced which is until now is quite unusual. Nevertheless,  I’ve realize that I became closer to my parents during our Home school/study.<br /><br />However, I appreciate the effort and the patience that My Teachers has given to us. Teaching thru online is very challenging also to them because they cannot control the students while online.<br />I salute their passion to serve and guide us to every lesson we need to tackle.<br />These are my Learning at Home during Lockdown.<br /><br />- CLI CKA NDS HOP PE <br />KAR MA XG AD GE TS<br />Sundan nyo ako dito<br />Salamat mga anak<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"My Home, My Sanctuary: A Reflection of My Identity and Personality"</p><p></p><p>My home is not just a place where I live, it is a physical manifestation of my identity, the sum of my experiences, tastes, and preferences. It is the place I can truly call my own, my sanctuary from the outside world. Each element of my home reflects and speaks to my unique personality and character, and it is through my home that I express myself to the world. It is a place where I can be myself, without judgment or fear, and where I can create and curate the environment I desire, without external influences. My home is my safe haven, where I can relax, recharge, and heal from the demands and stresses of life. It is a place where I can escape to when the outside world becomes too overwhelming, and where I can find the comfort and security I need to recharge and face the challenges that await me outside my door. My home is my sanctuary, a place that reflects and celebrates who I am as a person, and I am grateful for the warmth and comfort it provides.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During this time, it can be easy to forget about the planet, and this Earth Day is a great time to remind ourselves of the importance of protecting the environment. There are many things that we can do on an individual, local, statewide, national, and worldwide scale to try to protect this planet.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest things you can try is writing to government representatives who have the power to set laws and regulations regarding the health of our planet. If enough people show that they care, they will listen. They can help with the larger issues such as deforestation, emissions, and the types of energy we use. This will definitely help, but perhaps the most important thing we can do is to be smart consumers and take a few minutes out of our busy lives to consider the environmental impact of the products we are buying. When enough people ask for something, our voices can be heard and we can use them to inspire change in the cycle of consumerism.</p><p></p><p>If we are to preserve this planet that we all live on, we cannot simply wait for others to solve our problems for us. We must take an active stand and show the world that we care. It is our individual and collective responsibility as a worldwide society to care for this planet on which we all live and depend.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I had a lot of experiences while being quarantined/in quarantine, but to be brief and precise. I began to notice how my mind and imagination widened as months passed, I realized a lot of things and it eventually helped me to be better as a person (although I'm still in the process). Though there were days where I'd cry and regret a lot of things, but what's done is done, anyway, I also experienced how to be patient and understanding in so many ways. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope it helps, it's also nice that you're out here asking for experiences instead of copy pasting something on websites that the teachers know and will eventually tell you you're being a plagiarist.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Stress is an unavoidable part of life. Whether it’s from school, work, family, or the community, stress can be overwhelming and hard to manage. I have experienced stress in all of these areas and have developed strategies to help me cope with it. </p><p></p><p>At home, I often feel overwhelmed by the demands of my family. My parents expect me to do well in school and help out around the house. This can be a lot to handle at times. To manage this stress, I try to stay organized and make lists of tasks that need to be done each day. This helps me stay on top of things and not get overwhelmed by all that needs to be done. I also take time for myself each day to relax and unwind so that I don’t become too stressed out. </p><p></p><p>In school, stress can come from a variety of sources such as exams, assignments, and deadlines. To manage this stress, I make sure that I am organized and plan ahead for upcoming tests or assignments. I also try to break down large tasks into smaller ones so that they are more manageable. Additionally, I make sure that I get enough sleep each night so that my mind is clear and focused when studying or taking exams. </p><p></p><p>In the community, stress can come from a variety of sources such as work or volunteer commitments or social obligations. To manage this stress, I try to prioritize my commitments so that I am not overburdened with too many tasks at once. Additionally, if something becomes too overwhelming for me then I will ask for help from friends or family members who may be able to lend a hand in completing the task at hand. </p><p></p><p>Overall, managing stress is an important part of life as it can have serious consequences if left unchecked. By staying organized and planning ahead for upcoming tasks or commitments, as well as taking time for myself each day to relax and unwind, I am able to better manage my stress levels in all areas of my life – home, school, and community alike!</p><p></p><p>_*Hera</p><p>hope it helps po</p><br />
