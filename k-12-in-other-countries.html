                    <p>K to 12 is a kind of educational foundation where you can hone your talents and skills. It provides additional knowledge to students who have graduated from junior high school. K to 12 education,preparing children for adult responsibilities, these will be a preparation when we are able to take a course in college.Others who have graduated k to 12 can get a job, such as others who do not have enough money to take the desired course in college, so others prefer to study up to k to 12 only.Critics say that its implementation could only worsen the issue on education in the country. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (Reyes, 2015). Though some people cannot see its relevance, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.The students are more concerned about this, they are having a hard time going to junior high school because of the lack of money, it is even more difficult for the student to choose a strand because of the thought of whether they will have more difficulty here Or not? extended they are still studying instead of graduating and can find a good job. K to 12 is one of the most important aspects implemented in education, because it is not only here that the talent and talent of a student can be honed but also that you manage properly how to do it.pa summarize naman po nito plss kaylangan lang​</p>

                                            Let's reform the K-12 program Filipino students face a serious gap in leaming as a result of the world's longest community lockdown that put them out of physical classrooms for nearly two years. What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmed Waste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education. The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, had the longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered, breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020. Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce. And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parents scrambling for resources to sustain their children's education. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program. The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation. What now with K-12? Like-minded educators are proposing that K-12 be optional, especially for industries that can accommodate short-course holders. Processing Questions: 1. What is the news all about? 2. What is your reaction about the news? 3. Do you agree or disagree with what the news stated?​</a>

According to the data of the "2018 Fresh Graduate Report," the state-run university bested the four other big universities in the country, Radyo Inquirer 990 AM reported on Wednesday. In 2016 report, Jobstreet also found that graduates from PUP are the top choice of various employers. Following PUP were the University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University University of Santo Tomas, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, and Far Eastern Both the De La Salle University and Technological Institute of the Philippines landed at the seventh spot The University of San Carlos, University of Cebu, and the University of the East were also part of the top 10. Jobstreet report said the employers are highly considering the qualities of the fresh graduates, particularly their willingness to learn, personal grooming, and ability to work with others The company added that 24 percent of employers coming from the BPO industry, manufacturing professional services, retail, and machinery and equipment said that they were already willing to hire graduates from the K-12 programs, report showed. Meanwhile, 25 percent of employers said that they were still not yet ready to hire K-12 graduates.​</a>

                                            Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</a>

                            1. K to 12 is a kind of educational foundation where you can hone your talents and skills. It provides additional knowledge to students who have graduated from junior high school. K to 12 education,preparing children for adult responsibilities, these will be a preparation when we are able to take a course in college.Others who have graduated k to 12 can get a job, such as others who do not have enough money to take the desired course in college, so others prefer to study up to k to 12 only.Critics say that its implementation could only worsen the issue on education in the country. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (Reyes, 2015). Though some people cannot see its relevance, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.The students are more concerned about this, they are having a hard time going to junior high school because of the lack of money, it is even more difficult for the student to choose a strand because of the thought of whether they will have more difficulty here Or not? extended they are still studying instead of graduating and can find a good job. K to 12 is one of the most important aspects implemented in education, because it is not only here that the talent and talent of a student can be honed but also that you manage properly how to do it.pa summarize naman po nito plss kaylangan lang​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>K to 12 is an educational program that provides additional knowledge and skills to students who have completed junior high school. It prepares them for adult responsibilities and further education or job opportunities. Critics believe that the program worsens educational issues due to inadequate resources. However, K to 12 provides better education quality, job opportunities, and prepares the country for ASEAN integration. Students face challenges, such as financial constraints and difficulty choosing a strand, but K to 12 helps in managing and honing their talents.</p><br />

                            2. Let's reform the K-12 program Filipino students face a serious gap in leaming as a result of the world's longest community lockdown that put them out of physical classrooms for nearly two years. What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmed Waste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education. The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, had the longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered, breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020. Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce. And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parents scrambling for resources to sustain their children's education. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program. The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation.

                            8. 2. article: pup grads are employers' top pick for new hires by: Faye Orellana Graduates from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) emerged anew as the top choice of employers when it comes to hiring fresh graduates, a latest report by Jobstreet Philippines showed. According to the data of the "2018 Fresh Graduate Report," the state-run university bested the four other big universities in the country, Radyo Inquirer 990 AM reported on Wednesday. In 2016 report, Jobstreet also found that graduates from PUP are the top choice of various employers. Following PUP were the University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University University of Santo Tomas, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, and Far Eastern Both the De La Salle University and Technological Institute of the Philippines landed at the seventh spot The University of San Carlos, University of Cebu, and the University of the East were also part of the top 10. Jobstreet report said the employers are highly considering the qualities of the fresh graduates, particularly their willingness to learn, personal grooming, and ability to work with others The company added that 24 percent of employers coming from the BPO industry, manufacturing professional services, retail, and machinery and equipment said that they were already willing to hire graduates from the K-12 programs, report showed. Meanwhile, 25 percent of employers said that they were still not yet ready to hire K-12 graduates.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Critique Paper Reaction </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Reported By Faye Orellana , PUP or Polytechnic university of the Philippines is top pick for new hires by the employers by 2018 , they are highly considering the qualities of the fresh graduates,particularly their willingness to learn, personal grooming and ability to work others.  As the employer,  it is very important to know and to be sure who they are going to hire so they will know that they will grow with them and guide them to be the best they are and be the asset to the company so it is understadable to have the high standard and choose from the best. But when we look on the other side they should be considering to look on the applicants ability to work under-pressure and not only the qualifications because today there are thousands of applicants who did not graduate or yet have the opportunity to study and graduate from the best university out there. Them having to be hard working and goal achiever is the ability they should be looking. </p><br />

                            10. Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</h2><br />
