Through the years the common belief has beenthat women could not perform as well as men in anything, but over the years that belief hasbeen proven wrong time and time again. So as time marches on, women have clawed andfought their way up the ladder to gain much needed equal respect from the opposite sexHowever, after many years of pain and suffering, the battle for equal rights has not yet beenwon. Since women have fought for a long time and proven their importance in society, theydeserve the same rights as men."1. What is the THESIS STATEMENT in this introductory paragraph?2.

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

Parents spend sleepless nights thinking of children’s welfare during their entire life, even when they have grown into adults. </p><p>When we were young and helpless, parents have always been protective, comforting and caring, besides, loving unconditionally. Parents are at all times ready to forgive our misconduct. There is no basis for children to disrespect their parents because respecting them is the only way of showing gratitude.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>1. What is a Critique?</strong><p><strong>Critique</strong> is a method of disciplined, systematic study of a written or oral discourse. Although critique is commonly understood as fault finding and negative judgment, it can also involve merit recognition, and in the philosophical tradition it also means a methodical practice of doubt. The contemporary sense of critique has been largely influenced by the Enlightenment critique of prejudice and authority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and political authorities.  </p><strong>2. What are the steps in writing a Critique?</strong><p><strong>Steps in Writing a Critique:</strong></p>Describe: give the reader a sense of the writer's overall purpose and intent.
Analyze: examine how the structure and language of the text convey its meaning.
Interpret: state the significance or importance of each part of the text.
Assess: make a judgment of the work's worth or value.<strong>3. Why is it important to develop the skills in Critiquing?</strong><p>Critique groups are important but they can be a waste of time or damaging to your self-esteem/writing if the people in the group don’t know how to provide critique and you don’t know how to receive critique. </p><p>Here are some skills I had to learn over the years about giving and receiving critique:  </p><strong>When giving critique, break it down into “What Works,” “What Needs Work,” and “Overall Summary” of your critique.</strong> This way you give equal importance to the things that you like about the piece and the things that you think could be improved.
<strong>When giving critique, talk to the person by beginning your thoughts with “what I really like about this essay is...but I feel that if you tried …. it would make things more clear/interesting/funny/etc.”</strong> This way you are always beginning with something positive and the person being critiqued doesn’t feel like you are attacking them and gets defensive.
<strong>When giving critique, be as open-minded as possible.</strong> When offering your perspective on things, try to see it from the writer’s perspective as well so that they know you are taking the time to understand what they are trying to do. This is especially important for memoir because the topics can be very personal to the writer.
<strong>When giving critique be honest.</strong> Don’t lie to the person because you feel bad for them or are too scared to hurt their feelings. You will not help them become better writers by lying to them. On the other hand, there are ways to be honest without hurting people’s feelings. Learn them.
<strong>When giving critique, be honest but don’t be judgement.</strong> There is a difference. Keep your personal opinions to yourself unless you are offering them in a positive/constructive way to help them grow as writers. This is especially true for memoir because people are baring all the intimate details of their lives to you. Do not judge them by how they have lived their lives.
<strong>When receiving critique, remember, this is not a critique of you as a person, it just a critique of your writing.</strong> Don’t take everything personally. Your critique group members are trying to help you get better at writing.
<strong>When receiving critique, don’t be defensive.</strong> One of the techniques we practiced on critique days in my classes was that the person being critiqued is not allowed to say anything while they are being critiqued. Once everyone in the group is done offering their critique, they have the chance to clarify and explain themselves.
<strong>When receiving critique, know which critiques to keep and which to let go of.</strong> After you have quietly listened to everyone’s critique and taken notes, let the ideas float in your head for a few hours or a day or two before you actually begin revising the essay. When you have had time to mull over things, you might find that some critiques were more helpful than others so you keep some and drop the rest.
<strong>When receiving critique, always take notes.</strong> I know this sounds obvious but I have seen so many people not take notes during critiques. There is no way you are going to remember everything everyone said. Also, when you write things down, you can go back to them later with a cool head and find inspiration in them.
<strong>When receiving critique, make sure your critique group is a positive learning environment.</strong> It is difficult to find critique groups where you get the perfect balance of constructive criticism and encouragement. Make the effort to find such a group. You don’t want a group where everyone is too nice and afraid of hurting your feelings because that won’t help you become a better writer.  <p>These are skills I developed over the years after a lot of practice and they have made me a better critique group member and a better writer/editor. I hope you found this information helpful.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Many people do not understand the importance of physical fitness and maintaining good health, therefore they ignore physical fitness and activities which then could lead to life threatening conditions such as heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and many more. By enduring daily physical activities, you are not only improving the state and condition of your body, but your state of mind as well. This can benefit your mental state of mind by improving your confidence, and make you feel overall better about yourself and your looks. There are four primary components of fitness, cardio-respiratory capacity, muscular capacity, flexibility, and body composition. Cardio-respiratory capacity allows the body to take in oxygen and </strong><strong>supply.</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Flexibility is crucially important to the human body, increased flexibility allows more blood to flow to your muscles, decreased risk of an injury, and overall improves your posture. Body composition is the overall percentage of the fat, muscle, mass, water, and tissue composition of our bodies, daily physical fitness can overtime lower your body fat percentage, making your body more lean, and overall increase size and overall muscle. Benefits of maintaining a healthy body composition are better sleep, normal blood pressure, reduced pain in the joints, and back, and improves your overall BMI.</strong></p><br />

                            18. What does respect have to do with you and with others?Find out more by reading the two excerpts. Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.
