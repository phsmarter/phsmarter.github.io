                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Source:http://www.uwlux.edu/uploaded Files/Academics/Departments/Political_Science_and_Public_Admin/journal_article_critique_example.pdfType of Document:Purpose of the:Review:Writer’s Persona:Intended Reader:Strengths:Weaknesses:​</a>

                                            Learning Task 3Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.
Can you infer where I am?</a>

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.
This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.
Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal.
It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts.
The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.
In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.
There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.

                                            Activity 2: Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of DocumentPurpose of the ReviewWriter’s PersonaIntended ReaderStrengthsWeaknesses​</a>

                                            Read the speech of the former president Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table. Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do - grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility - we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow-education, infrastructure, research - we should cut what we don't need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs. This shouldn't be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking-not growing. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.

But we shouldn’t hold back on placeswhere we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t likecompromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’tgovern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s justhurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come fromdifferent parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans,to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.

                                            Learning Task 3
Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.
Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was
reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a
time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually
harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been
higher.
The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we
need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the
middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.
It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and
Republicans can work together right away.
First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster
and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So
we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay
better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we
should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult
as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.
Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America
that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would
secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The
majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.
Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable
children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term
certainty they deserve.
We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places
where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like
compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t
govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just
hurting the people we were sent here to serve.
Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from
different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans,
to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.
Thanks everybody and have a great weekend

                                            Directions: Read the passage below. Then, complete the table by identifying the general and specific statements.  The important thing in education is the development of the human mind. Education is meant to enable the mind to create and produce new formula, new inventions and new tools. True education  makes the mind look for solutions to new problems whose solutions perhaps are not in the books. It is meant to develop individuals who can produce advanced and new knowledge, who can follow new ways of thinking and introduce new thoughts of their own, who can read on for themselves and learn alone when they are no longer in the school university, and whose mind does not stop thinking when it is faced with new challenges. Such individuals will be the products of true institutions of learnings, they are the real wealth of the nation. -Source: http://study.com/academy/lesson General Statementsplease help me​</a>

                                            Activity 2: Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strongmethodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced. Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only-begotten ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due tologistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size. In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it. There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of Document:_____Purpose of the Review:_______Writer’s Persona:_____Intended Reader:_____Strengths:_____Weaknesses:______​</a>

It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Source:http://www.uwlux.edu/uploaded Files/Academics/Departments/Political_Science_and_Public_Admin/journal_article_critique_example.pdfType of Document:Purpose of the:Review:Writer’s Persona:Intended Reader:Strengths:Weaknesses:​</h2><br />

                            10. Learning Task 3Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.

                            14. Learning Task 2: Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table. Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility - we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow - education, infrastructure, research - we should cut what we don't need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs. This shouldn't be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking - not growing. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don't think it's good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don't like compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn't governing - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we're Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love. Thanks everybody and have a great weekend. Point/Claim Evidences Type of Evidence​</h2><br />

                            16. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.
This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.
Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal.
It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts.
The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.
In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.
There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.

                            26. Learning Task 3
Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.
Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was
reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a
time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually
harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been
higher.
The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we
need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the
middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.
It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and
Republicans can work together right away.
First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster
and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So
we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay
better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we
should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult
as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.
Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America
that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would
secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The
majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.
Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable
children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term
certainty they deserve.
We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places
where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like
compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t
govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just
hurting the people we were sent here to serve.
Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from
different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans,
to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.
Thanks everybody and have a great weekend

The important thing in education is the development of the human mind. Education is meant to enable the mind to create and produce new formula, new inventions and new tools. True education  makes the mind look for solutions to new problems whose solutions perhaps are not in the books. It is meant to develop individuals who can produce advanced and new knowledge, who can follow new ways of thinking and introduce new thoughts of their own, who can read on for themselves and learn alone when they are no longer in the school university, and whose mind does not stop thinking when it is faced with new challenges. Such individuals will be the products of true institutions of learnings, they are the real wealth of the nation. -Source: http://study.com/academy/lesson General Statementsplease help me​</h2><br />

                            29. Activity 2: Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strongmethodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced. Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only-begotten ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due tologistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size. In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it. There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of Document:_____Purpose of the Review:_______Writer’s Persona:_____Intended Reader:_____Strengths:_____Weaknesses:______​</h2><br />
