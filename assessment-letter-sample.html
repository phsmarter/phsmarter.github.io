                                            AssessmentAnswer the following questions by writing the letter of the correct answer from thechoices below.1. Which of the following does NOT illustrate the Central Limit Theorem?A. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate the distribution of thesample means over the population means.B. If the sample size n, where n is sufficiently large is drawn from any populationwith mean i and a standard deviation o, then the sampling distribution ofsample means approximates the normal distribution.C. Whenever the population is not normally distributed, or if we do not know ofits distribution, the Central Limit Theorem allows us to conclude that thedistribution of sample means will be normal if the sample size is sufficientlylarge.D. Given a random variable X with mean y and variance o?, then regardless ofwhether the population distribution of X is normally distributed or not, theshape of the distribution of the sample means taken from the populationapproaches a normal distribution.2. The Central Limit Theorem states that:A. the sample size is large.B. all possible samples are selected.C. the standard error of the sampling distribution is small.D. the standard deviation is sufficiently large than the normal.3. The Central Limit Theorem states that the mean of the sampling distribution ofthe sample mean isA. larger than the population mean.B. exactly equal to the population mean.C. equal to the population mean divided by the square root of the sample size.D. close to the population means if the sample size is large.4. Which of the following descriptions about Central Limit Theorem is NOT essential?A. The larger the sample, the better approximation will be.B. The smaller the sample, the bigger the approximation will be.C. When the original variable is normally distributed, the distribution of thesample means will be normally distributed for any sample size n.D. When the distribution of the original variable might not be normal, a samplesize of 30 or more is needed to use a normal distribution to approximate thedistribution of the sample means.5. Suppose the average age of family members is 34 with a standard deviation of 4.If 100 members of the community decided to have a summer outing bonding andrelaxation, find the probability that the average of these members is less than 35?A. 91.32%C. 95%B. 94.45%D. 99.38%​</a>

Which of the following does NOT illustrate the Central Limit Theorem?A. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate the distribution of thesample means over the population means.B. If the sample size n, where n is sufficiently large is drawn from any populationwith mean i and a standard deviation o, then the sampling distribution ofsample means approximates the normal distribution.C. Whenever the population is not normally distributed, or if we do not know ofits distribution, the Central Limit Theorem allows us to conclude that thedistribution of sample means will be normal if the sample size is sufficientlylarge.D. Given a random variable X with mean y and variance o?, then regardless ofwhether the population distribution of X is normally distributed or not, theshape of the distribution of the sample means taken from the populationapproaches a normal distribution.2. The Central Limit Theorem states that:A. the sample size is large.B. all possible samples are selected.C. the standard error of the sampling distribution is small.D. the standard deviation is sufficiently large than the normal.3. The Central Limit Theorem states that the mean of the sampling distribution ofthe sample mean isA. larger than the population mean.B. exactly equal to the population mean.C. equal to the population mean divided by the square root of the sample size.D. close to the population means if the sample size is large.4. Which of the following descriptions about Central Limit Theorem is NOT essential?A. The larger the sample, the better approximation will be.B. The smaller the sample, the bigger the approximation will be.C. When the original variable is normally distributed, the distribution of thesample means will be normally distributed for any sample size n.D. When the distribution of the original variable might not be normal, a samplesize of 30 or more is needed to use a normal distribution to approximate thedistribution of the sample means.5.

They have 500 years political history, so far the longest political experience compared to other groups in the whole Philippines. Their culture is a blend of Islam and adat. Adat is the sum of both pre-Islamic culture and the philosophical interpretation of the Muslims on the teachings of Islam. It is itself the lasting contribution of the Philippine Muslims to the country’s national body politic. However, to know the Muslim history, one should understand the role of Islam in bringing about historical development. It is this Islam that actually produced heroic resistance against western colonialism. The Philippine Muslims today became known as cultural communities owing to their culture surviving foreign hegemonism to this day.</p><p></p><br />

Microscopy is the science of investigating small objects and structures using a microscope. Microscopic means being invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.<p></p>WHAT ARE THE PARTS OF MICROSCOPE?<p></p>Compound Microscope Parts<p></p>A high power or compound microscope achieves higher levels of magnification than a stereo or low power microscope. It is used to view smaller specimens such as cell structures which cannot be seen at lower levels of magnification. Essentially, a compound microscope consists of structural and optical components. However, within these two basic systems, there are some essential components that every microscopist should know and understand. These key microscope parts are illustrated and explained below.<p></p>STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS<p></p>The three basic, structural components of a compound microscope are the head, base and arm.<p></p>Head/Body houses the optical parts in the upper part of the microscope<p></p>Base of the microscope supports the microscope and houses the illuminator<p></p>Arm connects to the base and supports the microscope head. It is also used to carry the microscope.<p></p>When carrying a compound microscope always take care to lift it by both the arm and base, simultaneously.<p></p>#carry on learning<p></p><p></p><br />
