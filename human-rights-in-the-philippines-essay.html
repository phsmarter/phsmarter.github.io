                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way. If you were to be asked about the bill, what is your stand it? Do you support the bill into becoming a law or would you agree on what the opposition stated? Tell us what is on your mind! Write a persuading three-paragraph essay focusing on your position about it.
On the first paragraph, briefly discuss the bill with your stand. On the second paragraph, enumerate and explain your reasons and on the concluding paragraph, give your final message addressed to the government and fellowmen.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>human rights protect all people regardless of race ,nationality,gender,religion and political learnings,among others.They should be respected without prejudice.</p><p>Human rights can also be classified under individual,collective,civil,political,economic and social and cultural.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Human rights in the Philippines pertains to the concept, practice of human rights within the Philippine archipelago. The concept of "human rights," in the context of the Philippines, pertains mainly (but is not limited) to the civil and political rights of a person[1] living in the Philippines by reason of the 1987 Philippines Constitution.[2]Human rights are a justified set of claims that set moral standards to members of the human race, not exclusive to a specific community or citizenship.[3] Membership in the human race is the sole qualification to obtain these rights.[3] Human rights, unlike area-specific conventions of international laws (e.g. European Convention on Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights),[3] are universally justifiable as it pertains to the entire human race, regardless of geographical location.[3]</p><p></p><p>The Philippines is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) drafted by the United Nations (UN) in the 1948.[4] The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted, alongside the Genocide Convention and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, by the United Nations in response to the tragic and horrendous violations of human rights during the Second World War.[5] The United Nations Charter, a treaty, was created in order to define what roles, powers, and duties the United Nations is allowed to practice in dealing with international relations.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay:</p><p></p><p>1. Three Generations of Human Rights</p><p></p><p>Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that every individual is entitled to, simply because they are human beings. These rights have been categorized into three generations based on the time period and the focus of the rights.</p><p></p><p>First Generation: Civil and Political Rights</p><p>The first generation of human rights includes civil and political rights, which were first recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person, freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and association, as well as the right to a fair trial and freedom from torture, slavery, and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>Second Generation: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</p><p>The second generation of human rights emerged in the mid-20th century and focused on economic, social, and cultural rights. These rights include the right to education, work, social security, healthcare, and a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of the individual and their family.</p><p></p><p>Third Generation: Collective Rights</p><p>The third generation of human rights arose in the latter half of the 20th century and focuses on collective rights. These include the right to peace, a clean and healthy environment, and the right to self-determination of peoples and their cultures.</p><p></p><p>2. Sources of Human Rights Law in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Constitution and laws are the primary sources of human rights law in the Philippines. The 1987 Constitution specifically enumerates the civil and political rights, as well as economic, social, and cultural rights of all Filipino citizens. The Bill of Rights, in particular, outlines the fundamental rights of individuals and imposes limitations on the power of the state to ensure the protection of these rights.</p><p></p><p>International law is also a source of human rights law in the Philippines. The Philippines has ratified several international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. These treaties have become part of Philippine law and are recognized as sources of human rights law.</p><p></p><p>3. Personal Opinion on Human Rights Issues in our Country</p><p></p><p>As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions. However, I can provide a general statement on human rights issues in the Philippines. Despite the existence of laws and treaties protecting human rights, violations of these rights still occur in the Philippines. Human rights abuses such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture continue to be reported. There is a need for the government to uphold its commitment to protecting and promoting human rights and for individuals to be aware of their rights and actively advocate for them.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity​</strong></p><p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are two crucial aspects of a person's identity that have been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. While some argue that individuals should have the right to express themselves and love who they choose, others argue that certain sexual orientations and gender identities are unnatural or immoral. However, it is important to recognize that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, sexual orientation is a natural and normal part of human diversity. People can have different sexual orientations, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual. It is not a choice but rather an inherent characteristic of an individual's identity. People cannot control who they are attracted to, and it is not something that can be changed or "cured" through therapy or other methods. Therefore, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of sexual orientations.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, gender identity is also an inherent part of a person's identity. Gender identity refers to an individual's sense of their own gender, which can be male, female, or non-binary. Like sexual orientation, gender identity is not a choice but rather a part of who a person is. It is important to recognize and respect the gender identity of individuals, regardless of whether it aligns with their biological sex.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ often face discrimination and marginalization in society. This discrimination can manifest in many ways, including harassment, violence, and unequal treatment in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare. This discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, and can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>In addition to discrimination, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ also face legal barriers that limit their rights and freedoms. For example, in many countries, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and LGBTQ+ individuals are denied the right to adopt children or access fertility treatments. These legal barriers can further contribute to the marginalization and discrimination of LGBTQ+ individuals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected. Discrimination and marginalization of individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity are not only unfair but also harmful. It is important for society to recognize the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting world for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p></p><br />

                            9. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way. If you were to be asked about the bill, what is your stand it? Do you support the bill into becoming a law or would you agree on what the opposition stated? Tell us what is on your mind! Write a persuading three-paragraph essay focusing on your position about it.
On the first paragraph, briefly discuss the bill with your stand. On the second paragraph, enumerate and explain your reasons and on the concluding paragraph, give your final message addressed to the government and fellowmen.

Does the duterte administration war on drugs violated human rights, do the ICC has a jurisdiction over the cases of human rights violations in the Philippines if there's is any?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Duterte administration's war on drugs has been a contentious issue both within the Philippines and internationally. While the government has argued that the campaign is necessary to combat drug-related crime and protect the safety of citizens, critics have accused the administration of widespread human rights violations.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary concerns raised by human rights advocates is the use of extrajudicial killings and the lack of due process in the handling of suspected drug offenders. Human rights groups have documented numerous cases of individuals being killed without a trial or evidence of wrongdoing, raising concerns about the government's commitment to upholding basic human rights.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Constitution guarantees the right to due process and the protection of human rights, including the right to life and liberty. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights also affirms these principles, which are recognized internationally as fundamental to human dignity and justice.</p><p></p><p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is a global institution established to investigate and prosecute war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. The ICC has the authority to investigate and prosecute crimes committed by individuals, including government officials, regardless of their position or nationality. However, for the ICC to exercise its jurisdiction over cases, a country must either be a member of the ICC or have accepted the court's jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines is a member of the ICC, having ratified the Rome Statute in 2011. As such, the ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committed in the Philippines, including human rights violations. However, in 2018, the Philippine government announced its withdrawal from the ICC, claiming that the court's investigation into the war on drugs was politically motivated and an infringement of national sovereignty.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Duterte administration's war on drugs has raised serious concerns about human rights violations, particularly regarding due process and extrajudicial killings. The Philippine Constitution and the international community recognize the importance of upholding human rights and due process, and it is the government's responsibility to ensure that these rights are protected. While the ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committed in the Philippines, the government's decision to withdraw from the court has complicated efforts to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for human rights violations.</p><p></p><br />

                            11. Answer the following questions using own words "ESSAY"
1. What are the three views on human rights, what do you think is the most applicable in today's Philippine society?
2. In your own words, discuss how these views are observed in modern Philippine society.
A. Western views of human rights
B. Socialist view of human rights
C. Religious view of human rights</h2><br />
                        <p>1) Human rights are considered as the basic rights and freedoms that every person is entitled to, simply because they are human beings. These rights are considered inherent to human beings and are believed to be universal, inalienable, and indivisible. There are three main views on human rights: the Western view, the Socialist view, and the Religious view.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the most applicable view of human rights in today's Philippine society, it is difficult to determine a single view that is most applicable. Each view has its strengths and weaknesses and can be applied to different situations and issues. The most important thing is to recognize and promote the universality and indivisibility of all human rights, whether civil and political, economic, social, or cultural. It is also essential to respect and protect the rights of all individuals, especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized, regardless of their background, religion, or political beliefs. A comprehensive and balanced approach that recognizes the interdependence of all human rights is necessary to promote social justice and human dignity in Philippine society.</p><p></p><p>2) The Western view of human rights is based on the idea of individualism and liberalism, which emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and freedom from state interference. This view prioritizes civil and political rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, and the right to vote and participate in government. The Western view is typically associated with capitalist societies and is widely accepted in the Western world.</p><p></p><p>The Socialist view of human rights, on the other hand, is rooted in the principles of collectivism and socialism. It emphasizes the importance of economic, social, and cultural rights such as the right to work, education, healthcare, and a decent standard of living. The Socialist view also prioritizes collective rights and considers the state responsible for providing these rights to its citizens.</p><p></p><p>The Religious view of human rights is based on the idea that human beings are created by God and therefore have inherent dignity and worth. This view emphasizes the importance of moral and ethical values and promotes the protection of human life and dignity. The Religious view also considers the family and community as essential elements of society and prioritizes the rights of the vulnerable and marginalized.</p><p></p><p>In the Philippines, all three views of human rights have been observed in modern society. The Western view is evident in the country's Constitution, which guarantees civil and political rights to all citizens. The right to free speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to vote are all protected under the law. However, these rights are not always fully realized due to issues such as political repression, censorship, and violence against political activists and journalists.</p><p></p><p>The Socialist view is also observed in modern Philippine society, particularly in the government's efforts to promote social welfare programs and poverty reduction. The government provides subsidies for basic necessities, such as housing, healthcare, and education, and implements programs to address unemployment and poverty. However, the implementation of these programs has been criticized for being insufficient and ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the Religious view of human rights is widely embraced in Philippine society, where religion plays a significant role in people's lives. The Catholic Church, in particular, is influential in promoting moral and ethical values and advocating for the protection of human life and dignity. The Church is also active in providing humanitarian aid and social services to vulnerable and marginalized communities.</p><p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />
