                                            PAKI ANSWER PO PLSSIn 1942. While hiding from the German Nazis in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Anne Frank wrote the following entry in her diary. Read the Diary entry below.October 9th 1942. “Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report.  Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is  treating them very roughly Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is treating them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to Westerbork, the big camp in Drenthe to which they're sending all the Jews. Miep told us about someone who'd managed to escape from there. It must be terrible in Westerbork. The people get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink, as water is available only one hour a day, and there's only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women sleep in the same room, and women and children often have their heads shaved. Escape is almost impossible; many people look Jewish, and they're branded by their shorn heads.If it's that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and uncivilized places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of them are being murdered. The English radio says they're being gassed. Perhaps that's the quickest way to die. I feel terrible. Miep's accounts of these horrors are so heartrending, and Miep is also very distraught. The other day, for instance, the Gestapo deposited an elderly, crippled Jewish woman on Miep's doorstep while they set off to find a car. The old woman was terrified of the glaring searchlights and the guns firing at the English planes overhead. Yet Miep didn't dare let her in. Nobody would. The Germans are generous enough when it comes to punishment.Bep is also very subdued. Her boyfriend is being sent to Germany. Every time the planes fly over, she's afraid they're going to drop their entire bomb load on Bertus's head. Jokes like "Oh, don't worry, they can't all fall on him" or "One bomb is all it takes" are hardly appropriate in this situation. Bertus is not the only one being forced to work in Germany. Trainloads of young men depart daily. Some of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small station, but only a few manage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide.But that's not the end of my lamentations. Have you ever heard the term "hostages"? That's the latest punishment for saboteurs. It's the most horrible thing you can imagine. Leading citizens -- innocent people -- are taken prisoner to await their execution. If the Gestapo can't find the saboteur, they simply grab five hostages and line them up against the wall. You read the announcements of their death in the paper, where they're referred to as "fatal accidents.'Fine specimens of humanity, those Germans, and to think I'm actually one of them! No, that's not true, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. And besides, there are no greater enemies on earth than the Germans and the Jews.Instruction: Answer the following questions about Anne Frank’s diary entry above.1.Make a list of all the adjectives and adverbs that you find in the diary entry. What do these words reveal about the emotional state of the writer? 2. Comment on the way the diary entry was organized. How is this diary entry the same or different from another piece of writing such as an explanation essay? 3. Comment on the tone of the diary entry. How is it different from the tone used in an explanation essay? PAKI ANSWER PO PLSS ​</a>

1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                                            ASSESS Directions: Identify if the following articles is an Informative essay or not. Write check (/) If It is an informative essay and cross (X) if not. 1. What can we do to have a healthy circulatory system? Don't smoke!...Take vitamin E to keep the arteries supple. Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</a>

                            6. PAKI ANSWER PO PLSSIn 1942. While hiding from the German Nazis in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Anne Frank wrote the following entry in her diary. Read the Diary entry below.October 9th 1942. “Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report.  Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is  treating them very roughly Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is treating them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to Westerbork, the big camp in Drenthe to which they're sending all the Jews. Miep told us about someone who'd managed to escape from there. It must be terrible in Westerbork. The people get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink, as water is available only one hour a day, and there's only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women sleep in the same room, and women and children often have their heads shaved. Escape is almost impossible; many people look Jewish, and they're branded by their shorn heads.If it's that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and uncivilized places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of them are being murdered. The English radio says they're being gassed. Perhaps that's the quickest way to die. I feel terrible. Miep's accounts of these horrors are so heartrending, and Miep is also very distraught. The other day, for instance, the Gestapo deposited an elderly, crippled Jewish woman on Miep's doorstep while they set off to find a car. The old woman was terrified of the glaring searchlights and the guns firing at the English planes overhead. Yet Miep didn't dare let her in. Nobody would. The Germans are generous enough when it comes to punishment.Bep is also very subdued. Her boyfriend is being sent to Germany. Every time the planes fly over, she's afraid they're going to drop their entire bomb load on Bertus's head. Jokes like "Oh, don't worry, they can't all fall on him" or "One bomb is all it takes" are hardly appropriate in this situation. Bertus is not the only one being forced to work in Germany. Trainloads of young men depart daily. Some of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small station, but only a few manage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide.But that's not the end of my lamentations. Have you ever heard the term "hostages"? That's the latest punishment for saboteurs. It's the most horrible thing you can imagine. Leading citizens -- innocent people -- are taken prisoner to await their execution. If the Gestapo can't find the saboteur, they simply grab five hostages and line them up against the wall. You read the announcements of their death in the paper, where they're referred to as "fatal accidents.'Fine specimens of humanity, those Germans, and to think I'm actually one of them! No, that's not true, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. And besides, there are no greater enemies on earth than the Germans and the Jews.Instruction: Answer the following questions about Anne Frank’s diary entry above.1.Make a list of all the adjectives and adverbs that you find in the diary entry. What do these words reveal about the emotional state of the writer? 2. Comment on the way the diary entry was organized. How is this diary entry the same or different from another piece of writing such as an explanation essay? 3. Comment on the tone of the diary entry. How is it different from the tone used in an explanation essay? PAKI ANSWER PO PLSS ​</h2><br />

                        <p></p><p>Participating in an Essay Writing Competition organized by the Writer's Circle for Earth Day is such an exciting opportunity. I feel honored to have been chosen to represent my class in this competition. To gather information for my essay, I decided to watch some videos about the environmental impacts of tourism. I carefully listened to the information provided and observed the key points discussed. Now, I am ready to write my essay based on the data I have gathered.</p><p></p><p>Tourism is undoubtedly a popular industry that brings numerous benefits to countries around the world. However, it is important to recognize that it also has significant environmental consequences. The environmental impacts of tourism are vast and diverse, affecting various aspects of our natural surroundings.</p><p></p><p>One major environmental concern related to tourism is the degradation of natural habitats and ecosystems. As tourist destinations become increasingly popular, they often undergo extensive development to accommodate the growing number of visitors. This development includes the construction of hotels, resorts, roads, and other infrastructure. Unfortunately, such activities can lead to deforestation, habitat loss, and disruption of delicate ecosystems. For instance, the clearing of land for hotel construction can destroy valuable forested areas, displacing native species and endangering biodiversity.</p><p></p><p>Another environmental impact of tourism is the strain it puts on water resources. Tourist activities often require large amounts of water, whether for swimming pools, golf courses, or even basic needs such as drinking and sanitation. In regions where water is already scarce, the increased demand from tourism can lead to over-extraction and depletion of local water sources. This not only affects the availability of water for local communities but also harms aquatic ecosystems and wildlife that depend on these water bodies.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the transportation sector associated with tourism contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Tourists typically travel long distances to reach their desired destinations, often by airplanes, which are a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the use of vehicles for sightseeing and transportation within tourist destinations adds to the pollution. The emission of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter can have detrimental effects on air quality, leading to respiratory problems and other health issues for both local communities and visitors alike.</p><p></p><p>To mitigate these environmental impacts, sustainable tourism practices must be embraced. One approach is promoting eco-tourism, which focuses on low-impact activities that conserve natural resources and support local communities. Eco-friendly accommodations and tours that emphasize environmental education and conservation efforts can help minimize the negative effects of tourism. Additionally, implementing measures to reduce energy and water consumption, managing waste effectively, and encouraging the use of public transportation or cycling can contribute to sustainable tourism practices.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, tourism undoubtedly brings economic benefits and cultural exchange, but it also has significant environmental implications. The degradation of natural habitats, water resource depletion, and air pollution are among the environmental impacts of tourism. It is essential for both tourists and industry stakeholders to adopt sustainable practices to minimize these negative effects. By promoting eco-tourism and implementing conservation measures, we can ensure that tourism remains a positive force without compromising the well-being of our environment.</p><br />

                            8. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A descriptive paragraph provides a vibrant experience for the reader through vivid language and descriptions of something. Unlike narrative paragraphs, which must include personal thoughts, feelings, and growth, descriptive paragraphs do not need to be personal in nature. Instead, descriptive paragraphs must focus on vividly and objectively describing something to the reader. In order to provide this vivid detail, the writer must use language that appeals to the reader’s five senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch. To appeal to these senses, the writer must use descriptive language, usually in the form of adjectives, that describes the sensations felt by the senses. For instance, examine the differences between the descriptions below:Sentence 1: The tree was tall and green.Sentence 2: The soft and damp pink flowers of the dogwood tree smelled sweet in the cool spring air as the wind whistled through its yellow-green leaves.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>plss </strong></p><p><strong>na </strong><strong>banned </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>kasi acc </strong><strong>ko</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Christmas
</p><p>	Christmas is a festival celebrated around the world by Christians and even non-Christians. The festival commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ, who would go on to establish Christianity. It is also one of the biggest annual festivals in the world, with billions of people taking part in its celebrations. Time is also spent with family and friends, exchanging gifts and having a blast. Christmas is one of the biggest festivals celebrated around the world. It is also popular in countries where the numbers of Christians are relatively small.

                            15. ASSESS Directions: Identify if the following articles is an Informative essay or not. Write check (/) If It is an informative essay and cross (X) if not. 1. What can we do to have a healthy circulatory system? Don't smoke!...Take vitamin E to keep the arteries supple. Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</h2><br />
