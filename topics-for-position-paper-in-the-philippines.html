The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

The plan seems to be flawed from the start. With so many students, especially in public schools, it would be hard to give each one equal and undivided attention. Teachers also struggle to reach out to all of their students but fall short because economic and social factors stand in their way.</p><p>          The module relies on their knowledge and patience to teach the student whatever concept they don’t understand. In most middle-class homes where at least one person has access to data or an internet connection, this might not pose much of a problem. Additionally, at least one person in middle-class families has attended college. This means they have access to education and resources. But this may not be the case for lower-income families.In families where both parents are absent, trying to make ends meet, and no one has gone to college because of poverty, modular learning might not work at all. Lessons are limited to what’s written on paper. Without another more knowledgeable person who can explain these complicated concepts, the student will definitely have difficulty absorbing their lessons.</p><p>          With the current setup DepEd has for its teachers and students, the possibility of anyone genuinely learning anything is low. First off, modules are not substitutes for teachers. Like what has been mentioned above, without a knowledgeable person around who can explain confusing or complicated concepts written in the module, the student won’t understand it.</p><p><strong>C</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>There are a lot more challenges concerning modular learning, but these are the most prevalent. Both the students and the teachers are at a disadvantage. The quality of education, however hard it is to admit, may have dropped. But because we’re still in the middle of a pandemic, it’s not their fault. Learning is hard when done on your own.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS!

Mobile vs. PC games: the battle for popularity and longevity​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: Mobile vs. PC games: the battle for popularity and longevity</p><p></p><p>As technology advances, the world of gaming has evolved with it. With the increasing availability of mobile devices, gaming has become more accessible than ever before. However, the debate between mobile games and PC games continues to rage on, with gamers on both sides staunchly defending their preferred platform. In this position paper, I argue that while mobile games have certainly grown in popularity, PC games remain the superior option in terms of longevity and overall gaming experience.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, PC games offer a level of depth and complexity that mobile games simply cannot match. The larger screen, more powerful hardware, and ability to use a keyboard and mouse make it easier to create more intricate games with more advanced graphics and gameplay mechanics. While mobile games have made great strides in recent years, they still tend to be more simplistic and casual, often lacking the depth and challenge that many gamers crave.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, PC games tend to have a longer lifespan than their mobile counterparts. Mobile games often rely on constant updates and new content to keep players engaged, with many games losing their popularity and player base within a few months of release. In contrast, PC games often have larger and more dedicated communities, with many games maintaining their popularity for years, if not decades. This is partly due to the fact that PC games tend to be more mod-friendly, allowing players to customize and extend the game in a way that keeps it fresh and interesting.</p><p></p><p>It's also worth noting that while mobile games are more accessible than PC games, they are often plagued by issues such as microtransactions and ads. Many mobile games are designed with the intention of making money through in-game purchases, which can create a frustrating and unfair gaming experience for those who are unwilling or unable to spend money. In contrast, PC games tend to offer a more level playing field, with most games offering a one-time purchase price or a subscription fee that gives players access to all content.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this isn't to say that mobile games are inherently bad or that PC games are the only way to play. There are certainly some great mobile games out there that provide a fun and engaging experience, and many gamers prefer the convenience of being able to play on-the-go. However, when it comes to longevity and overall gaming experience, I firmly believe that PC games are the superior option.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while mobile games have certainly gained in popularity in recent years, PC games remain the superior option for those looking for a more immersive and long-lasting gaming experience. The depth and complexity of PC games, combined with the ability to mod and extend the game, create a level of engagement and community that is unmatched in the world of mobile gaming. While mobile games certainly have their place, PC games are the true champions of the gaming world.</p><p></p><br />
