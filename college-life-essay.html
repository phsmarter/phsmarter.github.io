                            3. ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAYreason should get a college degree to be successful in life?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Getting a college degree is a significant step towards achieving success in life. While some people may argue that college degrees are not necessary to succeed, there are several reasons why having a college degree is essential. Firstly, a college degree provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their chosen fields. College graduates are equipped with critical thinking skills, communication skills, and problem-solving skills, which are necessary for success in the modern workforce.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, having a college degree increases an individual's earning potential. On average, college graduates earn more than those without a college degree. A higher salary allows individuals to enjoy a better standard of living, which can lead to greater opportunities for personal and professional growth.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, a college degree provides individuals with a broader range of opportunities. Many employers require a college degree for entry-level positions, and a college degree can open doors to higher-level positions with more significant responsibilities and higher salaries.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, obtaining a college degree is an achievement in itself. It requires dedication, hard work, and discipline, which are all traits that can lead to success in other areas of life. College graduates are often more confident and better equipped to face life's challenges.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some may argue that getting a college degree is not necessary to be successful in life, the benefits of having a college degree far outweigh the drawbacks. A college degree provides individuals with the knowledge, skills, and opportunities necessary to succeed in their chosen fields, increase their earning potential, and achieve personal and professional growth.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>KEEP ON LEARNING ^√^</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>9 Similarities Between High School and College</p><p>
</p><p>When ending high school, many people tell you that college is completely different and to expect a lot of changes. While there are many differences, such as moving away and the class schedule being a new adventure to master itself, there are a lot of similarities that make the adjustment not as scary as it seems to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>1) The people are the same</p><p>everyone had someone on their lives</p><p>who isnt quite right in the head</p><p></p><p>No, not the people themselves, but the overall types of people remain the same. You going to meet the jocks, the nerds, the student government. And just like in high school, many of the people will overlap into other groups. Just find which click or squad with which you find most at home and you are good to go.
</p><p>
</p><p>2) Clubs and Groups</p><p></p><p>Yes, there are many clubs on campus, even the small ones. They all cover many events and activities, from helping lead the school to chasing fake zombies and saving the campus from the Apocalypse. Most of the people who are in the club become best buds and tend to hang out outside of the club times. This is a good way also to meet new friends. Join the clubs! Get involved! It'll help in the long run.
</p><p>
</p><p>3) The Teachers, now the Professors</p><p></p><p></p><p>Yes, even the teachers are almost the same; they still serve the same function and they want their students to pass. Despite not seeing them everyday at the same hour, they are there to teach and to help their students learn the material. There are some that many warn against and others that many will recommend to death. Just trust your own head and do as you see best. After all, some you will see every semester and others you will see only once.
</p><p>
</p><p>4) The Upperclassmen, or the Guides to Survival
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p></p><p>The upperclassmen have been through the Freshmen Trial and endured the transition. Let them act as a guiding tool to help answer any questions. While they may intimidate some for their ranking, they are people and may be easier to talk to than the teachers at times. They may be busy, but they can and may want to help. Just meet one and say hi.
</p><p>
</p><p>5) Projects</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>A good reason why to make friends and befriend upperclassmen is projects. Every class has at least one and it can take a big chunk of time, effort, and ingenuity to complete and for a good reason. Most classes may take a project more than the test grade or just as much. Despite being evil and a time slayer, projects could be fun to do. Group projects may be a pain, especially if the others will not help, but you discover who you can trust with these projects.
</p><p>
</p><p>6) Everything at once?!</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The teachers know when nLaziness and Procrastination kill this 3-letter acronym. This was VERY important in high school, as it determines scholarships for college. It is still important, just not as major. It needs to be maintained for scholarships, passing to another upper-level class, yes, but that means that you can relax for some classes where a B or even a C is alright. But failing is NOT acceptable. The class that costs about $300 is not something to take lightly. Relax on it, but do NOT forget about it.
</p><p>
</p><p>7) The fearful one: GPA
</p><p>
</p><p>othing is going on, so they have a secret meeting and decide to assign everything at once. That seems to happen everywhere, no matter the insitution. This skill is good, as it tests focus, time skills, work efficiency, and most important, stress levels. Watch the stress! It can literally kill somebody, and not just physically.

                            23. essay about college education is necessary for everyone​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>College is really necessary to us because With more and more careers requiring advanced education, a college degree can be critical to your success in today's workforce. Research indicates that earning a degree can have a significant and expansive impact on your life. In general, succeeding without going to college is possible. After all, not all employers require degrees, and not all college graduates are employed. However, in some instances, the absence of a college degree can hinder benefits such as more career opportunities and higher lifetime earnings.</strong><strong><br />Here are some reasons why college is really important:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Increase Chances of Employment<br />It's not uncommon to see "bachelor's degree required" on job descriptions or listed as a preferred qualification. A 2020 survey by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) in collaboration with Hanover Research found that a growing number of employers deem college a good investment. An undergraduate program, which includes associate and bachelor's degrees, offers a combination of general education courses and specialized learning in a discipline that interests you. With these degrees, you'll develop both broad-based and field-specific knowledge. You may also have a chance to grow important hard and soft skills by participating in experiential learning opportunities, which are relevant, hands-on experiences you can translate to the professional world. Experiential learning takes many forms and may exist both in and out of the classroom. Additional types of experiential learning you might take advantage of in college include project-based assignments that partner with real organizations, internships, and student clubs and organizations. You can leverage these valuable experiences on your resume, in your portfolio of work, and during the job, interviews to show employers that you are a competitive candidate. Earning a college degree could also lead to greater career stability. According to BLS data, 3.5% of workers with a bachelor’s degree faced unemployment in 2021 compared to 6.2% of workers with only a high school diploma.<br />2. Expand Your Opportunities<br />A college degree can be the extra credential you need to land the dream job you've always wanted. Getting your bachelor's degree may also allow you to view your work as a career, not just a job.</strong></p><p><strong>A 2016 Pew Research Center report states that 77% of workers with a post-graduate degree and 60% of workers with a bachelor's degree believe their jobs give them a sense of identity, versus just 38% of those with only a high school diploma or less.</strong></p><p><strong>This idea still holds today. The Lumina Foundation and Gallup noted in The State of Higher Education 2022 Report that 61% of students enrolled in higher education are getting their degrees to find more fulfilling jobs. An example of this is recent graduate Victoria Meuse '22, who was able to advance to a teaching position with the help of her bachelor's degree. Meuse is a military spouse, and during the pandemic and her husband's deployment, she homeschooled her oldest daughter. This experience inspired her to continue teaching, and now with her degree, Meuse is starting a new role at her children's elementary school. "Right now, I love working at my kid's school. I think that the background in psychology has helped me a lot in understanding the students," said Meuse. "I'm deciding if I want my master's in psychology or my master's in education, but I'm not done. "While working in your degree program, you're choosing to study something that interests you in a field you desire to work or grow in.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Prepare for the Future</strong></p><p><strong>You can also gain practical life skills as a college student. For example, you will need to meet regular assignment deadlines for each class. The discipline and time management strategies you learn along the way can be applied to all aspects of your life, whether you're navigating projects at work or your family's busy schedule. Since your earning potential is typically greater as a college graduate, your degree may lead toward financial stability for you and your family. Your school's finance counselors can walk you through more than just how to pay for college. With their tips and advice, you may discover helpful budgeting techniques and learn more about financing options and processes that may be relevant to future investments—such as purchasing a car or a home. Homeowners are increasingly more likely to be college educated. Point2, an organization that reports on real estate market trends, analyzed U.S. Census data to find that 70% of homeowners in 2020 had some college education. Forty percent had at least a bachelor's degree.</strong></p><br />
