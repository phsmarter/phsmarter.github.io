What changes do you need to make in order to improve your study habits? 4.What distractions contribute to procrastination in your life? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Well, there was this one time in High School when I kept putting off studying for a final exam. I kept telling myself I had plenty of time and that I would study later. But before I knew it, the day of the exam had arrived and I realized I hadn't even looked at the material. I ended up getting a really low grade on the exam and it really affected my overall grade in the class. It was a hard lesson to learn, but it taught me the importance of time management and not procrastinating.Procrastination can really hold you back from reaching your educational goals. If you're constantly putting off assignments or studying, it can be really hard to catch up and keep up with the class material. It can also lead to a lot of stress and anxiety, which can make it even harder to focus on your studies. It's important to find ways to manage procrastination and stay on top of your work."To improve my study habits, I need to make sure I'm setting aside dedicated time for studying and staying organized with my assignments. I also need to find ways to minimize distractions and stay focused on the task at hand. One thing that might help is to break down larger assignments into smaller, more manageable chunks and setting deadlines for myself.For me, some of the biggest distractions are my phone and social media. I also find that my friends and family can be a source of distraction if I'm not careful. I think it's important to set boundaries and limit the amount of time I spend on these things, so I can focus on my studies.<p><strong>#CarryOnLeaning</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>[tex]\huge\color{cyan}{\rm{\fcolorbox{cyan}{black) {answer\::}]][/tex]</p><p></p><p>What Is an Analogy?</p><p>An analogy is something that shows how two things are alike, but with the ultimate goal of making a point about this comparison.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of an analogy is not merely to show, but also to explain. For this reason, an analogy is more complex than a simile or a metaphor, which aim only to show without explaining. (Similes and metaphors can be used to make an analogy, but usually analogies have additional information to get their point across.)</p><p></p><p>Meet One of Your New Instructors</p><p></p><p>CONTINUE</p><p>What Is an Example of an Analogy?</p><p>Consider this analogy, meant to communicate futility:</p><p></p><p>“What you’re doing is as useful as rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.”</p><p></p><p>Here, the speaker is using a simile to compare the task being done to the task of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. But, the ultimate goal is not just to compare one task to another, it is to communicate that the first task is useless—by comparing it to a similarly useless task, such as rearranging deck chairs on a ship that famously sank into the sea on its maiden voyage.</p><p></p><p>2 Different Types of Analogy</p><p>In writing, there are two predominant types of analogies:</p><p></p><p>Analogies that identify identical relationships. The modern word “analogy” actually comes from the ancient Greek word for “proportionality,” and Greek scholars used analogies to directly illustrate similar relationships between two pairs of words, often for the purpose of logical argument. These analogies take the form “A is to B as C is to D.” An example of an analogy that identifies an identical relationship is “Black is to white as on is to off.” In this example, the relationship between black and white (that they’re antonyms, or opposites) is exactly comparable to the relationship between on and off (on and off are also opposites).</p><p>Analogies that identify shared abstraction. This type of analogy compares two things that are technically unrelated, in order to draw comparisons between an attribute or pattern they share. For instance, consider the analogy, “Raising children is like gardening—nurture them and be patient.” This example compares the pattern that is similar in both raising children and gardening. This type of analogy is useful in writing because it can help make abstract ideas (like raising children) more concrete by drawing on readers’ background knowledge of familiar images (like gardening).</p><br />

3. How would you relate your findings to existing theories on the study?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The essence of research is to find more knowledge and add to the existing body of knowledge. How has your study contributed to the Body of Knowledge? This is one question students especially at the Masters or PhD level must answer one day. The body of knowledge (BOK) encompasses every field of study from medicine to soap making and even our regular sports. You may choose to look at it as a vast library that needs constant updates from brilliant and creative minds to solve newer issues in the society. If you do not contribute, posterity may suffer because they cannot rely on old data and theories to survive and keep up with the pace at which the world is evolving today coupled with rapid growth in technology. Just imagine if we were to be using research studies on Malaria conducted in 1890 to cure Malaria today...imagine how many people that will die as a result of no current work to show that nutrition has improved, life styles have changed, hygiene is getting better, mosquitoes are getting smarter, newer herbs and chemicals exist-now that is the essence of research! So do not feel bad when asked if your work will or has added to existing knowledge.</p><br />

The findings can inform policymakers, educators, and stakeholders in the education sector in developing strategies that can enhance the effectiveness of remote learning and improve students' academic performance.<br /><br />What is the general objective of the study? What group or sector will be benefited? How will they make the most out of the study after the problem has been solved, or the research has been done?<br />The general objective of the study is to determine the impact of technology on students' academic performance in remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study's findings can benefit educators, policymakers, and stakeholders in the education sector by providing insights on how to develop effective strategies that can enhance students' academic performance and improve their learning experience in remote settings. By incorporating the findings of this study, educators can tailor their teaching methods to adapt to remote learning and develop a more effective and efficient approach to educating students<br /><br /><br /><br />MAKE ME THE BRAINLIEST PLEASE<br />
