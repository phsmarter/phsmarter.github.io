are passionate about raising awareness of these issues and developing grass-roots
solutions. Poverty, unemployment and environmental legislation are the major issues
facing the country, and these problems have resulted in a large number of Filipinos
moving overseas for work. We believe social entrepreneurship can help address some
of the issues facing the Philippines at the moment.

About 250,000 Filipino children are living on the street, and parents use their children for begging.</p><p></p><p></p><p>   solution:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Increase minimum wage and social assistance rates and ultimately we need a basic/minimum income (by the way, we could and should do that tomorrow, easy!), and; </p><p></p><p>Create truly affordable, quality housing whether through de-commodification of housing, rent controls, refurb/retrofit/maintenance, or new public housing builds (by the way, creating jobs in the process).</p><p></p><p>Income and housing are the foundation from which we begin to support individuals as part of the community. People must be supported in their physical, mental and social well-being to maintain stability and achieve belonging, both as recovery from the trauma of homelessness and prevention against a constant cycle of new people.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines is located along the Ring of Fire, or typhoon belt. Because of this, the country has suffered from a tremendous number of deadly typhoons, earthquakes, volcano eruptions and other natural disasters. Annually, approximately 80 typhoons develop above tropical waters, of which 19 enter the Philippine region and about six to nine make landfall. The Philippines is named as the country most exposed to tropical storms in the world. Violent tropical storms, such as the latest Haiyan typhoon, can generate 10 times as much energy as the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Such drastic weather destroys homes, villages, and families. Often the survivors are the children, minus their parents. Natural disasters often give birth to orphans.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            12. The Philippines is faced with a number of issues that concern our organization. We are passionate about raising awareness of these issues and developing grass roots solutions. Poverty, unemployment and environmental legislation are the major issues facing the country, and these problems have resulted in a large number of Filipinos moving overseas for work. We believe social entrepreneurship can help address some of the issues facing the Philippines at the moment. Make a stand: Who is responsible for poverty in our country, government or people? Why?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The one who is responsible for this as for my opinion, is the Government. The government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state. The definition is a fact and should help people who needs help. But due to the lack of people working in the Philippines, and moving to other countries because they have huger profit than here in the Philippines. It's not either the fault of the people for not being satisfied enough at what amount of money they receive. It's hard to get jobs nowadays  so we just need to have a bit of suffering and we can achieve life.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>:33 I hope this helpss</p><br />

                        <p>In many ways, there are similarities between workers’ conditions today and those of indentured laborers during colonial times. For example, both groups were subject to forced labor under harsh conditions for long periods of time without pay; some worked on plantations while others labored in mines or factories. However, unlike modern-day migrant workers who migrate voluntarily, most indentured laborers migrated against their will. Additionally, although the Philippine government did not impose taxes on imported goods until 1902, these products benefited plantation owners at the expense of impoverished peasants living near coastal areas. This situation was aggravated after World War II and continued throughout the 20th century.</p><br />
