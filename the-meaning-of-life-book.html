Why does Schopenhauer think that suffering outweighs pleasure in life? Why does Schopenhauer reject God as a source of meaning in life?

What advice does Schopenhauer offer in terms of trying to inhabit a world with such woes? What arguments could one use to challenge him? Where do you stand on Schopenhauer's views, and why? Be sure to use concrete example to illustrate your points. Required Texts E.D. Klemke and Steven M. Cahn (eds.). The Meaning of Life, 4th Edition (Oxford 2017).

This verse is usually involved in the debate concerning eternal security. Does Revelation 22:19 mean that, after a person’s name is written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, it can at some time in the future be erased? In other words, can a Christian lose his salvation?but your name is still not mentioned in the book of life you will be thrown into hell​</a>

Denotation and Connotation are two ways of describing the meanings of words.  Denotation or denotative meaning of a word refers to the literal meaning or dictionary meaning of the word. Example: My mother takes good care of her ornamental plants. She waters them every day.  Connotation or the connotative meaning of a word refers to the emotional suggestion or other related meaning attached to the word. It may be positive (pleasant) or negative (unpleasant) Example: Mother waters her ornamental plants with love and care. She checks on them every day. ■ You can determine whether a word meaning is a denotative or connotative through the context or situation given in the sentence Values integration: Be an open-minded person Open-mindedness will help us learn and grow. Other people should be free to express their beliefs and arguments, even if you do not necessarily agree with those views. Accepting and considering others’ ideas is the same way of showing your respect towards them. 11. Her three daughters are her life’s roses. 12. Mrs. Santos grows lovely roses in her wide garden. 13.

                            21. What is book of life?In Christianity and Judaism, the Book of Life (Hebrew: ספר החיים, transliterated Sefer HaChaim; Greek: βιβλίον τῆς ζωῆς Biblíon tēs Zōēs) is the book in which God records the names of every person who is destined for Heaven or the World to Come.Revelation 22:19 says, “And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book” (KJV). This verse is usually involved in the debate concerning eternal security. Does Revelation 22:19 mean that, after a person’s name is written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, it can at some time in the future be erased? In other words, can a Christian lose his salvation?but your name is still not mentioned in the book of life you will be thrown into hell​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Becoming a light in the world is simply a symbolic way of stating that we, as disciples of the Lord, should be symbols of hope towards our brothers and sisters. In addition to this, the very concept of light in these scriptures has often gone hand in hand with the virtues of knowledge, goodness, and wisdom, thus proving the point that becoming a light in the world is to become one with the image &amp; likeness that God has set for us.</p><p>It is far too easy to simply fit into this environment. Simply go with the flow and live a life that is less stressful and within our comfort zone. Which brings us to the topic of how we can create light. 8:12 (NIV)</p><p></p><p>"I am the light of the world," Jesus said once more to them. "THE ONE WHO FOLLOWS ME WILL NOT WALK IN DARKNESS, BUT IN LIGHT."</p><p></p><p>This passage informs us that we must follow the Light of the World in order to make light!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Light is defined as life, as seen in John 1:4, “In Him was life; and the life was the light of men”.
