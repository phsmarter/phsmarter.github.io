                            1. similarities of the gorgon's head and the clash of titans​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Every time you read a book, and then go watch the movie, they don't follow the same events in the same order most of the time. Just as in the myth "Perseus" and the film, Clash of the Titans, the occurrence is not the same and some of the  causes of the events are not the same.There are various things happening in the movies that aren't even similar to any of the mythic stuff. These differences may either boost the plot, or simply make it less interesting.  
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>The first difference from the film, the titans 'war, and the "Perseus" myth is how Perseus was assigned to battle Medusa.  Polydects was to get married to a princess during the legend "Perseus." It was customary to give gifts to the princess during this period, but Perseus had no gifts to give to the princess, such as a horse.
</p><p>
</p><p>The second difference between the myth and the movie is that Perseus used various means of travel on his quest and took different routes to locate Medusa. In the legend Perseus was followed as a guide and to help with Athena and Hermes.  He and his crew sailed through the seas using a boat to pursue Medusa.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Perseus then picked up some noble men to accompany him during the film. To locate Medusa, he and his team  traveled along trails and up the mountains. Perseus and his friends faced several challenges along the way, such  as dragons and other evil creatures coming out to get him. Perseus used horses to guide him and his people on the long land voyage.
</p><p>
</p><p>The film's final distinction, the Titans 'Clash, and the "Perseus" story is how Perseus took the eye from the Three Gorgon Witches. Perseus entered the cave with the three Gorgons in the story, and saw them move the eye back and forth closely. As he was watching them, when the time was right when none of the sisters used it, he wanted to catch the eye. Then, with incredible speed, Perseus caught the witches 'eye and none of them even knew it.
</p><p>
</p><p>During the Titans 'film Battle, a god, Athena, sent Perseus a mechanical owl to support him. Once Perseus and his three  sister Gorgons were in the cave, he wanted to send the owl to go get the sisters 'eye. And when neither of the witches used the eye at the right time he would send his owl out to go catch the eye.  Perseus did successfully and then got the Three Gorgon Witches 'eye on him.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            3. What are the Similarities and Differences of the Gorgons head and the clash of the titans?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Both of the works have the same goal and that is to kill Medusa. </strong>The main difference is that in the Clash of Titans, some of the scenes were altered to create fascinating and new perspectives of the story.</p><p></p>Similarities:Both are inspired by the Greek Mythology story of Medusa.<br /><br />They all have one goal. To kill and get the head of Medusa.<br /><br />Medusa in both stories has the power of turning anyone into stones whenever they see her eyes.<br /><br />Both feature the Gorgons sisters who shared only one eye as their source of sight.<br /><br />The antagonist of both works is Medusa.<br />Differences:In the movie, Perseus was assigned to battle for medusa but in the myth, it was not clearly stated that Perseus should battle Medusa. It was Medusa's fate to fall because the gods no longer want her to suffer.<br /><br />The Gorgons are Medusa's sisters. In the movie, we see a completely different point of view because the main character was Perseus. In the myth, we only get a chance to witness Perseus at the end part of the story.<br /><br />There were a lot of challenges that Perseus faced before battling Medusa. Some of the scenes were already changed to create a different twist and to have a sense of new taste for the viewers' eyes.<br /><br />Some of the versions of Greek mythology feature that the Gorgon sisters were killed before they can go face Medusa. The myth also shows that medusa was taken advantage of by Poseidon which is why she got punished and transformed into what she looks like today.<br /><br /><p>If you want to know more about the differences between 'The Gorgons' and 'The Clash of Clans', you can head over to this link directly:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/731109</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Whenever you read a book and then go watch the movie, most of the time they don’t follow the same events in the same order. Just like in the myth “Perseus” and the movie, Clash of the Titans, the event are not all the same and some of the causes of the events are not the same either. Different things happen in the movies that are not even close to some of the things in the myth. These differences can either make the story better or just make it less interesting.</p><p></p><p>        The first difference from the movie, Clash of the Titans, and the myth “Perseus” is how Perseus was assigned to fight Medusa. During the myth “Perseus”, Polydects was going to get married to a princess. During this time it was custom to give gifts to the princess, but Perseus had no gifts such as a horse to give to the princess. So just out of know where, he said to ...view middle of the document...</p><p></p><p>Perseus agreed with the idea and left for his journey to kill Medusa and get her head.</p><p></p><p>        </p><p></p><p>The second difference from the myth and the movie is that Perseus used different ways of transportation and took different routes on his journey to find Medusa. During the myth, Perseus was accompied with Athena and Hermes as a guide and to help. He and his crew used a boat to sail across the seas to find Medusa.</p><p>Then during the movie, Perseus picked some noble men to accompany him. He and his crew traveled along trails and up mountains to find Medusa. There were many obstacles for Perseus and his crew along the way, such as monsters and other evil creatures out to get him. Perseus used horses to steer him and his men along the long journey on land.</p><p></p><p>        The last difference of the movie, Clash of the Titans, and the myth “Perseus” is how Perseus stole the eye from the Three Gorgon Witches. In the myth, Perseus found the cave with the three Gorgons and watched them closely pass the eye back and forth. As he watched them, he decided to grab the eye when the time was right when none of the sisters were using it. Then with extreme quickness, Perseus grabbed the eye from the witches and none of them even knew it.</p><p></p><p>        During the movie Clash of the Titans, Perseus was given a mechanical owl by a god, Athena, to help him. When Perseus was in the cave with the three sister Gorgons, he decided to send the owl to go get the eye from the sisters. So at just the right time when neither witch was using the eye he would send his owl out to go</p><p></p><p>grab the eye. Perseus did with success and he then had the eye of the Three Gorgon Witches.</p><p></p><p>        Movies are not always like the story in a book. There are always going to be a difference and those differences can be appealing or not depending on what you and can be either excellent or terrible depending on the person.like. Just like in the movie, Clash of the Titans, and the myth “Perseus” the events are different</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>its kinda long but hope it helps :))</p><br />

                            12. similarities and differences between clash of the titans and the Gorgon's head?​</h2><br />
                        <p>A British-American fantasy action film series called <strong>Clash of the Titans</strong> is based on the figures and stories of Greek mythology. The two most important lessons in this film are to value your own humanity and struggle for the affection of your family.</p><p></p><p>Greek mythology features the <strong>Gorgon</strong> as a monster. In the earliest examples of Greek literature, gorgons appear. Although there are many different types of gorgons, the term most frequently refers to three sisters who are said to have hair composed of live, poisonous snakes and hideous faces that turned all who saw their stone. Stheno and Euryale, two of the Gorgons, were traditionally thought to be immortal. However, their sister Medusa was not, and she was killed by the god and hero Perseus.</p><p></p><p>Here are the similarities and differences between Clash of Titan and Gorgon Head.</p><strong>Similarities</strong><p>Short mythical tales like Gorgon Head and The Clash of the Titans depict the legendary adventure of the hero Perseus. Ancient gods, goddesses, and demigods challenging challenges, and horrifying monsters and creatures are confronted by Perseus in both versions.</p><strong>Differences</strong>Perseus employed several modes of transportation on his quest and traveled multiple paths to find Medusa in the story, which is where the narrative and the movie diverge. In the myth, Athena and Hermes relied on Perseus as a guide and helper. He pursued Medusa in a boat through the waters with his crew.The narrative of how Perseus snatched the eye from the Three Gorgon Witches is told in the movie Clash of the Titans. When Perseus visited the cave where the three mythical Gorgons were, he observed them intently moving their eyes back and forth. When it was appropriate and none of the sisters were using it, he wanted to capture their attention while he was monitoring them. Then, with lightning speed, Perseus attracted the witches' attention, and nobody even noticed.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about</strong> conflict in Clash of Titan here https://brainly.ph/question/835498 </p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>author link</p><p>cristalblanco315</p><p>Ambitious</p><p>20 answers</p><p>1.5K people helped</p><p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Every time you read a book, and then go watch the movie, they don't follow the same events in the same order most of the time. Just as in the myth "Perseus" and the film, Clash of the Titans, the occurrence is not the same and some of the causes of the events are not the same.There are various things happening in the movies that aren't even similar to any of the mythic stuff. These differences may either boost the plot, or simply make it less interesting.</p><p></p><p>The first difference from the film, the titans 'war, and the "Perseus" myth is how Perseus was assigned to battle Medusa. Polydects was to get married to a princess during the legend "Perseus." It was customary to give gifts to the princess during this period, but Perseus had no gifts to give to the princess, such as a horse.</p><p></p><p>The second difference between the myth and the movie is that Perseus used various means of travel on his quest and took different routes to locate Medusa. In the legend Perseus was followed as a guide and to help with Athena and Hermes. He and his crew sailed through the seas using a boat to pursue Medusa.</p><p></p><p>Perseus then picked up some noble men to accompany him during the film. To locate Medusa, he and his team traveled along trails and up the mountains. Perseus and his friends faced several challenges along the way, such as dragons and other evil creatures coming out to get him. Perseus used horses to guide him and his people on the long land voyage.</p><p></p><p>The film's final distinction, the Titans 'Clash, and the "Perseus" story is how Perseus took the eye from the Three Gorgon Witches. Perseus entered the cave with the three Gorgons in the story, and saw them move the eye back and forth closely. As he was watching them, when the time was right when none of the sisters used it, he wanted to catch the eye. Then, with incredible speed, Perseus caught the witches 'eye and none of them even knew it.</p><p></p><p>During the Titans 'film Battle, a god, Athena, sent Perseus a mechanical owl to support him. Once Perseus and his three sister Gorgons were in the cave, he wanted to send the owl to go get the sisters 'eye. And when neither of the witches used the eye at the right time he would send his owl out to go catch the eye. Perseus did successfully and then got the Three Gorgon Witches 'eye on him.</p><br />

                            29. Compare the movie in clash of titans and gorgons head</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Greek gods and prayers</p><p>In the movie, the gods require the prayers of mortals to fuel themselves. No such concept exists in the myths. Rather, the gods are petty and violent and screw with the lives of mortals with no consequence. God of War captures this aspect particularly well.</p><p></p><p>Hades is not a villain</p><p>In the movie, Hades is antagonistic to the other gods as well as humankind. He seeks to usurp Zeus, dresses in all black, and is pretty much Voldemort with a beard.</p><p></p><p>In the myths, Hades is the most fair, just, and politically neutral of all the gods. He never actively tries to kill people, as he is just a ruler of the dead, not its messenger. Death is personified as Thanatos. As for Hades’ appearance, the ancient Greeks believed gems and minerals come from Hades’ domain (the underground). So the god was often depicted as very wealthy. Also, in the myth of Perseus, Hades actually lets him borrow his helmet of invisibility.</p><br />
