                                            ARGUMENTATION While expressing opinions or claims about an issue seems to be an easy thing to do, writing effective argumentative texts, such as an argumentative essay, is actually not. It requires a clear understanding of what argumentative writing is, knowing structural patterns of argumentative texts, employing techniques in researching and supporting a claim, as well as using language features appropriate for argumentation. Argumentative writing is sometimes called persuasive writing because it seeks to convince readers to support a stand on a certain issue. It also requires the writer to examine a topic or issue which involves the collection, generation and evaluation of exhibits and/or evidences. It further emphasizes the writer's agreement or disagreement on particular proposition. Proposition is very essential in argumentative writing. It serves as the point of reference of the argumentative writer. It is where the writer decides whether to express his/her agreement or disagreement. In doing so, it is necessary that he/ she gathers information and/or evidences that would support his/her stand. One of the most common forms of argumentative writing is an argumentative essay. An argumentative essay is an essay that presents a stand or a rationale on a given proposition or issue. In this essay, the main argument presented is elaborated and explained through the presentation of its pros and cons. The main objective of an argumentative essay is to convince or persuade the reader into considering your stand or argument on an issue.. CALABARZON English G10​</a>

</p><p>vote. It is often said of him that he was “first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.” 
</p><p>Washington led comparatively untrained and ill-equipped American soldiers to victory over the well-trained British in 
</p><p>the Revolutionary War. As soon as the Constitution was ratified, he was chosen to be President.
</p><p>Many of the generals who had fought under Washington did not believe that the 13 colonies could cooperate to 
</p><p>form a single country without the strong leadership of a king. They approached him, saying that they would support 
</p><p>him as King George I of the United States. Washington was dismayed at the idea and asked the generals to promise 
</p><p>never to mention it again. He served two terms as President and refused a third term, retiring to his farm in Virginia. 
</p><p>When England‟s King George heard that Washington had voluntarily given up the power of the presidency, he said, 
</p><p>“If that is true, he is the greatest man in history.”
</p><p>According to the text, why was Washington considered the most popular president?
