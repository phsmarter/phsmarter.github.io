[Just Saying] The West Philippine Sea must be saved April 19, 2021 4:04 PM PHT 'China's communist officials may have thoroughly studied President Duterte's psyche and concluded that he cannot talk tough against China in the same way he talks tough against his own people! international tribunal. President Aquino's administration filed a case before the Hague international tribunal, resulting in a victory for the Philippines. The landmark decision was halled all over the world. The West Philippine Sea is again center stage in addition to COVID-19. In international law, there are four stages in case of international conflict - short of war - which the Philippines must undertake. Third, upon receipt of the decision, the Philippines must openly urge the losing country to abide immediately and strictly by the decision, with an admonition that noncompliance will result in further international recourse. President Duterte failed to do this upon official receipt of the West Philippine Sea ruling by his administration in the early part of its term. First, the Philippines should alert the world of the impending trouble. This is what is called "noisy," but not belligerent, diplomacy. President Aquino did that after exhausting to solve the problem through "silent" diplomacy. As head of state, he openly called China "a bully." He criticized China's intrusion, publicly declaring that China's movements in the South China Sea were comparable to Nazi Germany's expansionist agenda before World War 2. By his pronouncements, President Aquino warned the international community that the issues are not only a localized problem, but an international concern. He did the right move. China's garrisons and missiles strategically positioned in the South China Sea must be met by, at the very least, the Philippines' overt act manifesting the preparedness to invoke and operationalize the VFA and the MDT. China's awareness of a definitive retaliatory response from the US pursuant to the latter's VFA and MDT commitments in case of an attack on the Philippines can be an effective deterrent. The Philippines is in a serious mess. If not corrected, it will worsen, leaving an ugly legacy of President Duterte's leadership or, to be more precise, lack of it, in the West Philippine Sea - a facticity second only to Japan's Second World War Philippine occupation. The West Philippine Sea must be saved. Second, if nothing happens, a case should be filed with the -Mel Sta. Maria Questions: 1. What issue is discussed in the article that you have read? 2.

IPALIWANAGPINAS, CHINA NAGKASUNDO SA WEST PHILIPPINE SEAMANILA, Philippines — Matapos magpalitan ng maanghang na salita tungkol sa West Philippine Sea nitong mga nakaraang araw, nagkasundo na ang Pilipinas at China na resolbahin na sa pamamagiitan ng friendly consultation ang mga mahahalagang isyu para sa dalawang bansa.Ayon sa Department of Foreign Affairs, ang kasunduan ay nabuo matapos na hilingin ni Chinese Foreign minister Wang Yi ang virtual meeting kahapon kay DFA Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. Sinabi ng DFA na sa naturang meeting ay parehong iginiit nina Locsin at Yi na hindi ang maritime issues ang kabuuan ng ugnayan ng Piliipinas at China.Nagkasundo rin umano ang dalawa na pareho silang kikilos para sa pagtalakay ng mga itinuturing na issues of concern at parehong magsusulong ng maritime cooperation na may respeto, sinseridad at pagkilala sa sove-reign equality ng dalawang bansa.Ang pulong ng dalawang opisyal ay ginawa matapos ang pahayag ni Locsin na non-negotiable para sa PIlipinas ang pagkakapanalo nito sa arbitration case laban sa pilit na pag-aangkin ng China sa buong West Philippine Sea. Sagot naman ng China na illegal at invalid ang court ruling ng permanent court of arbitration na pumabor sa Pilipinas.(https://www.philstar.com/pilipino-star-ngayon/bansa/2020/07/16/2028302/pinas-china-nagkasundo-sa-west-philippine-sea)PAKSA: _______________________________________________LAYUNIN: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ KAHALAGAHAN NG PARTIKULAR NA AKADEMIKONG: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

Liquefaction Action, Possible Big One Reaction?
Consider the popular “Big One,” a magnitude 7.2 earthquake to be generated by the West Valley Fault. This predicted magnitude is lower than the 1990 Luzon earthquake. However, it is not something to be belittled. Given the population and urbanization of Metro Manila, the effects are expected to be devastating.
Let us Investigate!
Keeping in mind the geology of the area, the overlying man-made structures, and the strength of the earthquake, what degree of liquefaction can you expect from the “Big One?”
Do you think it will be similar to the liquefaction caused by the 1990 Luzon earthquake?</a>

Sagot naman ng China na illegal at invalid ang court ruling ng permanent court of arbitration na pumabor sa Pilipinas.(https://www.philstar.com/pilipino-star-ngayon/bansa/2020/07/16/2028302/pinas-china-nagkasundo-sa-west-philippine-sea)PAKSA: _______________________________________________LAYUNIN: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ KAHALAGAHAN NG PARTIKULAR NA AKADEMIKONG: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />

Rotate the globe or ball from west to east. As the globe or ball moves, drop a pen cap on the north polar region. Observe what happens to the pen cap. In what direction does the pen cap fall? Answer: • Why do you think the pen cap fell in that direction? Answer:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As an handsome boy, I don't have personal experience or perception to observe the activity you described. However, based on scientific principles, if you drop a pen cap on the north polar region of a rotating globe or ball that is spinning from west to east, the pen cap will fall towards the west. This is because of the Coriolis effect, which is the apparent deflection of objects (such as air mass and water) moving in a straight path relative to the rotating Earth.</p><p></p><p>The Coriolis effect causes objects to appear to curve to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Since the pen cap was dropped on the North Pole, it will appear to curve to the right or towards the west, as viewed from above the North Pole.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>please rate me five star and heart react thanks </p><br />

                            13.  PINAS, CHINA NAGKASUNDO SA WEST PHILIPPINE SEAMANILA, Philippines — Matapos magpalitan ng maanghang na salita tungkol sa West Philippine Sea nitong mga nakaraang araw, nagkasundo na ang Pilipinas at China na resolbahin na sa pamamagiitan ng friendly consultation ang mga mahahalagang isyu para sa dalawang bansa.Ayon sa Department of Foreign Affairs, ang kasunduan ay nabuo matapos na hilingin ni Chinese Foreign minister Wang Yi ang virtual meeting kahapon kay DFA Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. Sinabi ng DFA na sa naturang meeting ay parehong iginiit nina Locsin at Yi na hindi ang maritime issues ang kabuuan ng ugnayan ng Piliipinas at China.Nagkasundo rin umano ang dalawa na pareho silang kikilos para sa pagtalakay ng mga itinuturing na issues of concern at parehong magsusulong ng maritime cooperation na may respeto, sinseridad at pagkilala sa sove-reign equality ng dalawang bansa.Ang pulong ng dalawang opisyal ay ginawa matapos ang pahayag ni Locsin na non-negotiable para sa PIlipinas ang pagkakapanalo nito sa arbitration case laban sa pilit na pag-aangkin ng China sa buong West Philippine Sea. Sagot naman ng China na illegal at invalid ang court ruling ng permanent court of arbitration na pumabor sa Pilipinas.(https://www.philstar.com/pilipino-star-ngayon/bansa/2020/07/16/2028302/pinas-china-nagkasundo-sa-west-philippine-sea)PAKSA: _______________________________________________LAYUNIN:_________________________________________________KAHALAGAHAN NG PARTIKULAR NA AKADEMIKONG: _____________________________________________________________________________ ​</h2><br />

                            14. Read and analyze the situation. Answer the questions comprehensively. Have you heard of the most feared "The Big One"? This will be the worst-case scenario of a 7.2-magnitude earthquake which can occur due to the movement of the West Valley Fault. This 100-kilometer fault runs through six cities in Metro Manila and some nearby provinces. How do this movement of the fault may affect Philippines geologically? How would this affect the lives of people?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The "Big One" is a hypothetical scenario that refers to a potentially devastating 7.2-magnitude earthquake that could occur as a result of movement along the West Valley Fault in the Philippines. This fault runs through six cities in Metro Manila and some nearby provinces, and is capable of producing a major earthquake that could cause widespread damage and loss of life.</p><p></p><p>Geologically, the movement of the West Valley Fault could result in ground displacement, landslides, and the formation of new faults or cracks in the ground. This could cause significant damage to infrastructure, including buildings, roads, bridges, and other structures, as well as altering the topography of the affected areas. This could also trigger secondary disasters such as fire, landslides, tsunamis, and others.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the impact on people's lives, a major earthquake like the "Big One" could result in loss of life, injury, and displacement for many people. It would likely cause widespread destruction of homes and buildings, cutting off access to essential services like electricity, water, and health care, and leaving many people without basic necessities. This would have a significant impact on people's livelihoods, and likely result in long-term economic and social consequences for the affected communities.</p><p></p><p>It is important to be prepared for such a scenario, by making sure buildings are built to withstand earthquakes, regular drills and simulations are conducted, and evacuation plans are in place. Also, people should be educated on how to prepare and respond to an earthquake, what to do during an earthquake, and how to stay safe and minimize damage. Emergency responders and government agencies must also be well-trained and equipped to respond to a disaster of this magnitude, so they can help minimize the loss of life and property, and help communities recover as quickly as possible.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

The mainstream international understanding will be that the arbitration result is binding on China. The international and regional discourse concerning the South China Sea will likely highlight the legal aspects of the disputes far more. The international press will constantly mention the tribunal’s ruling whenever there is any conflict or tension in the South China Sea. China will almost certainly be criticized by international media for not respecting the ruling. And Vietnam, depending on the specific outcomes of the Philippines’ case, could be more serious about initiating its own legal process against China.</p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p>Src:asia maritime </p><p></p><br />

                            25. CASE STUDY
Liquefaction Action, Possible Big One Reaction?
Consider the popular “Big One,” a magnitude 7.2 earthquake to be generated by the West Valley Fault. This predicted magnitude is lower than the 1990 Luzon earthquake. However, it is not something to be belittled. Given the population and urbanization of Metro Manila, the effects are expected to be devastating.
Let us Investigate!
Keeping in mind the geology of the area, the overlying man-made structures, and the strength of the earthquake, what degree of liquefaction can you expect from the “Big One?”
Do you think it will be similar to the liquefaction caused by the 1990 Luzon earthquake?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>To assess the degree of liquefaction that can be expected from the "Big One" earthquake in Metro Manila, several factors need to be considered.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>First, the geology of the area plays a crucial role. The soil and rock types in the area, as well as the depth of the groundwater table, affect the susceptibility of the ground to liquefaction. Areas with loose, sandy soil or poorly consolidated sedimentary deposits are more prone to liquefaction.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Second, man-made structures such as buildings, roads, and bridges can also affect the degree of liquefaction. The weight of these structures can increase the stress on the ground and make it more susceptible to liquefaction.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Third, the strength of the earthquake is a significant factor. Higher magnitude earthquakes generate more ground shaking, which can increase the likelihood and severity of liquefaction.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Considering these factors, it is difficult to predict the exact degree of liquefaction that can be expected from the "Big One" earthquake. However, given the population and urbanization of Metro Manila, the effects of liquefaction are expected to be significant and potentially devastating.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Regarding the comparison with the 1990 Luzon earthquake, it is possible that the degree of liquefaction caused by the "Big One" could be similar or even greater, depending on the specific factors mentioned above. It is essential to take the threat of liquefaction seriously and take appropriate measures to mitigate the potential damage, such as improving building codes and ensuring proper foundation design for infrastructure.</strong></p><br />

This fault 100-kilometer fault that runs through six cities in Metro Manila and some nearby provinces. How do this movement of the fault may affect Philippines geologically? How would this affect the lives of people?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The movement of these tectonic plates has resulted in the formation of many fault lines around the country. Fault lines are defined by geologists as slippage or fissures in a volume of rock caused by rock-mass movement. <strong>The movement of tectonic plates causes a huge fault within the Earth's crust. A fault line moving quickly can generate a lot of energy, which can cause a big earthquake.</strong></p><p></p><br />

[Just Saying] The West Philippine Sea must be saved April 19, 2021 4:04 PM PHT China's communist officials may have thoroughly studied President Duterte's psyche and concluded that he cannot talk tough against China in the same way he talks tough against his international tribunal.

China's awareness of a definitive retaliatory response from the US pursuant to the latter's VFA and MDT commitments in case of an attack on the Philippines can be an effective deterrent. The Philippines is in a serious mess. If not corrected, it will worsen, leaving an ugly legacy of President Duterte's leadership or, to be more precise, lack of it, in the West Philippine Sea - a facticity second only to Japan's Second World War Philippine occupation.
