Sa tradisyong Ilianon sila’y magkakapatid na anak ni Pamulaw. Si Agyu ay may apat na kapatid na babae, ngunit sina Yambungon at Ikawangon lamang ang binanggit sa epiko. Isang araw nagpadala si Agyu sa datung Moro ng siyam na komu-buu-buong pagkit sa pamamagitan nina Kuyasu at Banlak. Nagalit ang datung Moro dahil kakaunti ang pagkit pambayad, kaya’t kanyang ibinalibag ang pagkit kay Kuyasu na tumama sa may ulser. Gumanti si Kuyasu at kanyang sinibat ang datu na tinamaan sa dibdib. Nahulaan ni Agyu na magkakagiyera dahil napatay ang datu. Nagtungo sila sa Ilian at ipinasiya ni Agyu na magtayo ng kuta sa bundok ng Ilian. Ang mga mandirigmang Morong nagdaan sa Ilog Palangi ay dumating at nakita ang kutang ginawa ng mga Ilianon. Nakipaglaban sina Agyu sa mga Moro at halos naubos ang mga kaaway.Pagkatapos ng tagumpay, ipinasya ni Agyu na lumipat sa bayan. Pinili niya ang bundok ng Pinamatun. Hanggang narating nila ang bayang Tigyandang at dito sila sinalakay. Lumaban ang mga tauhan ni Agyu sa pampangin ng look ng Linayagon. Nang sila’y naubusan ng tauhan, ang batang anak ni Agyu na si Tanagyaw ay nagprisintang sasagupa sa mga kaaway. Napatay niyang lahat ang kalaban nang ikaapat na araw. Narating ni Tanagyaw ang bayang Bablayon. Nanghihilakbot ang mga tao rito at nang malaman niyang lulusubin sila ng mga kaaway o mananakop nanlaban at napatay ni Tanagyaw ang mga mananakop. Dahil dito ay ipinakasal ng datu ang kanyang anak kay Tanagyaw.Di nagluwa’t ang bayan ni Agyu ay nanganib din sa mga mananakop na galing sa ibayong dagat. Ang mga lalaki, bata at matanda ay sinabihang lumaban ngunit sila’y natalo. Hinulaan ng propeta ang malagim nilang wakas ngunit sinalungat at pinarusahan siya ni Tanagyaw. Nagbihis siya ng sampung suson makasiyam ang kapal at dinampot ang kanyang sibat at kalasag na hindi nasisira. Nilabanan niya ang mga mananakop sa dalampasigan. Naghambalong ang mga patay, patung-patong, na parang bundok at burol.Itinalaga ni Agyu ang bayan sa kanyang matagumpay na anak na nanirahan doon kasama ang kanyang kaakit-akit na asawa.‹ Mga Epiko ng PilipinasupAlim (Epiko nLearn this Filipino word:mga waláBack to top.Welcome Guest!About PhilippinesArts and Literature(active menu item)Literary Classics: Ibong Adarna, Florante at Laura, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo(active menu item)Ibong Adarna by an unknown author(active menu item)Florante at Laura by Francisco Baltazar(active menu item)Noli Me Tangere by Dr. José Rizal (Berlin; February 21, 1887)(active menu item)El Filibusterismo by Dr. José Rizal (Ghent, 1891)(active menu item)Works by Dr. José Rizal(active menu item)Mga Balagtasan (Poetical Debate)(active menu item)Mga Awit (Songs)(active menu item)Mga Tula (Poems)(active menu item)Mga Dula (Plays)(active menu item)Mga Parabula (Parables)(active menu item)Mga Alamat (Legends)(active menu item)Mga Kuwentong-bayan (Folktales)(active menu item)Mga Epiko (Epics)(active menu item)Mga Mitolohiya (Mythologies)(active menu item)Mga Bugtong (Riddles)(active menu item)Mga Tugmang Tagalog (Tagalog Nursery Rhymes)(active menu item)Sabayang Pagbigkas(active menu item)Mga Pabula (Fables)(active menu item)Mga Salawikaing Filipino (Filipino Proverbs)(active menu item)Directory(active menu item)Embassies and Consulates in the Philippines(active menu item)Newspapers Companies in the Philippines(active menu item)Television Networks in the Philippines(active menu item)Magazine Companies in the Philippines(active menu item)Colleges and Universities in the Philippines(active menu item)Language(active menu item)Learn the (Filipino) Language “Tagalog” (Free Online)(active menu item)Mga Kawikaang Tagalog (Tagalog Idioms)(active​</a>

                                            true or false 1. During the Pre-Spanish Period, Jose Rizal's works such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were written to awake the mind of the Filipino people. 2. Because of the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, its geographical features, and the presence of various ethno-linguistic groups in the country, regional literature has become rich and varied. 3. Oral and written literatures were not present in the Filipino culture before the colonizers came. 4. The most prominent characteristic of Philippine literature during the Spanish era was the use of religion as the content in the works of the early literature, 5. The separate, yet parallel developments of Philippine literature in English and those in Tagalog and other languages of the archipelago during the American period only proved that literature and writing in whatever language and in whatever climate were able to survive mainly through the active imagination of writers. 6. Poetry works during the EDSA I Period were romantic and revolutionary. 7. Doctrina Cristiana and Urbana and Felisa were written to support or contradict the Catholic Church during the Period of Enlightenment. 8. It was during the American Period when Filipinos witnessed newspapers which were once branded crony newspapers become instant opposition papers. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 9. Filipino literature was given a break during the Japanese period. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 10. The American Period presented new trends in writing using modern technology. 11. Poetry during the New Society Period was dealt with patience and regard for native culture and customs. 12. Philippine regional literature can be best described as dynamic. 13. Imagery in poetry pertains to mental pictures. 14. Literature developed alongside Philippine history is a valid observation of literary development in the Philippines. 15. The use of the vernacular in regional literature is encouraged so that the culture and tradition of a people are upheld despite effects of modernization.​</a>

                                            What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad. He wanted his voice to be heard by the world so that, in listening to him, the world could in turn help him in his crusade for reform. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Baybayin (Tagalog pronunciation: [baɪbaˈjɪn], pre-kudlit: ᜊᜊᜌᜒ, virama-krus-kudlit: ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔, virama-pamudpod: ᜊᜌ᜴ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜴; also incorrectly known as alibata) is a Philippine script. The script is an alphasyllabary belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. It was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries before being supplanted by the Latin alphabet during the period of Spanish colonization. It was used in Tagalog and to a lesser extent Kapampangan speaking areas; its use spread to Ilokanos in the early 17th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, baybayin survived and evolved into multiple forms—the Tagbanwa script of Palawan, and the Hanuno'o and Buhid scripts of Mindoro—and was used to create the constructed modern Kulitan script of the Kapampangan and the Ibalnan script of the Palawan tribe.[citation needed]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Sa tradisyong Ilianon sila’y magkakapatid na anak ni Pamulaw. Si Agyu ay may apat na kapatid na babae, ngunit sina Yambungon at Ikawangon lamang ang binanggit sa epiko. Isang araw nagpadala si Agyu sa datung Moro ng siyam na komu-buu-buong pagkit sa pamamagitan nina Kuyasu at Banlak. Nagalit ang datung Moro dahil kakaunti ang pagkit pambayad, kaya’t kanyang ibinalibag ang pagkit kay Kuyasu na tumama sa may ulser. Gumanti si Kuyasu at kanyang sinibat ang datu na tinamaan sa dibdib. Nahulaan ni Agyu na magkakagiyera dahil napatay ang datu. Nagtungo sila sa Ilian at ipinasiya ni Agyu na magtayo ng kuta sa bundok ng Ilian. Ang mga mandirigmang Morong nagdaan sa Ilog Palangi ay dumating at nakita ang kutang ginawa ng mga Ilianon. Nakipaglaban sina Agyu sa mga Moro at halos naubos ang mga kaaway.Pagkatapos ng tagumpay, ipinasya ni Agyu na lumipat sa bayan. Pinili niya ang bundok ng Pinamatun. Hanggang narating nila ang bayang Tigyandang at dito sila sinalakay. Lumaban ang mga tauhan ni Agyu sa pampangin ng look ng Linayagon. Nang sila’y naubusan ng tauhan, ang batang anak ni Agyu na si Tanagyaw ay nagprisintang sasagupa sa mga kaaway. Napatay niyang lahat ang kalaban nang ikaapat na araw. Narating ni Tanagyaw ang bayang Bablayon. Nanghihilakbot ang mga tao rito at nang malaman niyang lulusubin sila ng mga kaaway o mananakop nanlaban at napatay ni Tanagyaw ang mga mananakop. Dahil dito ay ipinakasal ng datu ang kanyang anak kay Tanagyaw.Di nagluwa’t ang bayan ni Agyu ay nanganib din sa mga mananakop na galing sa ibayong dagat. Ang mga lalaki, bata at matanda ay sinabihang lumaban ngunit sila’y natalo. Hinulaan ng propeta ang malagim nilang wakas ngunit sinalungat at pinarusahan siya ni Tanagyaw. Nagbihis siya ng sampung suson makasiyam ang kapal at dinampot ang kanyang sibat at kalasag na hindi nasisira. Nilabanan niya ang mga mananakop sa dalampasigan. Naghambalong ang mga patay, patung-patong, na parang bundok at burol.Itinalaga ni Agyu ang bayan sa kanyang matagumpay na anak na nanirahan doon kasama ang kanyang kaakit-akit na asawa.‹ Mga Epiko ng PilipinasupAlim (Epiko nLearn this Filipino word:mga waláBack to top.Welcome Guest!About PhilippinesArts and Literature(active menu item)Literary Classics: Ibong Adarna, Florante at Laura, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo(active menu item)Ibong Adarna by an unknown author(active menu item)Florante at Laura by Francisco Baltazar(active menu item)Noli Me Tangere by Dr. José Rizal (Berlin; February 21, 1887)(active menu item)El Filibusterismo by Dr. José Rizal (Ghent, 1891)(active menu item)Works by Dr. José Rizal(active menu item)Mga Balagtasan (Poetical Debate)(active menu item)Mga Awit (Songs)(active menu item)Mga Tula (Poems)(active menu item)Mga Dula (Plays)(active menu item)Mga Parabula (Parables)(active menu item)Mga Alamat (Legends)(active menu item)Mga Kuwentong-bayan (Folktales)(active menu item)Mga Epiko (Epics)(active menu item)Mga Mitolohiya (Mythologies)(active menu item)Mga Bugtong (Riddles)(active menu item)Mga Tugmang Tagalog (Tagalog Nursery Rhymes)(active menu item)Sabayang Pagbigkas(active menu item)Mga Pabula (Fables)(active menu item)Mga Salawikaing Filipino (Filipino Proverbs)(active menu item)Directory(active menu item)Embassies and Consulates in the Philippines(active menu item)Newspapers Companies in the Philippines(active menu item)Television Networks in the Philippines(active menu item)Magazine Companies in the Philippines(active menu item)Colleges and Universities in the Philippines(active menu item)Language(active menu item)Learn the (Filipino) Language “Tagalog” (Free Online)(active menu item)Mga Kawikaang Tagalog (Tagalog Idioms)(active​</h2><br />

                            10. What persuasive words did Rizal say for writing in a language other than his native tongue?But Rizal, too, was a practical man. As he grew up, he realized that Tagalog has its limitation, that the other people in the world do not understand it. He wanted the whole world to read his writing, for he wrote of our country's beauty, and our country's miseries suffered at the hands of Spain. If he had written only in Tagalog, his voice would have been lost. Nobody would have heard it. So Rizal wisely tried to master as many languages as he could. That is why most of Rizal's literary works were written in Spanish. It is not because he loved Tagalog less, but because he wanted to reach as many hearts as he could, here and abroad.
