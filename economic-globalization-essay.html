                                            What are the Main Effects of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-8? From https://eas.epigeum.com The global financial crisis of 2007-08 has had a number of major interrelated effects. These effects are important and wide-ranging. This global financial crisis was arguably the most major crises of its type since the great depression of the 1920s and 1930s (Crotty, 2009), and was caused by various factors including the US sub-prime lending phenomenon, high consumer debt in many of the major advanced economies, and banking practices. This essay examines the most serious effects following the crisis and argues that their impact was not only financial and economic but also social and environmental (Peters, et al., 2012). First and foremost, the crisis was financial, but it was also social. In other words, the impacts were felt by ordinary people in serious ways. For instance, there was a significant tightening in the lending behavior of banks in western economies, particularly the USA and the UK. Many people were no longer able to get loans to buy houses, with access to credit made more difficult. Answer here​</a>

Regard to global actors, this means that their agency has socio-political impactin terms of exercising public authority beyond the state. Meaning to have good social lifeand to control any movement of the global economy in the country, these global actorsis representing the two state (Actors and Non-Actors). An ever-expanding body ofresearch has demonstrated that approaching the global realm as an international spacedefined as mainly interstate relations is at odds with contemporary socio-politicaldevelopments. Meaning there are media and Non-Government Organizationsdeveloped and give an update research to have an idea what is happening to the state.</p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><br />

In economics, globalization can be defined as the process in which businesses, organizations, and countries begin operating on an international scale. Globalization is most often used in an economic context, but it also affects and is affected by politics and culture.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Globalization is the word used to describe the growing interdependence of the world’s economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information. Countries have built economic partnerships to facilitate these movements over many centuries. This guide uses the term more narrowly to refer to international trade and some of the investment flows among advanced economies, mostly focusing on the United States. The wide-ranging effects of globalization are complex and politically charged. As with major technological advances, globalization benefits society as a whole, while harming certain groups. Understanding the relative costs and benefits can pave the way for alleviating problems while sustaining the wider payoffs.Globalization decrease the cost of manufacturing. This means that companies can offer goods at a lower price to consumers. Ang Average cost ng mga goods ay isang mahalagang aspeto na nag-aambag sa pagtaas sa pamantayan ng pamumuhay. Ang mga consumers ay mayroon ding access sa mas malawak na iba't ibang mga goods. Social and economic factors, such as income, education, employment, community safety, and social supports can significally affect how well and how long we live. These factors affect our ability to make healthy choices, afford medical care and housing, and manage stress and more. Economist generally agree that economic development and growth are influenced by four factors: human resources, physical capital, natural capital, natural resources and technology. Highly developed na bansa na naka focus sa mga lugar na ito. Ang mga hindi gaanong maunlad na countries, even those with high amounts ofnatural resources, will lag behind when they fail to promote research in technology at improve nila ang skills at education ng mga kanilang manggagawa dahil ang mga skills at education at training ng mga labor force ay may direct effect on the growth of an economy. A skilled, well trained workforce ay more productive at magpoproduce ng high-quality output that adds efficiency to an economy. Shortage ng skilled labor ay pwede pababain ang economic growth ng isang bansa at under-utilized, illiterate and unskilled workforce will become a drag on an economy and may possibly lead to higher unemploymen</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlest pagtama</p><br />

                        <p>Poverty and economic inequality are two terms that are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences. Poverty refers to a lack of access to basic needs such as food, shelter, healthcare, and education. On the other hand, economic inequality refers to the unequal distribution of wealth and resources among individuals or groups within a society. While poverty can be seen as a consequence of economic inequality, it is important to understand that poverty and inequality are not the same.</p><p></p><p>Economic globalization has been a significant force in shaping the global economy, but it has also contributed to rising poverty and inequality. Economic globalization refers to the increased interconnectedness and interdependence of economies around the world, resulting from the expansion of trade, investment, and technology. While economic globalization has brought significant benefits to many countries, such as increased economic growth and job creation, it has also contributed to a widening gap between the rich and the poor.</p><p></p><p>The impact of economic globalization on poverty and inequality has been a subject of much debate. On one hand, some argue that economic globalization has lifted millions of people out of poverty by creating jobs, increasing access to goods and services, and boosting economic growth. However, others argue that economic globalization has contributed to rising inequality by favoring the rich and powerful while leaving many behind.</p><p></p><p>The effects of economic globalization on poverty and inequality are complex and multifaceted. While globalization has created new opportunities for economic growth and development, it has also contributed to widening inequality and poverty in many countries. It is important for policymakers to address these issues by implementing policies that promote inclusive growth, social protection, and sustainable development.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty and economic inequality are two distinct but related issues that require different policy interventions. Economic globalization has brought both opportunities and challenges, and its impact on poverty and inequality is a matter of ongoing debate. By understanding the differences between poverty and inequality and working towards inclusive and sustainable development, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world for all.</p><br />

                            23. What are the Main Effects of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-8? From https://eas.epigeum.com The global financial crisis of 2007-08 has had a number of major interrelated effects. These effects are important and wide-ranging. This global financial crisis was arguably the most major crises of its type since the great depression of the 1920s and 1930s (Crotty, 2009), and was caused by various factors including the US sub-prime lending phenomenon, high consumer debt in many of the major advanced economies, and banking practices. This essay examines the most serious effects following the crisis and argues that their impact was not only financial and economic but also social and environmental (Peters, et al., 2012). First and foremost, the crisis was financial, but it was also social. In other words, the impacts were felt by ordinary people in serious ways. For instance, there was a significant tightening in the lending behavior of banks in western economies, particularly the USA and the UK.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>niversity</p><p>A day in the life of a student during COVID</p><p>Student working with mask and hand sanitizer on the table </p><p>November 24</p><p>As a student during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have spent a lot of time finding my new flow. I was the type of student who lived by the saying “The early bird gets the worm." I would often wake up early, get a couple hours of studying in every weekday before classes at either a coffee shop of on campus. I would usually work on assignments between classes, and I would sometimes stay on campus after class to finish up my work. When I went home, I was home, and I did a good job of not taking my work home with me. This is how I found balance, and it really worked for me!  </p><p></p><p>When campus had to be closed due to the government’s orders, classes transitioned to Zoom calls. Usually, most course material and class assignments were submitted online, so that part didn't change much, but there was a huge barrier I had to work hard to overcome: being home and doing school work. I had to get creative, so I set up a space in my dining room that acted as my office. I had a really fun time decorating it, putting plants in it for me to enjoy while studying, using candles and crystals to create a focused, calm environment. I bought an adjustable desk that I used to stand during lectures, which was a great way for me to switch things up when I started to feel distracted. I also bought a comfy seat cushion for when I needed to sit and study. I made the most of my classes and maintained my motivation by continuing to check in with my friends in my cohort, and scheduling out my days.  </p><p></p><p>Now when I have classes, I usually wake up at 7am, make some coffee, get dressed and have a fueling and delicious breakfast! My “work time” which consisted of Zoom lectures, working on assignments and studying was usually from 8am until 6pm. I would take a break mid-day and go for a nice walk around my neighborhood, often down to Lake Sammamish, and get a quick bite to eat when I got back. After my scheduled work time, I would enjoy time with my partner (who was living with me during the stay-at-home order), usually by cooking a home-made meal, watching a movie, making art and crafting or listening to audiobooks.  </p><p></p><p>There was a lot of restructuring and relearning how to be a student during the COVID-19 pandemic, but even with the added challenges and changes to the structure of the University because of COVID-19, the bonds between my cohort and my friends are holding strong. I still was able to get the most out of my classes (something I realized after reflecting on all I had learned during the school year!), and overall I still really value my experience during my second year. I think that speaks to the dedication of the administration, the dependability of the staff, and how invested our professors are.  </p><br />
