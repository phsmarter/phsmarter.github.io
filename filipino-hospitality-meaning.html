Fill in the diagram with details correctly synthesizing the essential information, "Hospitality is a trait displayed by every Filipino, characterized by heart warming generosity and friendliness exhibited to foreigners and locals alike, Filipinos receive guests, even strangers, in a warm and pleasant way, often going out of their way to make the visitor comfortable. It is a trait not confined to the upper class and can be found among the poorest members of society. Even today, when guests arrive in Filipino homes during mealtime, they are offered whatever is being served for that meal. Most of the time, a new meal is prepared to the liking of the visitor. The Filipino hospitality is best exemplified in regard to foreign guests, who are treated with the utmost respect. Filipinos enjoy the company of foreign visitors, and most foreigners who have visited the country can testify to the warmth and friendliness of the locals. Excerpt quoted from: Why Are Filipinos Known to Be Hospitable?  "What makes Filipinos different from many other nationalities is that they openly welcome you to become a part of them. Filipino hospitality is hospitality not only to Filipinos, but to everyone, including non-Filipinos. Perhaps it's because they have been colonized by Spain and subsequently the United States, so they are used to having foreigners around. However, what's amazing is that Filipinos are excited and proud to show you what it means to be Filipino and welcome you to partake in the Filipino culture as if it were your own. Unlike other cultures where foreigners have a difficult time integrating, many foreigners who visit the Philippines "feel at home."

                                            pa summarize po thank youuuuFilipino Hospitality Keeping strangers warm the Filipino way In ancient Greece, Telemachus was a complete stranger who happened to pass by the house of Nestor and was warmly welcomed befitting a family member. The stranger's feet were washed by the host and he was offered food and wine. Nestor's son even slept on a bed close to Telemachus to see to it that no ham would befall the stranger. In the Greek custom, only after the guest had been feeling comfortable would be the time for the host to ask his name. It happened that Telemachus was the son of Deysseus. Although he had no knowledge that the stranger was the son of the legendary king of Ithaca, Nestor nonetheless gave Telemachus equal treatment as if the stranger was part of the family. From the story was derived the modern meaning of hospitality to refer to the warm reception accorded by a host to a guest may he be a stranger or a known friend. This hospitality captures the Filipino tradition of receiving The status in life of the stranger does not matter to the Fipino host because the act of generosity is something inborn in them as a people. The Filipino hospitality would even go as far as guiding the stranger to his next voyage or travel itinerary, in the same way that Nestor provided Telemachus a horse so that he can reach soonest, while Nestor's own son Pisistratus drove for pinus would even provide protection and guidance for the ly if he is new to the area.

Fill in the diagram with details correctly synthesizing the essential information, "Hospitality is a trait displayed by every Filipino, characterized by heart warming generosity and friendliness exhibited to foreigners and locals alike, Filipinos receive guests, even strangers, in a warm and pleasant way, often going out of their way to make the visitor comfortable. It is a trait not confined to the upper class and can be found among the poorest members of society. Even today, when guests arrive in Filipino homes during mealtime, they are offered whatever is being served for that meal. Most of the time, a new meal is prepared to the liking of the visitor. The Filipino hospitality is best exemplified in regard to foreign guests, who are treated with the utmost respect. Filipinos enjoy the company of foreign visitors, and most foreigners who have visited the country can testify to the warmth and friendliness of the locals. Excerpt quoted from: Why Are Filipinos Known to Be Hospitable?  "What makes Filipinos different from many other nationalities is that they openly welcome you to become a part of them. Filipino hospitality is hospitality not only to Filipinos, but to everyone, including non-Filipinos. Perhaps it's because they have been colonized by Spain and subsequently the United States, so they are used to having foreigners around. However, what's amazing is that Filipinos are excited and proud to show you what it means to be Filipino and welcome you to partake in the Filipino culture as if it were your own. Unlike other cultures where foreigners have a difficult time integrating, many foreigners who visit the Philippines "feel at home."

The stranger's feet were washed by the host and he was offered food and wine. Nestor's son even slept on a bed close to Telemachus to see to it that no ham would befall the stranger. In the Greek custom, only after the guest had been feeling comfortable would be the time for the host to ask his name. It happened that Telemachus was the son of Deysseus. Although he had no knowledge that the stranger was the son of the legendary king of Ithaca, Nestor nonetheless gave Telemachus equal treatment as if the stranger was part of the family. From the story was derived the modern meaning of hospitality to refer to the warm reception accorded by a host to a guest may he be a stranger or a known friend. This hospitality captures the Filipino tradition of receiving The status in life of the stranger does not matter to the Fipino host because the act of generosity is something inborn in them as a people. The Filipino hospitality would even go as far as guiding the stranger to his next voyage or travel itinerary, in the same way that Nestor provided Telemachus a horse so that he can reach soonest, while Nestor's own son Pisistratus drove for pinus would even provide protection and guidance for the ly if he is new to the area.

                        <p>1We Filipinos have taken the slogan “reduce, reuse, and recycle” to heart. We like to maximize the lifespan of an object in every possible way, lest it go to waste. This is one of our positive habits until we invite guests to our kitchen or dining area.</p><p></p><p>A typical Filipino fridge is usually stocked with recycled plastic bottles in all sizes containing drinking water. In the same manner, we love buying hefty glass jars of instant coffee or peanut butter because they can be reused as drinking glasses.</p><p></p><p>Well, it’s all fun and games until someone gets hurt (or dies!) of either cancer from the chemicals leaching off the overused plastic bottles, or food poisoning from the ancient containers getting contaminated with a sundry of condiments and other substances that haven’t been washed off thoroughly.</p><p>2Speaking of rice, there’s no doubt we Filipinos are a rice-eating people. We consider meals without rice to be mere snacks, and all a restaurant has to do to get our attention and money is to offer “unlimited rice.”</p><p></p><p>Despite knowing the horrible effects of excessive carb consumption on our health (see ‘diabetes,’ ‘obesity,’ and ‘just plain feeling sleepy most of the time’), we insist on having our favorite carbohydrate with practically everything.</p><p></p><p>Is our obsession with rice just another chapter from our nation’s multi-volume book, Making the Most of What’s in Front of You? Both my siblings could eat rice with nothing but ripe mangoes or bananas—I kid you not. But regardless of this addiction’s root cause—whether biological, social, or cultural—this is one “Unli-“ offer that wouldn’t hurt our country if it expired</p><br />
