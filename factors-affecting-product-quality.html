                        1) Our POC (B) is responsible for tracking attendance and cascading updates. POC is <strong>singular</strong>.The uncontracted sentence becomes "proofs of concept" when we pluralize it, and this time the "s" is in the center rather than at the conclusion. So the plural is POCs, like ATMs.<p></p>2) Both teams were able to meet this month's QA and productivity targets.Here, "were" is the appropriate auxiliary verb.Teams are <strong>plural</strong>.When a collective noun, such as team, family, class, group, or host, acts collectively, a singular verb is used; when its constituent parts act separately, a plural verb is used.<p></p>3) Customers (A) prefer to speak with representatives who sound friendly and are willing to help.In the exercise, we must select the appropriate verb form from the provided list.A plural noun serves as the sentence's subject. Thus, a verb in the plural should come after it.The word "prefer" is <strong>plural</strong>. So, it is put to use.Without an auxiliary verb, the word "preferring" cannot be used, and the sentence lacks one.<p></p>4) My teammates and supervisor (B ) discuss factors that affect our quality scores during our team meetings. Discuss. The verb "discuss" is in the third person <strong>plural</strong> because there are multiple people engaged in the act of discussion.<p></p><p><strong>Learn more about singular and plural here: https://brainly.ph/question/71593</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><p></p><br />
