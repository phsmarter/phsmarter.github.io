                                            dections: Using the following opinions of Japanese about the Philippines, create an essay comparing your own opinion about it. An example is given below. Own Opinion: The Filipinos are very good English speakers. The Philippines has beautiful beaches. Own Opinion I think not all Filipinos are good at speaking in English. Some of them find it hard to read or even comprehend the English language. Moreover, some have difficulty uttering English words fluently. On the other hand, the Philippines have great beaches which are good to spend vacations with to relax and enjoy the summer breeze. Not only one place here has scenic places but every province or city has an ocean which can represent the beauty of it. Begin Here: Opinion 1. They open the door when you get in the cab which is very difficult for a Japanese person to do. 2. Filipinos sing a lot while they are working, and they are very good singers. 3. Filipinos are cheerful and friendly. 4. Women in the Philippines are energetic and can do a lot of things. 5. Fruits in the Philippines are delicious.​</a>

                                            Activity 2 Directions: Determine whether each opinion statement is supported by evidence or not. Put a check on the blank (✔) if there is evidence and cross (X) if not. If you put a check, underline the part of the statement that supports the opinion. Example: Students graduating from Senior High School are not ready for college or for work. Data from JobStreet.com reveal that as much as 35% were flatly unwilling to hire SHS graduates, while 41% were unsure of it. ✓ 1. Many Filipino students cannot write well, especially in English. They often have errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 2. An article by the think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) on Monday, April 20, said SHS difficulty in writing in English was particularly evident in research projects. 3. Most students have big problems in using different punctuation marks. The learning and teaching report showed that incorrect punctuation caused the most problems for students in conveying meaning in their essay writing (Department of Student Services, 2013, p. 23). 4. To convey meaning, students must punctuate their work correctly. This is very important in writing. Students should always remember this. 5. I believe that the current curriculum in English is not working well for the Filipino learners. Instead of helping them improve their English skills, they are becoming worse. need help po:(​</a>

                        <p><strong>Essay</strong> is a short piece of writing that is written formally.  We write ESSAYS to <strong>express and share our ideas</strong>. It is only written shortly and<strong> briefly</strong> about a certain subject.
</p><p>THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SHORT ESSAY (excerpt) by Feross Aboukhadijeh, 11th grade
</p><p>Success: The Myth
</p><p>Do you know someone rich and famous? Is he confident, popular, and joyful all of the time—the epitome of mainstream success? Or, on the other hand, is he stressed, having second thoughts about his life choices, and unsure about the meaning of his life? I am willing to be that it is the second one. Mainstream marketing and media have effectively brainwashed our society into accepting a false, even potentially dangerous definition of success. Marketers want us to believe that having lots of money, living in a big house, and owning all of the latest cars, fashions, and technology is the key to happiness, and hence, success. This overstated, falsely advertised myth is hardly ever the case in real life. True success requires respect, appreciation, integrity, and patience—all of which are traits that by human nature are genuinely difficult to attain—especially in the face of modern marketers who relentlessly deceive us, control our thoughts, and usurp our independence in order to increase their bottom line.
</p><p>Marketers want us to believe that living a selfish life, involving nothing but the pursuit of money and fame will bring success and happiness. Sadly, this is not true. Money is comparable to the often-mentioned new toy—fun while it is brand new and fresh, but terribly boring and unexciting after a few hours of play. Though money can buy conveniences and comforts, one needs much more than superficial luxuries to live a successful, well-balanced life. Money does make life easier—but it does not necessarily make it better. For example, money can not make one knowledgeable or wise – that only comes with hard work and committed study. And money can not help one forge a long-term relationship with husband or wife – that only comes through love, commitment, and sacrifice. All the money in the world cannot teach respect or courtesy – that only comes with a good up-bringing and a strong concern for the feelings of others. Can money give one the gift of patience or leadership or appreciation or courage or friendship or even generosity? I don’t think so. All of these traits—knowledge, wisdom, love, respect, patience—are essential aspects of a successful person’s life. Money cannot assist in the attainment of any of these vital traits! Money merely detracts from the pursuit of success by providing distraction, temptation, and corruption. Therefore the marketer’s illegitimate claim that money is tantamount to success can be easily disproved. There is no elevator to success – you have to take the stairs.
</p><p>When a person allows his mind to be restrained by mainstream television, magazines, and the internet, becoming successful is an impossible task. Fortunately, there is a way to stop this disgraceful masquerade before all Americans end up deprived of their wool—or worse—sent to the slaughterhouse. In order to return to the traditional definition of success, Americans must cast off the lifestyle that they have been force-fed and build a better one! Rather than using money and popularity as the method to achieve the ever-so elusive success, Americans should seek simpler, more effective solutions that might not be obvious at first glance. Ralph Waldo Emerson gave priceless insight when he wrote:
</p><p>
</p><p>To laugh often and much;
</p><p>
</p><p>To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
</p><p>
</p><p>To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
</p><p>
</p><p>To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others;
</p><p>
</p><p>To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition;
</p><p>
</p><p>To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is to have succeeded.
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point, a reader may be thinking “Wow! It takes all that to be truly successful? Maybe I’m not meant to be successful.” or “This ‘success’ thing is just too much work. Is it worth it?” Well, to answer these questions in brief: yes. It is not easy to become successful and hardly anyone is truly successful – but it is a noble goal to strive for. Just like everything else in life, becoming successful takes practice; no one becomes a success overnight. <strong>With courage and hope</strong> our society can forget the marketer’s inadequate definition of success and work to attain true success by modeling respect, appreciation, integrity, and patience – the keys to happiness and success.

Own Opinion: The Filipinos are very good English speakers. The Philippines has beautiful beaches. Own Opinion I think not all Filipinos are good at speaking in English. Some of them find it hard to read or even comprehend the English language. Moreover, some have difficulty uttering English words fluently. On the other hand, the Philippines have great beaches which are good to spend vacations with to relax and enjoy the summer breeze. Not only one place here has scenic places but every province or city has an ocean which can represent the beauty of it. Begin Here: Opinion 1. They open the door when you get in the cab which is very difficult for a Japanese person to do. 2. Filipinos sing a lot while they are working, and they are very good singers. 3. Filipinos are cheerful and friendly. 4. Women in the Philippines are energetic and can do a lot of things. 5. Fruits in the Philippines are delicious.​</h2><br />

                            6. Activity 2 Directions: Determine whether each opinion statement is supported by evidence or not. Put a check on the blank (✔) if there is evidence and cross (X) if not. If you put a check, underline the part of the statement that supports the opinion. Example: Students graduating from Senior High School are not ready for college or for work. Data from JobStreet.com reveal that as much as 35% were flatly unwilling to hire SHS graduates, while 41% were unsure of it. ✓ 1. Many Filipino students cannot write well, especially in English. They often have errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 2. An article by the think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) on Monday, April 20, said SHS difficulty in writing in English was particularly evident in research projects. 3. Most students have big problems in using different punctuation marks. The learning and teaching report showed that incorrect punctuation caused the most problems for students in conveying meaning in their essay writing (Department of Student Services, 2013, p. 23). 4. To convey meaning, students must punctuate their work correctly. This is very important in writing. Students should always remember this. 5. I believe that the current curriculum in English is not working well for the Filipino learners. Instead of helping them improve their English skills, they are becoming worse. need help po:(​</h2><br />

                        <p>Attention Grabber: Have you ever wondered what it would be like if all the ancient literatures were shredded? The Library of Congress has decided to shred some of the most famous epic literatures that have been published long ago. As an activist on the board of PAC (Protect Ancient Civilizations), I strongly believe that these literatures should be saved.</p><p></p><p>Focus: The Library of Congress is a place where ancient literatures are kept safe for future generations to read and learn from. However, the decision to shred some of the most famous epic literatures is a grave mistake. These literatures are not just words on a page, but they are a representation of the culture and history of our ancestors. Destroying them would be like erasing a part of our past.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Evidence and Examples: One of the most famous epic literatures that is at risk of being shredded is the Epic of Gilgamesh. This literature is considered one of the earliest surviving works of literature and is a representation of the Mesopo.tamiam culture. It tells the story of a king who goes on a journey to find eternal life and is a reflection of the human desire for immortality. Another literature that is at risk is the Iliad, which is an ancient Greek epic poem that tells the story of the Trojan War. This literature is a representation of the Greek culture and is a reflection of their values and beliefs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Grammar: It is important to preserve these literatures for future generations to read and learn from. Destroying them would be a great loss to our society. We should not let these literatures be shredded and forgotten. Instead, we should cherish them and pass them down to future generations.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Audience: The Library of Congress is a place where ancient literatures are kept safe for future generations to read and learn from. As an activist on the board of PAC (Protect Ancient Civilizations), I urge the members of the Library of Congress to reconsider their decision to shred these literatures. These literatures are not just words on a page, but they are a representation of our culture and history. We should not let them be destroyed.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sample of informative essay</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>James Baldwin said it best. "I met a lot of people in Europe. I even encountered myself" (Baldwin, 2014). Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today.
</p><p>
</p><p>The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they stand still on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local.
</p><p>
</p><p>Also in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel, but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath.
</p><p>
</p><p>In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, "I never travel with friends. When I'm exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick" (Byrnes, 2018).
</p><p>
</p><p>This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, "We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We focus on work, family, to-do lists, chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all" (Byrnes, 2018).
</p><p>
</p><p>Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable on the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.</p><br />

                            22. example of essay about pandemic English ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I had a dream come true last weekend, quite literally. For the first time in about six months, I was able to browse in a bookstore (one in my neighborhood that's reopened with sanitary and social distancing protocols clearly posted) while wide-awake. In the past, leaving the store without buying anything had felt like a triumph of willpower, but this time it involved some guilt. Only one other person was in the store during my visit, a clerk, and it only seemed fair to her to purchase something. Next time, for sure.</p><p></p><p>To be clear, I am not exactly wanting for reading material, but the element of wish fulfillment is intense even so. Likewise with my spouse, who reports having theater dreams. She has attended at least one play a week, on the most conservative estimate, throughout her entire adult life -- or did until this spring. Performances by excellent companies are livestreamed now, and she has been able to take theater classes online. But there’s more to going to theater than seeing a play -- a ritual-like aspect that can’t be broadcast. Browsing indulges curiosity and involves a degree of chance. The hunger is not for content but for certain qualities of experience, in part communal, that are lost or on hold for the duration.</p><p></p><p>The possibility of turning crisis into opportunity comes up in one of the essays on working from home that appears in the latest issue of the Journal of Scholarly Publishing. “How many of you,” asks Erika Dyck, a history professor at the University of Saskatchewan, “have dreamed of pressing pause on the work treadmill? I am talking about a genuine freeze-frame, reset, and rethink, or a chance to read something that isn’t directly related to a task with a deadline.”</p><p></p><p>But think again: “Let’s not kid ourselves; working from home during a pandemic is not that.” Before the pandemic, Dyck had what seemed like a modus vivendi that balanced parental responsibilities and academic work, including her role as a co-editor of the Canadian Bulletin for Medical History. “Now,” she writes, “despite being relatively isolated or even hiding in a home office, I consistently feel tired and am unable to focus on anything, especially when it comes to writing … My mind has constantly wandered, whether drifting toward the contents of the fridge and the looming prospect of dinner, or more often enveloping me in a fog of wondering whether any of the work we do as academics really matters, or whether we will still have academic institutions in a post-COVID world.”</p><p></p><p>Dyck’s is the most confessional of the essays and, no doubt for that reason, the one that made the most impression on me. At some point her trouble writing it became integral to what she had to say -- in particular, to acknowledging the trouble with “feeling like we need to be productive while people are dying, losing jobs, hungry and scared.”</p><p></p><p>The other four contributors to “A Compilation of Short Takes on Working from Home” recount different levels of difficulty in adjusting to the disruption. Bryan Birchmeier, an intellectual property coordinator at Michigan Publishing and the University of Michigan Press, frames it as a less physically grueling version of the phase known as “tear-down” or “total control” that he went through as in boot camp: “It’s meant to break down any barriers recruits may have to adjusting to a military schedule and to military procedures … We have had to create or adjust to a new schedule and new procedures because so much about our daily routine is different …”</p><p></p><p>At the other extreme is the experience of Olivier Lebert, the manager for two Canadian journals for 15 years, who has telecommuted for 11 of them -- and from France for the past 10. It sounds like the pandemic has not called for that much change in routine, and he can sum up best practices very clearly: establish a schedule. Stick to it. Meet deadlines. Outside your set working hours, relax: “stop responding to professional calls or emails.”</p><p></p><p>Lebert’s recommendations are sensible, and they line up closely with the advice offered in the same symposium by Sarah Buhler, an associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law, and by Kathie Porta Baker, described as “a self-employed manuscript editor, proofreader, and production assistant living and working in Northern Virginia.” But for Lebert, the boot camp-like transformation took place quite a while ago. Work at home has become second nature, though he does not indicate how long that took.</p><p></p><p>We are coming up on six months since the familiar broke. Marking the anniversary of a change sometimes helps to put it in perspective. In this case no commonly accepted date is available to punctuate time into before and after. (March 10 seems a little early, while March 15 is probably too late.) The turn was sudden, sharp, yet a blur. We make adjustments that seem to nudge things a little closer to normal, but with an uneasy awareness that there is so much more loss still to come.</p><p></p><p><strong>P</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>k</strong><strong> </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope it helps.</p><br />
