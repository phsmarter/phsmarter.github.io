Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano? Why? You may present your answer in creative way, e.g., using infographic, slogan, poster, 4-linepoem, essay, 4-line song or any presentation at your preference.Rubric5 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts and has no misconception.4 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts but with misconception.3 - Ideas are expressed scientifically but contains several contradictory concepts.2 - Ideas are poorly expressed scientifically.1 - Ideas are vague and unprecise.Note: Score is multiplied by 2Need ko po talaga please help me!​</a>
