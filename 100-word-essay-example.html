It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</a>

AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reincarnation is the belief that a person’s soul is reborn into a new physical body after death. One example of reincarnation is the Hindu belief in samsara, the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. In this cycle, the soul is born again and again, each time in a different body. The soul is said to be reborn with the same personality and memories, but in a different physical form. This cycle of rebirth is believed to continue until the soul has reached a state of enlightenment and is released from the cycle of reincarnation. Other examples of reincarnation are found in many religions and spiritual traditions, such as Buddhism, Jainism, and various New Age and Pagan beliefs.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I believe in reincarnation. To me, this is a fascinating concept that allows us to explore the idea of life after death. It suggests that our souls can be reborn into a new life, and that our experiences in this life can shape our future lives. This allows us to learn from our mistakes and create a better future for ourselves. It also offers a sense of hope, as we can strive to improve ourselves and our lives in order to achieve a better outcome in our next life. Ultimately, I believe that reincarnation is a powerful and inspiring concept that can help us to make the most of our lives.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>its in our opinion when it comes in reincarnation </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The words “Charleston”, “Stutz Bearcat”, and “Raccoon Coat” date back to the 1920s, when young males sought to re-establish themselves in their culture through fashionable dress codes, expensive cars, and excellent dancing skills. Nothing has changed since then: raccoon coats are no longer fashionable, but trends and fads continue to dominate the hearts and minds of people, giving them a false sense of belonging to a privileged class.</p><p></p><p>In Shulman’s story, as well as in the real world, a raccoon coat used to be a symbol of style and privilege among male college students. For Petey Bellows, the author’s roommate, a raccoon coat is a matter of life vs. death: he wants a raccoon coat above anything in the world. He knows that to have a raccoon coat means to “be in the swim” (Shulman).</p><p></p><p>Petey believes that there is no way for him to outperform his peers other than to own a piece of fashionable clothes. He does not realize that being “in the swim” is the same as being lost in a gray crowd of people. That raccoon coats are unsanitary and weight too much means nothing to Petey (Shulman). He treats clothes as the sign of his privileged position and personal well being.</p><p></p><p>In the 1920s, the revival of raccoon coats was accompanied by the returning popularity of Charleston, which rapidly grew into a social mania. Charleston was inseparable from fashion. Those who did not follow the trend would doom themselves to social oblivion, isolation, and even rejection. At that time, a young student wearing a raccoon coat and dancing Charleston would be a secret dream for dozens of girls. Undoubtedly, a fashionable car added to the picture of personal prosperity.</p><p></p><p>Stutz Bearcat was one of the most fashionable cars in the 1920s.Shulman recalls how his father used to wear his raccoon coat “in his Stutz Bearcat in 1925”. The car carried a deep, complex social meaning. It was a symbol of prosperity, a sign of privilege, and a symptom of wealth and fashion.</p><p></p><p>Shulman suggests that, back in his college years, his father used to be extremely fashionable. Simultaneously, the author is absolutely indifferent to these things. He tries to show that clothes, cars, and dancing skills have nothing to with personal uniqueness. Unfortunately, he fails to recognize the significance of these social codes, until his girl leaves to Petey, who wears a raccoon coat.Nothing has changed since then. Raccoon coats are no longer fashionable, but trends and fads continue to dominate people’s hearts and minds. Ferraris, personal airplanes, Armani clothes and fashionable after-parties create an image of enormous material wealth. Like many years before, these items symbolize a social privilege but tell nothing about individuality and uniqueness.</p><p></p><p>The media spread the message of materialism, turning money into a self-goal. Inanimate objects replace individuality and uniqueness. They give a false sense of belonging to a privileged class but leave little room for personal development and growth</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Trends and fads come and go, but their social significance is difficult to underestimate. In the 1920s, raccoon coats, Stutz Bearcats and Charleston were the symbols of a privileged social position. Thousands of male college students would do anything to wear fashionable clothes and develop unique dancing skills; otherwise, they would doom themselves to oblivion, isolation, and social rejection.</p><p></p><p>Nothing has changed since then: raccoon coats are no longer fashionable, but trends and fads continue to dominate people’s hearts and minds.

Unfortunately, they have nothing to do with individuality, uniqueness, self-development, and personal growth.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps.</p><p></p><br />

                            12. Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</h2><br />

A graphical representation of music allows computers to create and understand sounds.

AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research is useful in everyday life because it provides information that allows you to make educated judgments. People in a community, for example, are all getting sick with the same illness, as demonstrated by the same symptoms. We need to figure out what's causing the illness, how to treat it, and how to keep additional people from becoming ill. We can speculate about the cause: it could be evil spirits attacking those who practice black magic, a poisoning of the water supply, or a contagious disease that will run its course—but how do we stop it?</p><p>Research can assist narrow down the alternatives, find the most effective treatment, and rule out what it isn't. Medicines are created through study, trial &amp; error, and testing. Research informs us about what has occurred in the past and assists us in predicting what may occur in the future.</p><br />
