                                            Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment 10 minutes You have made decisions in the past and will be making still in the coming days, weeks or months. To be better on this, you may want to look back and reflect how you were doing it and be mindful on the learnings that those experiences try to mold in you. Did you have a moment of evaluating your decisions in the past? If so, how did you do it? Here are some pointers for you to make sense out of your past decisions: 1. Did you get the rightful results? Did it really solve your problem? If you answered "yes" to these questions, that's good. If "no", why did you say so? Did your solution create more problems or complications? If that's the case, then, you may take it as a learning experience. Maybe in your next decisions, you can check if your option will really answer the problem or it will create more. If it does, then, it certainly is not the right solution. You could consider other options next time and eliminate the choice that brought you more problems. 2. What were the consequences when you made that decision? What took place after your decision? Did it improve the situation? Did you feel good about it? Decision-making comes with responsibility. It is very ideal for any decision to be favorable for everyone. However, there are times that you need to calculate the risk of your choice. Hence, it has to be a well-calculated one. You are responsible for any decisions that you make. Good or bad, you have to own it. Be wiser with it. 3. Did it contribute to your personal growth in any areas of life (social relationship, academic performance, career pathing, health, spiritual, etc.) With your past decisions, can you identify any significant changes in your life in any aspect of it? For instance, when you decided to continue your studies during this pandemic, did it make a step nearer to your dream of finishing basic education? When you decided to stay at home instead of going out with your friends, did it make any difference to your safety? Try to appreciate whatever gains or personal development you have for any choice that you have. It is a good point of reference for your succeeding decision-making in life. 4. Did it consider the common good? In your past decisions, did it promote the welfare of everyone around you or there are regrets attached to it? There might be times when you are clouded by your personal biases or perceptions. However, the common good would always be a good consideration when weighing your options. At times, there is a need to analyze what is good for you and for everyone. Always try to check what would be good and gain for everyone. Your maturity and experiences aid you to always prioritize the common good. 5. How would that make you as a person?​</a>

Study reveals internet can ruin family relationships
Can the Internet be a source of conflicts? A new study from online security firm says yes, and it does not just affect intimate relationships but family relationships as well.
Previous researches have revealed that children on average spend six hours or more glued to the screens of their devices.
Kaspersky Lab and iconKids &amp; Youth researchers surveyed over 3,700 families in seven countries to know about how the internet is affecting their personal relationship with their children.
One in four of the parents surveyed say that their kids now prefer to go online rather than talk to them, with one in three parents believing the internet isolates them from their children. All in all, a fifth of parents and children say that the internet can cause family tension.
"It is only natural that using—and misusing—each other’s connected devices can become a cause of conflict for families. However, as we spend more and more time online, family dynamics are also changing. It is important that families maintain an ongoing dialogue about how to spot and respond to potential dangers, with parents and children together agreeing on the basic rules on how they can best navigate the digital world,” said Andrei Mochola, head of consumer business at Kaspersky Lab.
The survey also reveals that the problem may be worsened in the following cases:
If the device used by both parents and children gets broken,
If the device is accidentally infected by a virus while online,
If the parents had to pay for something their child had ordered or downloaded, and
If the parents had accidentally deleted some of their children's data
Janice Richardson, senior advisor at European Schoolnet, said that although the internet becomes a source of conflict in some families, siblings and extended family members take on a much bigger role in children's online activities.
"Children are instinctively turning to the person they perceive to be able to fix technical issues, advise on sites and security tools and provide more objective responses to delicate queries,” Richardson said, citing a recent study by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission.
She said that given the emerging trend, the importance of parents and guardians developing their own technical competence and building trusting relationship with their kids grow.
"At the same time, software and social media providers, too, should seek to develop more ‘family-friendly’ tools,” Richardson added. — Alixandra Caole Vila</a>

Basic Interpretative Qualitative Study- This is used when a researcher is interested in identifying how individuals give meaning to a situation or problem. 5. Case Study- It is an in-depth examination of an individual, groups of people, or an institution. It provides information on where to draw conclusions about the impact of a significant event in one's life.

                            7. Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment 10 minutes You have made decisions in the past and will be making still in the coming days, weeks or months. To be better on this, you may want to look back and reflect how you were doing it and be mindful on the learnings that those experiences try to mold in you. Did you have a moment of evaluating your decisions in the past? If so, how did you do it? Here are some pointers for you to make sense out of your past decisions: 1. Did you get the rightful results? Did it really solve your problem? If you answered "yes" to these questions, that's good. If "no", why did you say so? Did your solution create more problems or complications? If that's the case, then, you may take it as a learning experience. Maybe in your next decisions, you can check if your option will really answer the problem or it will create more. If it does, then, it certainly is not the right solution. You could consider other options next time and eliminate the choice that brought you more problems. 2. What were the consequences when you made that decision? What took place after your decision? Did it improve the situation? Did you feel good about it? Decision-making comes with responsibility. It is very ideal for any decision to be favorable for everyone. However, there are times that you need to calculate the risk of your choice. Hence, it has to be a well-calculated one. You are responsible for any decisions that you make. Good or bad, you have to own it. Be wiser with it. 3. Did it contribute to your personal growth in any areas of life (social relationship, academic performance, career pathing, health, spiritual, etc.) With your past decisions, can you identify any significant changes in your life in any aspect of it? For instance, when you decided to continue your studies during this pandemic, did it make a step nearer to your dream of finishing basic education? When you decided to stay at home instead of going out with your friends, did it make any difference to your safety? Try to appreciate whatever gains or personal development you have for any choice that you have. It is a good point of reference for your succeeding decision-making in life. 4. Did it consider the common good? In your past decisions, did it promote the welfare of everyone around you or there are regrets attached to it? There might be times when you are clouded by your personal biases or perceptions. However, the common good would always be a good consideration when weighing your options. At times, there is a need to analyze what is good for you and for everyone. Always try to check what would be good and gain for everyone. Your maturity and experiences aid you to always prioritize the common good. 5. How would that make you as a person?​</h2><br />

Study reveals internet can ruin family relationships
Can the Internet be a source of conflicts? A new study from online security firm says yes, and it does not just affect intimate relationships but family relationships as well.
Previous researches have revealed that children on average spend six hours or more glued to the screens of their devices.
Kaspersky Lab and iconKids &amp; Youth researchers surveyed over 3,700 families in seven countries to know about how the internet is affecting their personal relationship with their children.
One in four of the parents surveyed say that their kids now prefer to go online rather than talk to them, with one in three parents believing the internet isolates them from their children. All in all, a fifth of parents and children say that the internet can cause family tension.
"It is only natural that using—and misusing—each other’s connected devices can become a cause of conflict for families. However, as we spend more and more time online, family dynamics are also changing. It is important that families maintain an ongoing dialogue about how to spot and respond to potential dangers, with parents and children together agreeing on the basic rules on how they can best navigate the digital world,” said Andrei Mochola, head of consumer business at Kaspersky Lab.
The survey also reveals that the problem may be worsened in the following cases:
If the device used by both parents and children gets broken,
If the device is accidentally infected by a virus while online,
If the parents had to pay for something their child had ordered or downloaded, and
If the parents had accidentally deleted some of their children's data
Janice Richardson, senior advisor at European Schoolnet, said that although the internet becomes a source of conflict in some families, siblings and extended family members take on a much bigger role in children's online activities.
"Children are instinctively turning to the person they perceive to be able to fix technical issues, advise on sites and security tools and provide more objective responses to delicate queries,” Richardson said, citing a recent study by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission.
She said that given the emerging trend, the importance of parents and guardians developing their own technical competence and building trusting relationship with their kids grow.
"At the same time, software and social media providers, too, should seek to develop more ‘family-friendly’ tools,” Richardson added. — Alixandra Caole Vila</h2><br />
