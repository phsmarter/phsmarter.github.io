                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

                            17. The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

                            28. LiteratureAnswer the following questions 1. On the poem, APO ON THE WALL, identify and discuss two values that the persona's father wanted to teach his child, specifically, about what it means to be a man.2. On LENGUA PARA DIABLO, What does it tell us about the current Philippine society? Discuss this in reference to our level of poverty, unemployment rate and quality of education today​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Apo on the wall by Bj Patino is a poem that talks about the narration of a child’s point of view about his rigorous Father and the hanging photo around the wall called “Apo”. The poem tells the reality of life during the reigning of Marcos alongside with the Martial Law. It is a reflection of the scenario of what and how the Filipinos experienced the tragic and traumatic event throughout the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. “Apo on the wall” shows the real situation concerning with the different perspective between millennial and those who lived through Martial law. This masterpiece of Bj Patino advocates reasonably close to the realization of giving importance on looking back to our past, moving forward through our present and ensuring the success of our future.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. In our culture father is considered the “haligi ng tahanan”, they are the face of the family. The father reflects what kind of family you are into. They are the role models of the family. What if a father loses his able to speak for himself?</p><p></p><p>The story shows how unemployment and poverty greatly affects the situation of the family, particularly if the father is the one that is unemployed. The father in the story lost his pride and ability to speak for himself. He lost it all due to the reason that he has no work and no longer can support and contribute to his family financially. He has no more confidence to share his own views and opinions and looked down by his’ own children.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The story said “The devil ate his words” he doesn’t more gain respect from his kids, no more pride and especially his dignity was lost. The situation is truly happening now in the society. This usually happens to young family that is caused by early pregnancy for they don’t have enough proper knowledge and education. These situations are really present to our community. The situation is really difficult to the father because he needs to sacrifice all of his pride and ego to stay home and monitor to their kids. There are many possibilities that may happen the father may have another affair or may use drugs of abuse. Not just that the kids may mock their fathers and be ashamed of them for they are not earning. This is really disheartening from the father’s side. That is why proper education and guidance of the family is really important. So that we won’t have these kinds of situations in our society for the main reason of this is LACK OF EDUCATION!</p><br />

                            29. The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

                            30. What do you think are the cause of poverty? can this be traced to poor quality of Philippine Education?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This is very opinion based so I'll answer to what I believe in.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The main cause of poverty is corruption and the inability of the government to provide necessary resources for the populace. Without proper funding to essential establishments such as education, research, and social welfare, the society will not develop.  It can definitely trace back to the poor quality of education ever since as people still are not educated enough to elect government officials that truly works for the people and not for their own gain.</p><br />
