Is it helping others all of the time and not caring for yourself or Vic versa; being very selfish and having no remorse for others?</p><p>I think there are subjective things that each individual person will have, but I also think there are certain objective things that everyone should have.</p><p>The first thing should be your health. If you are not healthy and taking care of your body everyday, you are on board for a trip to the bottom because as your body degrades, as you get older, all of the unhealthy foods you have been eating and the months you have been putting off the gym will come back to haunt you. Eating healthy and working out is like cheap health insurance that adds up over time. Why wouldn’t you want to take advantage of that? And you see a lot of business people or people in general who work their butts off for money but they get a disease that ruins their quality of life.</p><p>There is this saying when people are younger, they use their health to get wealth and when they are older, they use their wealth to get back their health. It’s a circular logic and circular is illogical in this case.</p><p>And this isn’t just my opinion, there is amazing science to back this up. Weight lifting reverses the age of your telomeres, aerobic exercises help your brain function better, and etc. Even if you don’t have access to a gym, you can always run around your street.</p><p>The second thing you should have is money. Not just to tally it up, but just enough money to tell yourself,” I am financially independent”. You bread people who say ,”Money is the root of all evil”, but I don’t want to say that in a mean way, but money isn’t the root of all evil. Yes to a certain extent, I can see why people would say money is the root of all evil, but the lack of money should be the root of all evil. Just look at rich and poor countries.</p><p></p>ANSWERED BY: HuYiTian94<br />

                            15. How free are you? Write an essay on how you see freedom in your life. what areas in your life shows that you have freedom​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Freedom is having the right to be me and express myself. With the freedom our veterans have fought for, we really get to be ourselves.</p><p>Freedom lets us talk how we want and explain about yourself to be how you want yourself. You can protest for what you believe is right and even if it's wrong you are able to express it.</p><p>You can have a religion to follow what you believe in, not what you are forced to believe in. Not being afraid to say what you believe, because nothing bad will happen to you.</p><p>If you do, it’s not a secret, is another great freedom we have.</p><p>I also get to write how I want and about what I want to write about. The freedom of press. I can write fun or serious stories however I want to. Then I can share them and don't have to hide them like in some other countries.</p><p>Another great freedom here is getting to go to school. In other countries, kids don't get to go to school, let alone girls. I learn a lot at school and it’s where I become myself the most. Without this freedom we would all be more alike, and not be able to be ourselves.</p><p>Every morning I wake up, not having fears of whether or not I’ll live that day. I’m confident to act as my normal self. I have no fear of this because our future, present, and past men and women have fought to keep us safe. Not in the middle of wars and not worried for our lives. Allowing us to confidently live our day.</p><p>It is all of these things that make us who we are, and with the freedom we have fought for, we really can be ourselves. So freedom might just be a word in the dictionary, but to me, freedom is getting to be one-hundred percent me.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I'm not sure po, cinopy ko lang kase correct me if I'm wrong（＾ｖ＾）</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The scientific method attempts to minimize the influence of bias or prejudice in the experimenter. Even the best-intentioned scientists can't escape bias. It results from personal beliefs, as well as cultural beliefs, which means any human filters information based on his or her own experience. Unfortunately, this filtering process can cause a scientist to prefer one outcome over another. For someone trying to solve a problem around the house, succumbing to these kinds of biases is not such a big deal. But in the scientific community, where results have to be reviewed and duplicated, bias must be avoided at all costs.</p><br />

 your lifetime some people will discredit you, disrespect you and treat 
you poorly for no apparent reason at all. Don’t consume yourself with 
trying to change them or win their approval. And don’t make any space in
 your heart to hate them. Simply walk away and let GOD deal with the 
things they do, because any bit of time you spend on them will be 
wasted, and any bit of hate and aggravation in your heart will only hurt
 you.<br /><br />

                            23. for you, what are the things that microscope can contribute to our life?(essay)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>microscope is an instrument that is used to magnify small objects. Some microscopes can even be used to observe an object at the cellular level, allowing scientists to see the shape of a cell, its nucleus, mitochondria, and other organelles. While the modern microscope has many parts, the most important pieces are its lenses. It is through the microscope’s lenses that the image of an object can be magnified and observed in detail. A simple light microscope manipulates how light enters the eye using a convex lens, where both sides of the lens are curved outwards. When light reflects off of an object being viewed under the microscope and passes through the lens, it bends towards the eye. This makes the object look bigger than it actually is.<p></p>Over the course of the microscope’s history, technological innovations have made the microscope easier to use and have improved the quality of the images produced. The compound microscope, which consists of at least two lenses, was invented in 1590 by Dutch spectacle-makers Zacharias and Hans Jansen. Some of the earliest microscopes were also made by a Dutchman named Antoine Van Leeuwenhoek. Leeuwenhoek’s microscopes consisted of a small glass ball set inside a metal frame. He became known for using his microscopes to observe freshwater, single-celled microorganisms that he called “animalcules.”<p></p>Though modern microscopes can be high-tech, microscopes have existed for centuries – this brass optical microscope dates to 1870, and was made in Munich, Germany. <p></p>microscope is an instrument that can be used to observe small objects, even cells. The image of an object is magnified through at least one lens in the microscope. This lens bends light toward the eye and makes an object appear larger than it actually is.<br />
