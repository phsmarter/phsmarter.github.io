Firstly; Thirdly ; In addition ; Thus ; Most importantly ; Because ; Secondly; Lastly; Actually ;At this point Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, teachers, parents, and my fellow students. Our today's occasion is an outstanding event for all of us as another academic year has come to an end. This means that another group of students graduate from our school and is to start its way into the 'adult life'. 1) ______, this 'adult life' seems to be less appealing and more terrifying with its close oncoming. 2) ____, there are a few important things I am eager to tell our graduates. 3) _____is: do not be afraid of the changes that come to your life; they are crucial, unpredictable, and overwhelming but you are able to deal with them. 4) ______, just built your own way and remember that your families and friends are always there to provide you with any needed support. 5). ______, please, keep in mind the fact that we are graduating after you and look up for you as the examples and inspirations, so, do not be up to anything you would not like us to do. I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness. Thank you and congratulations!​</a>

                                                 Okay, we're gonna have this huge exam and apparently, there's gonna be general knowledge included in this exam. I thought; "If it's just general knowledge then I probably won't have a problem. But if it's PHILIPPINE general knowledge, then my life's as good as over." Why, I don't even know who the Philippine presidents are except for the first, the current, and the one before the current. Hey, don't blame me! I've listened in Hekasi class time, but you know why I know so little about this particular subject? It's becuase Filipino, for me, is so hard!!! My Filipino fluency level is that of a 5th grader! And no, I'm not in the least but interested in becoming fluent; I just need enough words to survive.
     Anyway, other than the presidents, can any of you tell me what questions they usually ask in the general knowledge portion? Like WHEN did the (insert important event here) happen, or WHEN was (insert important person here) born and when did he/she die, or something like that? Please, please, be specific.
 
Note: I'm rewarding 25 points (as you can clearly see) for whoever answers my question SPECIFICALLY and CORRECTLY. And if you can't really answer, then just point me to a USEFUL and very INFORMATIVE website.
P.S.: I was too lazy to type in Google *Philippine General Knowledge* and choose from hundreds of websites then reading and memorizing tons of things which I'm really not interested in learning. And I just wanted to test what this website can actually do.

                                            write a story which relates the events of your life from past, present and future to the life cycle of a star. use also those elements which could symbolize something or anything in your story.THIS IS MY ANWERMaking our dreams a reality is quite impossible for those who dream. In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

Out of pity and curiosity, I went in front of him end asked him where were his children he answered "may kanya-kanya nang asawa". I frown in dismay and nodded. Upon hearing his answer, I've realized how ungrateful his children were. At that momen I promised myself to take care of my parents 'til the day they bid their farewell in this world. can't afford to see my parents in his situation. And I think, that's the least that I can do to pa them back. Life had been really hard to those people who are less fortunate. It seems like they'v been forgotten not only by their loved ones but the society. Now, I realized why my parent are working hard for us to send to school and have a better life because they've been ther and don't want us to be in that situation. Those less fortunate people deserve to experienc the best in life for they've been through enough. But, no one will help them but themselves They should be the one to act first and the rest will follow. For people like us, if we thought that we have the heaviest problems, think twice or thrice There were people out there who suffered a lot but are still fighting, and so us too. Take ever problem an opportunity to be stronger and be an inspiration to other people. Prompt Questions: 8. What was the most memorable part of your own experience? 7.

                                            Why is ECQ important? well ECQ is important because: 
The Enchanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) is one experience i can never forget. It strengthens the bond with my family especially with my siblings since I spent most of the time with them playing, watching and sometimes arguing with each other. It brought us closer to nature since we were taught how to plant and take care of them.
There are so many things we missed during the ECQ. We cannot go to church, we cannot go to the mall, we cannot dine in the restaurants, we cannot go out of town, we cannot celebrate events and birthdays and most of all, we cannot go to school. 
Inspite all of these, the ECQ taught us one great lesson, which is, whatever life brings, there is always God to bring a rainbow after every storm.</a>

Firstly; Thirdly ; In addition ; Thus ; Most importantly ; Because ; Secondly; Lastly; Actually ;At this point Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, teachers, parents, and my fellow students. Our today's occasion is an outstanding event for all of us as another academic year has come to an end. This means that another group of students graduate from our school and is to start its way into the 'adult life'. 1) ______, this 'adult life' seems to be less appealing and more terrifying with its close oncoming. 2) ____, there are a few important things I am eager to tell our graduates. 3) _____is: do not be afraid of the changes that come to your life; they are crucial, unpredictable, and overwhelming but you are able to deal with them. 4) ______, just built your own way and remember that your families and friends are always there to provide you with any needed support. 5). ______, please, keep in mind the fact that we are graduating after you and look up for you as the examples and inspirations, so, do not be up to anything you would not like us to do. I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness. Thank you and congratulations!​</h2><br />

                            8.      Okay, we're gonna have this huge exam and apparently, there's gonna be general knowledge included in this exam. I thought; "If it's just general knowledge then I probably won't have a problem. But if it's PHILIPPINE general knowledge, then my life's as good as over." Why, I don't even know who the Philippine presidents are except for the first, the current, and the one before the current. Hey, don't blame me! I've listened in Hekasi class time, but you know why I know so little about this particular subject? It's becuase Filipino, for me, is so hard!!! My Filipino fluency level is that of a 5th grader! And no, I'm not in the least but interested in becoming fluent; I just need enough words to survive.
     Anyway, other than the presidents, can any of you tell me what questions they usually ask in the general knowledge portion? Like WHEN did the (insert important event here) happen, or WHEN was (insert important person here) born and when did he/she die, or something like that? Please, please, be specific.
 
Note: I'm rewarding 25 points (as you can clearly see) for whoever answers my question SPECIFICALLY and CORRECTLY. And if you can't really answer, then just point me to a USEFUL and very INFORMATIVE website.
P.S.: I was too lazy to type in Google *Philippine General Knowledge* and choose from hundreds of websites then reading and memorizing tons of things which I'm really not interested in learning. And I just wanted to test what this website can actually do.

                        <br /><br />&gt; When did the Former 11th President, Ferdinand Marcos, declared Martial Law?<br /> <strong>- September 21, 1972</strong><br /><br />&gt; What were the (4) reasons why the Martial Law ended?<br /><strong> - Death of Benigno Aquino</strong><br /> <strong>- Snap Election </strong>(An election that is like a "surprise". Like even though it's supposed to be held like 4 years later, it's held right now)<br /><strong> -EDSA Revolution</strong><br /><strong> -Confetti Revolution</strong><br /><br />&gt; What were the (3) programs Diosdado Macapagal initiated in his term?<br /><br /> -<strong>MAPHILINDO</strong> ( Malaysia-Philippines-Indonesia) = these three countries would be helping each other in means of economy, and mostly the things that they will be needing.<br /><br /> -<strong>Pilipinismo</strong> ( Pagpapalaganap ng Wikang Filipino)= Every person before should speak only their language: Tagalog. Even road signs from english names were transformed to tagalog names like "Daang Bonifacio"<br /><br /><strong>-Agricultural Land Reform Code</strong>= It's objective is to impart land to the farmers<br /><br />&gt; Who is Former President, Gloria Arroyo's father?<br /><strong> - Diosdado Macapagal</strong><br /><br />&gt;What were the (2) strategies to make Ferdinand Marcos' term last longer?<br /><strong> - To change the form of government</strong><br /><strong> - To declare Martial Law</strong><br /><br />&gt;Who is the former president in the 100 pesos bill?<br /> - <strong>Manuel Roxas<br /></strong><br /><br /><br /><br />P.S I youre wondering why it's most likely full of Marcos, it's cause there was a report about that like yesterday. This is all I can give, soory! I forgot about the other information about the other presidents.<br /><br /><br /><br />

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune.
