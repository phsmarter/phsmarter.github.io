                            1. What is speech act in 250 words</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A speech act in linguistics and the philosophy of language is something expressed by an individual that not only presents information, but performs an action as well.[1] For example, the phrase "I would like the mashed potatoes, could you please pass them to me?" is considered a speech act as it expresses the speaker's desire to acquire the mashed potatoes, as well as presenting a request that someone pass the potatoes to them. According to Kent Bach, "almost any speech act is really the performance of several acts at once, distinguished by different aspects of the speaker's intention: there is the act of saying something, what one does in saying it, such as requesting or promising, and how one is trying to affect one's audience".[2] The contemporary use of the term goes back to J. L. Austin's development of performative utterances and his theory of locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts. Speech acts serve their function once they are said or communicated. These are commonly taken to include acts such as apologizing, promising, ordering, answering, requesting, complaining, warning, inviting, refusing, and congratulating.[3]

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I would like to talk about relationships, and the importance of them.</p><p></p><p>Relationships are an important part of our lives. They provide us with companionship, emotional support, and a sense of belonging. They can also help us develop self-confidence and emotional resilience.</p><p></p><p>We all have different kinds of relationships in our lives - family, friends, colleagues, partners. Each of these relationships has its own set of challenges and rewards. It’s important to nurture these relationships and to be open and honest with those closest to us.</p><p></p><p>When we are in healthy relationships, we are more likely to feel supported, respected and valued. We can share our feelings and experiences with those around us, and we can rely on them to be there for us when we need them.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, not all relationships are healthy. If a relationship becomes abusive, or if we feel neglected or taken for granted, it can cause us to feel isolated, anxious, or even depressed. In these cases, it is important to seek help and support, and to get out of the unhealthy situation as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of relationship we have, it’s important to remember that relationships are a two-way street. We all need to be willing to put in effort and to give and take, in order for the relationship to be successful.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, relationships are an important part of our lives, and we should always strive to keep them healthy and positive. Thank you for listening.</p><br />

                        I would like to talk about the importance of giving clear and concise instructions. Whether you are a teacher, a manager, or a parent, giving instructions is an essential part of effective communication. When you give clear and concise instructions, you can help your students, employees, or children to complete tasks more efficiently, avoid mistakes, and achieve better results.<br /><br />To give effective instructions, it is important to be specific and to break down complex tasks into smaller steps. Use simple language, and avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the person receiving the instructions. Make sure to clarify any questions or concerns the person may have before they begin the task.<br /><br />Clear instructions can also help to build trust and confidence in your leadership. When people understand what is expected of them, they are more likely to feel motivated and engaged in their work. They are also more likely to see you as a competent and trustworthy leader.<br /><br />In conclusion, giving clear and concise instructions is an essential part of effective communication. By taking the time to give clear instructions, you can help your students, employees, or children to complete tasks more efficiently, avoid mistakes, and achieve better results.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Every word spoken is couched in some kind of context. The relation of speech and context yields meaning. And the meaning is received in the hearer's context, so its effect on the hearer is shaped and energized by both speaker and hearer.</p><p></p><p>Language form and mode of delivery are the vehicles of ideas; the hearer's openness and intention affect the concepts communicated.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hello! </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Explanations are an integral part of communication and play a vital role in shaping our understanding of the world. Whether it is at work, school, or in our personal lives, the ability to effectively explain ideas and concepts is a critical skill that can help us succeed and thrive.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To make an explanation, one must begin by clearly understanding the topic being discussed. This means doing the necessary research, gathering all relevant information, and organizing it in a way that makes sense. It is also important to consider the audience and tailor the explanation to their level of understanding. One should avoid using technical jargon or complex language that may confuse the listener.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When making an explanation, it is also important to be concise and direct. Long-winded explanations can be overwhelming and may cause the listener to lose interest. It is better to focus on the most important points and provide examples or analogies to help illustrate the concept being discussed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In addition to being clear and concise, a good explanation should also be engaging and interactive. This can be achieved by asking questions, encouraging feedback, and incorporating visual aids such as diagrams or videos.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Finally, a good explanation should leave the listener with a clear understanding of the topic and, ideally, inspire them to continue learning and exploring. By taking the time to craft a well-thought-out explanation, we can share knowledge and ideas in a way that is both effective and engaging.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, making explanations is a fundamental skill that can have a significant impact on our personal and professional lives. By taking the time to understand our audience, being clear and concise, and engaging our listeners, we can make effective explanations that inspire learning and facilitate understanding. </p><br />

                        <p>Good morning and best wishes for all of us.</p><p></p><p>Let me introduce myself, my name is Rendy, a student of communication science. On this occasion I will deliver a speech with the theme of <strong>communication situations</strong>. Talking about communication, who doesn't know communication media? Communication media is getting closer to us today.</p><p></p><p>Communication is the main <strong>asset</strong> in an <strong>organization</strong>. With smooth communication like giving <strong>instructions</strong> and having the <strong>explanation</strong>, we can avoid suspicion and misunderstanding. An organization will not progress if the members in it are closed and we must be sure, communication can make an organization successful. Therefore, we need to keep it so that communication is always as expected.</p><p></p><p>To maintain <strong>continuity</strong>, it is necessary to have a <strong>commitment</strong> among each member to be open in various issues, especially those concerning the interests of our organization. It is not easy to keep communication running smoothly, but good efforts and intentions can be a motivation for us so that we can do it. There are many incidents out there that have a bad impact without intense communication. Various debates to insult each other have become "snacks" every day.</p><p></p><p>All of this has nothing but the cause of not being able to maintain communication by upholding <strong>close</strong> <strong>interaction</strong>. Let's increase our solidarity, in order to achieve a common vision and mission. Thus, our organization becomes a solid and compact container.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> the communication tools and how effective they are in the different communication situations:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/12702121</p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Teaching oral communication in schools is becoming more infrequent. The importance of oral communication should be no different than the necessity of math, reading, or writing. Oral communication by definition is communication by word of mouth. Children must be confident in their speaking abilities because many careers require this skill. Schools must reconsider how important it is to promote oral communication, examine why it has been limited in schools, and learn how to teach it more effectively. Oral communication skills are a necessity that every child will need as an adult.
</p><p>
</p><p>Oral communication is an important skill because it promotes leadership and confidence. When children are confident in their abilities they will succeed academically and socially. It is important for students to generate their own ideas using outside references in the community (Joseph and Efron, pg 5-6). Oftentimes some students have trouble making friends. If they can learn to be more confident in their speaking abilities they will be more likely to approach their peers. On the other hand, when students feel comfortable expressing their ideas in front of people they will most likely contribute more to class discussions. Teachers always have difficulty with getting their students to participate constructively, so if the teacher spends more time teaching their students how to talk and respond coherently children will be more likely to contribute.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong>Title: A beach Picnic</strong></p><p>jasmine, ali and two other friends decided to go on a picnic to a  </p><p></p><p>beach. They packed their bags and were quite excited. They  </p><p>reached the picnic spot and came across a small child who was  </p><p>crying. They went towards that which and asked him what he  </p><p>wanted. He was so young that he could barely explain anything. As  </p><p>we turned around to look for his parents the child suddenly  </p><p>disappeared. We asked people around if they had seen a child or  </p><p>his parents or someone else with him. No one had a clue. They  </p><p></p><p>were shocked to see the child disappear.</p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p>They looked around for some time but found no trace of the child.  </p><p>They were worried and surprised at the same time. The water was  </p><p></p><p>gleaming like sapphire and gentle waves touched their feet as they  </p><p></p><p>ran on the soft yellow sand. They spread a sheet on the sand and  </p><p>took out snacks and drinks. They then enjoyed playing frisbee  </p><p>when jasmine tried to catch it she came across a bottle within  </p><p></p><p>which she found a letter. She brought this to the notice of Ali and  </p><p> her other two friend. They opened the bottle and saw that the  </p><p></p><p>paper said "HELP", they looked around but nobody in trouble could  </p><p>be spotted. everyone was quite happy and enjoying their beach  </p><p></p><p>coast guard did not react and said that it could be a prank since  </p><p>nobody was in trouble. So next, they informed the nearest police  </p><p>about whatever had happened.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>The police came too the beach and first questioned the coast guard  </p><p>for being inattentive. Then they investigated the matter and  </p><p>concluded that it could be a case of kidnapping. They took the  </p><p>matter in their hands and investigated. We left the beach and  </p><p>returned to our home. A few days later we were informed by the  </p><p>police that the child was found with another family who took him  </p><p>away since he was alone and his parents were also found in a place  </p><p>near the beach where they were locked after being looted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>OR</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Phone Call</p><p></p><p></p><p>On October 4, we all were decorating our house to celebrate the  </p><p>most long waited festival, Diwali. My heart was filled with  </p><p>excitement to meet my father after a long gap of six years. But a  </p><p>call from the army headquarters left us stunned. It was my father  </p><p>over the phone who said the he would not be returning to us this  </p><p>Diwali because of some emergency in the borders. He sounded  </p><p>much tensed and hurriedly left the phone connected. I continued  </p><p>to ask him what was wrong and kept pleading him to try to come  </p><p>back to us soon put we got no reply from the other side. All i could    </p><p>hear was firing, bombing and people shouting. My heart started  </p><p>beating fast and i couldn't decide what i would say to mom and  </p><p></p><p>my younger sister, Yamini.</p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p>I rushed to my mother and as tears rolled down my eyes I tried to  </p><p>explain to her all that happened over the phone. Yamini was at the</p><p></p><p></p><p> neighbor's place playing with other children and we decided not  </p><p>to tell her anything. I switched on the TV and turned to a news  </p><p>channel to find that there was a mob attack at the army</p><p></p><p></p><p>headquarters and all the reporters said was they could hear  </p><p>constant firing and bombing with no clue of what was happening</p><p></p><p></p><p>inside. I could see the expression on my mother's face intensifying.  </p><p>She couldn't hold back her tears anymore. I decided that i couldn't be weak and cry at this moment because i was the only one who  </p><p>had to console mother and give her strength. I told her that father  </p><p>is a hero and he will come back safe.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>In this tough situation sitting back at home, all we could do was  </p><p></p><p>pray to God. We did the diwali puja and prayed to god to keep my  </p><p>father and all other members of their team safe. I remembered my  </p><p> grandmother telling me stories of war. Of lives sacrificed and  </p><p>families torn apart because of war, of children unable to feel the  </p><p>warmth of the love of a father who had to be on duty, to fight for  </p><p>freedom and the nation's independence. All those stories and the  </p><p></p><p>emotions  evoked and came back to me today. Little do people  </p><p>realize the sacrifice of soldiers who give their entire life to their  </p><p></p><p>nation. Today we feel safe in out homes only because of the  </p><p></p><p>constant dedication of these heroes.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>We somehow spent a few hours praying to god. Finally, the news  </p><p>channel confirmed the news that no loss of life was reported and  </p><p> all the attackers were killed. We took a sigh of relief. Sometime  </p><p>later we got a called from dad and he said that he was find and  </p><p></p><p>admitted to the hospital due o some injuries. He also said that as  </p><p>soon as he would be discharged he would take the next flight to  </p><p></p><p>reach us. Yamini also returned back home uninformed of the entire  </p><p>happenings. We lit diyas all around the house and celebrated  </p><p></p><p>Diwali.</p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p>The End</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This has 803 words (Title not included)</p><p>story not mine, just saw this from another website, you can just copy </p><p>and paste it. </p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>While the term current issues is extremely broad and can be interpreted and defined many different ways, there are certain issues that take precedence in the media and this collection of global issues speeches aims to shed some light and to provide insight from a variety of professionals.</p><p></p><p>At the forefront of pressing issues today is a battle in which society has been engaged forever -- human rights. Members of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities continue to fight for equal rights. The speech by Hillary Clinton insists that the rights of these individuals need to be treated the same away as the rights many other people enjoy today.</p><p></p><p>Another topic discusses here is religion. Religion is one of the most debated topics to exist. Hearing from individuals such as Stephen Fry and Penn Jillette, the religion-focused speeches here discuss whether or not religion should still be a part of certain education systems and the challenges faced be atheists.</p><p></p><p>Another extremely pertinent issues featured here is bullying. The speech by Joel Burns urges educators and school systems to treat bullying much more seriously. School should be a place where children grow and learn, but bullying is creating an extremely crippling and often life-taking obstacle.</p>If this lacks then just add alittle bit<strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>s</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The literal meaning of observation is clear perception of some objects or events. Observation forms the basis of any scientific enquiry. Scientific observation cannot be regarded as just a simple perception of a layman. When some objects or events are observed in a scientific manner, those objects or events are examined systematically. Objective observation is concerned with the events of the external world.</p><p></p><p>Psychologists use objective observation to study the overt activities of the organism. The subjective observation, called introspection, asks a person to look within, and report his mental experiences. BotThe observation may take place in the artificial setting of a laboratory (laboratory observation), or in the natural field settings (naturalistic observation). The observer may be a part of the situation to be observed (participant observation). or may observe from a distance without being a part of the event (non-participant observation). The observer may study the outward activities of other persons in a systematic manner (objective observation), or may observe himself by looking within to analyz his thought processes (subjective observation). Depending on how and where the observation takes place and for what purpose, there are different kinds of observationa methods.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana po makatulong</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The reward center in the brain releases dopamine in response to a pleasurable experience or hyperarousal. If a person experiences hyperarousal while playing video games, the brain associates the activity with dopamine. The person develops a strong drive to seek out that same pleasure again and again.<p></p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that becomes active when individuals participate in something fun and pleasurable, like video games. Some research has shown that dopamine levels rise when kids play video games and therefore, they want to continue to play to get this “hit” of dopamine.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Welcome</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Good evening, everyone. Today, I would like to talk about a topic that affects a lot of people around the world - online gaming addiction. Online gaming is a popular activity that has become a part of our daily lives. However, some people find themselves getting addicted to these games, sometimes to the point where it affects their mental and physical health, as well as their relationships with others. So, why do people get addicted to online games?</p><p></p><p>Firstly, online games can be extremely immersive and engaging. They are designed to keep players hooked and coming back for more. Online games often have complex storylines, exciting challenges, and rewards that keep players interested and motivated. The sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully completing a level or defeating an opponent can be extremely satisfying, and players may find themselves wanting to experience that feeling again and again.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, online games provide an escape from reality. People who are dealing with stress, anxiety, or depression may turn to online games as a way to cope with their problems. In the virtual world of online games, players can be whoever they want to be and do whatever they want to do. They can forget about their problems for a while and immerse.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>another </strong><strong>one:</strong></p><p></p><p>Good afternoon, everyone! Today, I’d like to talk about a topic that has become increasingly important in our digital age: online gaming addiction. With the rise of online gaming and the popularity of games like Fortnite, World of Warcraft, and League of Legends, it’s important to understand why people get addicted to online games.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, online games offer a sense of achievement and recognition. Players can level up and earn rewards for their accomplishments, which can be incredibly rewarding and addicting. Additionally, many online games allow players to compete with others from around the world, which can create a feeling of connection and community.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, online games can provide a sense of escapism. When players enter a virtual world, they can leave behind their real-world problems and immerse themselves in a new reality. This can be especially appealing for individuals who are dealing with stress, anxiety, or depression.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, online games can be designed to be addictive. Game developers use psychological techniques to keep players engaged, such as rewarding players for completing tasks or offering random rewards to keep players coming back. This can lead to players spending hours playing online games without realizing how much time has passed.</p><p></p><p>However, online gaming</p><p></p><p>hope this will help you.</p><p></p>(⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠) Rate me. thanks<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When things go normal, I want to go outside without wearing any protective kit. I just missed living without any restrictions. I want to attend events, be it birthday events, weddings or just special occasions. I just missed the feeling of talking and laughing like there’s nothing to mind.  </p><p>I want to also go traveling with my family and explore many places then take some photos together without social distancing. I also wanted to go back to school already because I really missed learning with teachers who guide us in our learning. There are too many things that I want to do but for now, I will first enjoy the time that I have wherein I can spend together with my family.  </p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST!</strong></p><p></p><br />
