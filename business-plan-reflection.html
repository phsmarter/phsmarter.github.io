                                            Read the excerpt from the interview with E.Y. (Yip) Harburg.  We thought American business was the Rock of Gibraltar. We were the prosperous nation, and nothing could stop us now. A brownstone house was forever. You gave it to your kids and they put marble fronts on it. There was a feeling of continuity. If you made it, it was there forever. Suddenly the big dream exploded.   How do Harburgâs words reflect the experience of many Americans during the Great Depression? Like Harburg, many expected that they could maintain their possessions through the Depression. Like Harburg, many were shocked by stock market collapse and ensuing Depression. Like Harburg, many were grateful for the lessons they learned from the Depression. Like Harburg, many made meticulous plans to prepare for the Depression.</a>

                            29. Read the excerpt from the interview with E.Y. (Yip) Harburg.  We thought American business was the Rock of Gibraltar. We were the prosperous nation, and nothing could stop us now. A brownstone house was forever. You gave it to your kids and they put marble fronts on it. There was a feeling of continuity. If you made it, it was there forever. Suddenly the big dream exploded.   How do Harburgâs words reflect the experience of many Americans during the Great Depression? Like Harburg, many expected that they could maintain their possessions through the Depression. Like Harburg, many were shocked by stock market collapse and ensuing Depression. Like Harburg, many were grateful for the lessons they learned from the Depression. Like Harburg, many made meticulous plans to prepare for the Depression.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>This excerpt from the interview with Edward Yipsel Harberg </strong>is about the nightmarish result of the great depression that started in the year 1929 and ravaged the American economy until 1939. It was a time when they thought nothing could stop the industrial revolution, that is why they referred to it as the <strong>Rock of  Gibraltar,</strong> an immovable natural structure owned by the British.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>This a common mindset within empires, such an event shatters the aura of invincibility and reminds everyone that nothing it forever. </strong>All empires go through ups and downs until it eventually stays down.<strong> Such is the fate of every single empire throughout history.  </strong></p><p>
