                                            Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</a>

                            5. Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</h2><br />
