                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the disadvantages of working while studying is that students sacrifices their time for their studies (Powers, 2013). Working students have less time to study their lesson. Classes which require extensive reading and writing are affected (Powers, 2013). They can be always late for their classes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Balancing work life and studies can be quite hard. Work is exhausting and demanding. You spend about 8 to 12 hours working and by the time you get home, you feel depleted. With most people, this can be a biggest challenge, often causing them to slack on either their work or books.</p><p></p><p></p><p>pa Brainliest</p><p>hope it's helpful</p><br />

                        <p><strong>ESSAY "HOW COMMUNICATION SKILLS CAN HELP US IN LIFE"</strong></p><p><strong>- AT SCHOOL</strong></p><p><strong>- AT WORK</strong></p><p><strong>- IN RELATIONSHIP AND </strong></p><p><strong>- IN SOCIAL INTERACTION</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Communication skills are very important to be applied in various lines of life, both at school, at work, in relationships and in social interactions. </strong>For the sake of realizing learning objectives, communication in learning can simply be interpreted as a process of exchanging ideas and ideas between teachers and students. Therefore, communication in learning must be effective so that it can improve achievement and teaching and learning outcomes. Likewise in the workplace, good communication is important in the workplace because little work is an act in itself. It takes communication to work in a team, and even people working alone must report to their superiors. If you run a business, you must tell your employees what is expected of them. Poor communication leads to errors, failures, and sometimes lawsuits. Effective communication helps prevent these mistakes.</p><p></p><p><strong>No less important is communication in special relationships. </strong>One of the main keys in maintaining the rhythm of a good and healthy relationship is communication. Communication is important to create a sense of belonging and build a feeling of mutual trust in your partner so as not to make the relationship unhealthy and even messy. Good communication is very necessary in a good relationship, it's a love relationship. Many people do not communicate effectively because they are afraid of a response from their partner or because their partner never respects their feelings. Though good communication is a key element in maintaining the stability of a relationship. According to one study conducted in 2018 we can know that conflicts that occur whether they are still in thought or have been formed through physical behavior, then this can create or cause psychological violence either from one party or both parties. In a wider and crucial scope, namely in social interaction. We can find examples of social interaction in everyday life.</p><p></p><p>Social interaction is something that we cannot avoid every day. <strong>Humans are social creatures who interact with other individuals every day.</strong> This social interaction can occur between individuals or groups. The purpose of this reciprocal relationship is to establish friendships, discussions, and collaborations that are applied in social life. One of the characteristics of social interaction is the number of interaction actors more than one or more people. Social interaction occurs when there is communication between social actors using symbols. There are three types of social interactions that exist in our daily lives, namely individual social interaction with individuals, individual social interactions with groups, and group social interactions with groups.</p><p></p><p><strong>Social communication between individuals and individuals</strong>, namely greeting each other and asking how they are passing by neighbors, inviting them to play with their brothers or sisters at home. Another example is a student asking the teacher about the subject matter that has not been understood, father and mother talking together after a long day at work, buyers and traders haggling in the market. Second, the <strong>social communication of individuals with groups</strong>. For example, a resource person gives an explanation at a seminar, a salesperson conducts a cooking demonstration at the social gathering for the neighborhood women, the principal is talking to the students during the ceremony, a teacher is teaching his students in class. Finally, <strong>group communication with the group</strong>. For example, students and college students who carry out real work college work programs provide direction to villagers and inter-class sports competitions.</p><p></p><p>See more about <strong>The Harm Of Interacting With Strangers Online </strong>here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2222082</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Overcoming Challenges</p><p>In pursuing your scientific or engineering research you have undoubtedly encountered obstacles: an experiment or design that did not work as anticipated at first, a grant that fell through, a peer review that identified a problem in your methodology. But surmounting these obstacles can sometimes lead to greater understanding, a stronger design, and better results.</p><p>The same is true with instructional design. Many leaders in research-based instruction readily admit that some of their early attempts were not as successful as they had hoped, and many faced challenges that rattled their resolve. As in scientific research or engineering design, the best response to the inevitable stumble or obstacle is not to give up but to reflect on what you can do better, make adjustments, and persist.</p><p>“Be patient,” advises Alex Rudolph,1 a physics and astronomy professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. “Don’t expect everything to work the first time out. Realize that these things take time to learn and do well…. Be willing to try something and get better at it, because if you do it a few times you almost always get better.”</p><p>Just as many of your students need time, guidance, and encouragement to be successful with new ways of learning, you will need time, practice, and support to become more comfortable and competent with new ways of teaching, and even longer to become adept. Ed Prather,2 an astronomy professor at the University of Arizona, tells participants in his faculty development workshops that “while the first time out of the gate it might not be perfect, they’re making slow and steady progress toward a goal that is part of their profession.” Even instructors who have been using research-based approaches for several years continue to tweak their</p><p></p><br />
