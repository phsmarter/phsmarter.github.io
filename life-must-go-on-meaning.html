Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get . This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Answer here:​</a>

He is a model employee who never had attendance issues and delivered all the required work targets close to above average performance. However, the competition is so cut throat, that the management team thinks that the balance within the company must be disturbed in order to survive in next 3 years of business life. Everybody is convinced that "pirating" Juliana, and replacing John is the right decision to stay competitive. But this will mean letting go of John and paying him a separation pay because keeping Juliana and John will strain the salary funds too much. You are the team leader of the team where John belongs. And John is your close friend. What will you do? Elaborate.​</a>

                                            Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.  The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.​</a>

Maybe what really happened is this: the old fable-makers searched hard for a wordto convey that what is gone is gone forever and never found it. And so, in the best traditions of where we come from, they gave their sorrow a nameand drowned it.1. Relate the poem in your life.​</a>

                            13. Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.  The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.​</h2><br />

Gabrieldoes not agree to his parents' decision because moving to the province means newresidence, neighborhood, and school. He's afraid of the new life waiting for him in theprovince. How is the process Gabriel is going through in the forms of socialization?What new cultural behaviors must he adapt to?​​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer: Our lives have been affected in so many ways by this coronavirus pandemic. Following public policy toward mitigation of this dreaded illness has turned our lives upside down. We have been struggling to find ways to tolerate stay at home orders. To learn new routines within our social isolation and for many to incorporate the education of their children during the day while schools remain closed. And above all, our stress and anxieties are peaked by the fear of contracting coronavirus as we see each day the numbers of confirmed positive cases and deaths from COVID-19. Our sorrows run especially deep as we experience the reality of death or the struggling for survival of friends or family members as a result of this disease. We see many around us, if not even ourselves, who have lost jobs. Jobs that have sustained them and their families just disappeared literally overnight as the American economy had to shut down in order to curtail the spread of the virus. And furthering these emotions, people of faith are experiencing a great suffering of their spirit through the ongoing inability to worship as a church community. We Catholics are finding it especially painful as we hunger and thirst for the Eucharist, now that our attendance at Mass is limited to livestreaming video broadcasts on our televisions and computers. </p><p></p><p>We see and experience so much suffering on many levels for so many people, and we pray prayers of thanksgiving if we have been spared from this illness and the devasting turbulent side effects from it. And through this experience we have come to realize a deep sense of gratitude for those who are continuing the frontline battle against this disease. Those doctors and nurses, all hospital workers, who are putting their lives on the line to save others. And for all those who continue to leave their homes each day, endangering their own health, to keep us fed and sustained with life essential things. Grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, postal workers, truck drivers, food service and supply warehouse workers, all doing their part to help us endure and survive within our new isolated realities.</p><p></p><p>And, during the course of all of this, we have witnessed a tremendous rise in charitable acts and volunteerism within our communities. Everything from making protective masks, preparing food for hospital and nursing home workers, to fund raising for many people who need help due to the collateral damage being done by COVID-19.  </p><p></p><p>As we so often come to discover during and after a crisis passes, there are silver linings and often beautiful byproducts that emerge through the sorrow and pain. This crisis should be no different. There is something that we can all learn and carry with us through and beyond this experience. We of all ages have now come to know better the pain and sorrow, as well as the heartbreak, of true isolation. We have experienced the frustration that comes from being stuck in our homes. We have now lived with the anguish of the loneliness of not being in the daily presence of friends and neighbors. Of not being able to be with children or grandchildren and feel their precious hugs and experience that tender touch of another human person.  </p><p></p><p>As we feel these longings and experience these emotions, we can come to fully embrace them as we realize the reality of what so many of our elderly brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, grandparents and neighbors, feel each day in their lives. In lives that certainly now are being threatened by this pandemic and in lives that will go on after it is controlled and behind us. We now know firsthand these feelings of loneliness that isolation brings them. Isolation from friends as safe physical mobility diminishes. Loneliness and social distancing as circles of friends get smaller or disappear completely due to death. And the resultant feelings of despair and frustration that begin to take over in our elderly loved ones who were once vibrant and joyful people. Our social distancing and isolation of today is only temporary and will end soon. But for many of the elderly in our communities, it will go on way beyond this pandemic.  </p><br />
