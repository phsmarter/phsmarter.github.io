That's among the highest rates in the world -- and the figures were recorded before the most recent lockdown that started in March.(3)-Desperate to avoid more lockdowns and kickstart the faltering economy, the government is now pinning its hopes on vaccines.(4)But while health experts say vaccination is a crucial tool in bringing an end to the pandemic, many Filipinos are skeptical, and vaccination take-up remains dangerously low.(5)-The economic turmoil began last March when Philippines President Rodrigo DuterteSOCIAL:MORAL:ECONOMIC:​</a>

Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I did not leave my homeland, the Philippines. The Philippines has a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514,000 square kilometers. This shows that Filipinos are 100 million in number, and most of them practice Catholicism. Thais, on the other hand, are now 67 million, and most of them are Buddhists. The Philippines has a unitary presidential constitutional form of government, whereas Thailand has a constitutional monarchy administered by a military junta. Despite these few differences, both countries share almost the same tropical climate ranging from rainy to dry and warm, and humid to cool in some inclusive months. Thais and Filipinos are alike in physical features and both speak English as the second language. Just like the Philippines, Thailand also faces environmental issues such as air pollution from vehicular emissions, water pollution from organic and factory wastes, soil erosion, and wildlife population threats. These are only a few of the similarities and differences between the two countries. There are still a lot more things about them to learn and discover. ED​</a>

The Ecology Club Members aimedto reduce the solid waste generated by students amd maintin the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school."Shane Frias, the club president said. "Through our Club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation,"she further explained. They began the project after talking to the student during the general assembly. The student were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. Thete were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, nonbiodegrable,plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future.

Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I did not leave my homeland, the Philippines. The Philippines has a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514,000 square kilometers. This shows that Filipinos are 100 million in number, and most of them practice Catholicism. Thais, on the other hand, are now 67 million, and most of them are Buddhists. The Philippines has a unitary presidential constitutional form of government, whereas Thailand has a constitutional monarchy administered by a military junta. Despite these few differences, both countries share almost the same tropical climate ranging from rainy to dry and warm, and humid to cool in some inclusive months. Thais and Filipinos are alike in physical features and both speak English as the second language. Just like the Philippines, Thailand also faces environmental issues such as air pollution from vehicular emissions, water pollution from organic and factory wastes, soil erosion, and wildlife population threats. These are only a few of the similarities and differences between the two countries. There are still a lot more things about them to learn and discover. ED​</h2><br />
