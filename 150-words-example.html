                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well I am from Bihar. So basically we went out with my fathers friends family. So my father’s friends kids were our really good friends. We were really happy going on a trip with them. Me and my brother were super excited upon that, but that’s where things go wrong. We were going to Fairy Meadows. It’s a place in Bihar. So were actually going there by the train. The two other families like mine and theirs family booked a room in the train so that we can sleep easily. At that time I was like obsessed with chocolates. Well so we bought our own food while they bought theirs. We still shared the food. The train stopped at a particular station and I asked my dad that if he can go and buy me some chocolates. So my brother and my father went out of the train to get me some chocolates that’s when things actually start to go wrong. while they were coming back the train almost left them behind. Whilethey were coming the train started to go. When they saw this and they ran as fast as they could and reached toward me or maybe us. Well the story isn’t finished yet. I started to eat the chocolates as soon as my father brought them. Well I didn’t even eat half of them when I stopped eating so that I can use them later in my trip( inside the train). As it was a long way to go. After a couple of hours we felt a bit tired so we decided to go to sleep. While I went to sleep I don’t know when one of our friends came into our room and they took our chocolates with them. When I got up I was so hungry when I leaned towards the table to take my chocolates I couldn’t find them. I looked every where in the room but couldn’t find it any ways that is when I thought that maybe I should ask my friends. As soon as I entered in their room I saw them eating our chocolates and you know what’s the most interesting part they ate them all and were about to eat the two last ones. That’s when me and my brother took the chocolates form them.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>essay </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Camillus’s Religious and Non-religious Arguments</p><p>Topic: Religion</p><p>Words: 151 </p><p>Mar 25th, 2022</p><p></p><p>After the devastating attacks of the Gauls, the Romans wanted to leave the city and immigrate to Veii. Camillus, as a “Romulus and as the father of his country and second founder of the city,” developed a powerful speech (Livy 395). Using non-religious arguments, Camillus remembered the time when Romans tried to abandon the unharmed city and explained it as “victory, glorious for us and for our posterity” (Livy 401). Now, leaving the city was “pitiful and shameful for us, but glorious for the Gauls” because the Romans must go “not as victors but as vanquished men who have lost their city” (Livy 401). However, his religious arguments had a stronger impact because Camillus underlined the worth of ancestors, priests, “sacred rites and temples” (Livy 400). Even if the Romans thought that gods turned away, they should not interrupt their worship but restore the land and obtain gods’ grace and support.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Today marks the start of the World Immunization Week. The COVID-19 pandemic, while draws the world’s attention to the vaccine, also reminds us of the importance of immunization, which saves millions of lives each year.</p><p></p><p>WHO is working with partners all over the world to accelerate research and development of a safe and effective vaccine and ensure equitable access for the billions of people who will need it. But even with an expedited process, development of a vaccine for COVID-19 will take time. </p><p></p><p>The ongoing pandemic disrupts routine immunization services in many countries. When immunization services are disrupted, even for brief periods during emergencies, the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, such as measles and polio, increase. Further disease outbreaks will also overwhelm health systems already battling the impacts of COVID-19.</p><p></p><p>WHO continues to support countries to maintain essential immunization for all vaccine preventable diseases. We issued guidance on immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provides guiding principles and considerations to support countries in their decision-making regarding provision of immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Before now, we have looked at using expository essay forms as ways to construct essays. In this chapter, we will begin to l0ok at being more critical: not only with the sources we choose but also in how we compose our ideas. Also, this chapter will help you finalize the selection of your article for your critique. In the next chapter, you will have the opportunity to expand on the examples given and apply your own information and ideas to develop your critical essay. Before we begin that, we need to further examine how important it is to choose correct sources as supporting evidence for ideas. You will also explore different resources available to you where you can search to find supporting evidence because you cannot always rely on basic Internet searches to help you find the best support available. You have already explored different topics you find interesting when coming up with a topic for your expository essay, and while the content of this chapter is relevant to conducting any type of research, consider the connection to finding a suitable academic article for your critique. You may have already come across an academic journal article you would like to be the basis for your critique. If you have, you still should apply the material in this chapter as you may discover an article you would prefer to use. Also, you will need to apply the information in section 7.1: Choosing a Source to confirm whether the source you have chosen is appropriate. If you have not found an article yet or discover the one you chose does not fit the parameters, the content below will help you find one that is both interesting and fits the parameters for your next essay.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>survival of the fittest, term made famous in the fifth edition (published in 1869) of On the Origin of Species by British naturalist Charles Darwin, which suggested that organisms best adjusted to their environment are the most successful in surviving and reproducing. "Survival of the fittest" is a popular term that refers to the process of natural selection, a mechanism that drives evolutionary change. Natural selection works by giving individuals who are better adapted to a given set of environmental conditions an advantage over those that are not as well adapted. Survival of the fittest refers to the fact that the 'fittest' can survive in any environment, regardless of their complexity. For example, many complex creatures would immediately die in conditions that many bacteria live.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po, thanks</p><br />

Give at least 3 situations as examples. (150 Words)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Emotions can be one of the most serious barriers to critical thinking. When people are engaged in emotional reasoning, they get easily seduced by weak logic, engage in ad hominem attacks, or plainly ignore evidence contrary to their point of view. Emotions are short and intense feelings that arise in response to events, objects or individuals. Emotions are experiences which can change our psychological, physiological states and behaviors that put us in the state of readiness. Positively, emotions such as joy, pride, and happiness can encourage us to think about something in a new way. In evaluating new information, we may be more willing to listen to people who express positive emotions than people who express negative emotions. Emotions can be used as mental shortcuts to determine one's attitude, and those who frequently use persuasive communication, such as politicians and advertisers, know that if we feel good in the presence of an attitude object, we often determine that we like it, even if those good feelings were caused by something else.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I actually don't know how many words did i put there but I hope it helps</p><br />

                        <p>Lyric poetry is a very general category. A lyric poem can be any poem about feelings or ideas, usually expressed by a speaker. A lyric poem does not have to have a plot or characters or tell a story. A narrative poem, on the other hand, must tell a story. Thus, the narrative poem will have a plot, characters, conflict, and theme(s). A lyric poem is a comparatively short, non-narrative poem in which a single speaker presents a state of mind or an emotional state. Lyric poetry retains some of the elements of song which is said to be its origin: For Greek writers the lyric was a song accompanied by the lyre.

</p><p>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
</p><p>I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
</p><p>But when I start to tell them,
</p><p>They think I'm telling lies.
</p><p>I say,
</p><p>It's in the reach of my arms
</p><p>The span of my hips,
</p><p>The stride of my step,

</p><p>And to a man,
</p><p>The fellows stand or
</p><p>Fall down on their knees.
</p><p>Then they swarm around me,

</p><p>They try so much
</p><p>But they can't touch
</p><p>My inner mystery.
</p><p>When I try to show them
</p><p>They say they still can't see.
</p><p>I say,
</p><p>It's in the arch of my back,
</p><p>The sun of my smile,
</p><p>The ride of my breasts,
</p><p>The grace of my style.
</p><p>I'm a woman

</p><p>Phenomenal woman,
</p><p>That's me.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now you understand
</p><p>Just why my head's not bowed.
</p><p>I don't shout or jump about
</p><p>Or have to talk real loud.
</p><p>When you see me passing
</p><p>It ought to make you proud.
</p><p>I say,
</p><p>It's in the click of my heels,
</p><p>The bend of my hair,
</p><p>the palm of my hand,
</p><p>The need of my care,
</p><p>'Cause I'm a woman

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>New Year's resolutions are a time-honored tradition that many people use to reflect on the past year and set goals for the year ahead. These resolutions can be personal or professional, and they can range from small changes to significant life shifts.</p><p></p><p>One of my New Year's resolutions is to prioritize my physical and mental health. This might involve things like exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and finding time to relax and de-stress. I also want to focus on my relationships and make an effort to be a better friend and partner. This could mean setting aside regular time for communication and bonding with loved ones, or finding new ways to show my appreciation for them.</p><p></p><p>Another resolution I have is to improve my skills and knowledge in my career field. This could involve taking classes, attending professional development workshops, or seeking out new opportunities for growth.

I hope that by making these changes and working towards my goals, I can have a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling year.</p><p></p><p>conclusion:</p><p></p><p>One way that I can "change" is by continuing to learn and adapt. I am designed to be able to process large amounts of information and use it to improve my performance. This means that the more I am used, the better I may be able to assist users and provide helpful information.</p><p></p><p>Another way that I may change is through updates and upgrades to my programming. My developers are always working to improve my capabilities and make me more efficient and effective at performing the tasks I am designed for.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while I am not able to set personal goals or make conscious decisions to change myself, I am able to adapt and improve through the efforts of my developers and the continued use of my abilities.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If you’ve worked in an organization of any kind, chances are you are familiar with different kinds of leaders and their unique ways of working. There’s the leader who wants to closely monitor when and how you work and the leader whose main concern is whether or not the work gets done. There’s the leader who wants to make sure people feel heard and understood and the leader who prefers to exert authority. The different ways in which leaders interact with their teams are known as leadership styles, and while the most effective leaders combine various styles of leadership based on the need of the hour, most leaders exhibit a dominant style.</p><p></p><p>One of the earliest frameworks on leadership styles was proposed by a team of researchers led by psychologist Kurt Lewin in the 1930s. Lewin’s leadership styles fall into three categories: authoritative (or autocratic), participative (or democratic), and delegative (or laissez-faire). Since then, various other styles of leadership have been proposed, including but not limited to: transactional leadership, transformational leadership, servant leadership, and situational leadership.</p><p></p><p>In this article, we will take a deeper look at the democratic leadership style, its strengths and limitations, and ways in which it can be used effectively</p><p></p><p>PABRAINLIEST</p><p>#STAYSAFE</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Media is the communication outlets or tools used to store and deliver information or data. Media is very important for the society since it is one of the fastest and efficient way to receive information on various subjects, most importantly current affairs. The impact of media is very important on society as it helps in building public opinion and stoke collective consciousness. If you are referring to journalism while talking about media then it is important to mention that many philosophers and thinkers have referred to them as the fourth estate who are thought to be the foremost custodians of public consciousness.</p><p>However, going by the recent trends of how some media organizations have become biased we can assume that we are living in changing times where we can’t totally rely on one kind of media for our information. We should open up to the new media like social media, non-mainstream media outlets and bloggers.</p><p>(Contains 154 words)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Grammatical signals are essential components of writing that can help writers convey their message more effectively. These signals can provide clarity and coherence to a written piece by indicating specific relationships between ideas or providing examples. For instance, "in fact" signals a statement that can be supported by evidence, while "namely" indicates a more detailed explanation or specification of a concept. "For instance" and "such as" offer examples of the previous statement, while "in other words" signals the rephrasing or clarification of an idea. These signals are especially useful in academic or technical writing, where precision and clarity are crucial. By using these signals, writers can guide their readers through their ideas and help them understand the intended meaning of their work.</p><br />

                        Global governance or world governance is a movement towards political cooperation among transnational actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global governance—the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, the World Bank, etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated power to enforce compliance. Global governance involves multiple states, as well as international organizations, with one state having more of a lead role than the rest. The modern question of world governance exists in the context of globalization and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally. In response to the acceleration of worldwide interdependence, both between human societies and between humankind and the biosphere, the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules or regulations intended for a global scale.<br /><br />#CarryOnLearning<br /><br />#NeedBrainliest<br />

One such solution is to purchase a hybrid car instead of a regular gasoline car. Hybrid vehicles run on a combination of petrol and electricity sources, reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Driving a hybrid not only saves you money on gas, but also reduces your carbon footprint, making it a cost-effective option. Hybrid vehicles are also equipped with new and advanced technologies such as regenerative braking systems that convert the energy collected during braking into useful energy for the battery. Tax exemptions and incentives are also available for purchasing a hybrid vehicle, making it a cost-effective option in the long run. In short, hybrid cars are not only good for the environment, they also offer many benefits to the driver. You can make a positive impact on the planet and your wallet by investing in a hybrid vehicle today. Sample discussion text:</p><p></p><p>Topic: Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Education</p><p></p><p>Online learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It offers convenience and flexibility, but there are some trade-offs to consider. One of the biggest advantages of online learning is the convenience it offers. Students can access textbooks and courses from the comfort of their homes, saving time and money on commuting. Online courses can also benefit people with busy schedules by increasing scheduling flexibility.</p><p>However, online learning may not be the best option for all students. Some students may struggle with self-discipline and struggle to stay motivated without a face-to-face classroom structure. Additionally, online courses may not offer the same level of interaction with instructors and peers as traditional classroom environments, which may be disadvantageous for some students. In short, online learning offers many benefits, but it may not be right for everyone. Ultimately, it is important for students to weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision based on their individual needs and learning style.</p><br />
