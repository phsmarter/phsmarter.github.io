Do this in your answer sheet.Gaea Katreena CabicoNew coronavirus mutation found in the PhilippinesA mutation of the novel coronavirus believed to be more infectious than the original variant has been detected in the Philippines, genomic researchers said.The new mutation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been reported to have become the dominantcoronavirus strain circulating around the world. Researchers called the new strain G614. When the outbreak began in thecountry last March, the original D614 genotype showed up in the positive samples collected by the Philippine Genome Center (PGC). But in a new study, genomic researchers detected both the D614 and the G614."We now report the detection of the D614 variant among nine randomly selected COVID-19 positive samples collected in Quezon City in July. In the month of June, both the D614 as well as the G614 have been detected in a small sample of positive cases." PGC said in an August 13 bulletin."Although this information confirms the presence of G614 in the Philippines, we note that all the samples tested were fromQuezon City and may not represent the mutational landscape for the whole country," it added.Last month, researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Duke University in North Carolina published a study that a specific change in SARS-CoV-2 virus genome is more infectious in cell culture. The team analyzed the data of 999 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and observed that those infected with G614 had more viral particles in them.They, however, did not find evidence of G614 impact on disease severity. In other words, it was not significantly associated with hospitalization status."There is still no definitive evidence showing that camers of the G614 variant are actually more transmissible than thosewith D614, and the mutation does not appear to substantially affect clinical outcomes as well," PGC said. The genome center stressed the importance of continuously monitoring G614 to help formulate containment, diagnosticand therapeutic strategies: "Itong sinasabi, cila na D614G mutation may higher possibility na mas transmissible siya, mas higher ang level niya na makaka-transmit sya sa iba or infectious. Pero wala pa rin tayong solid evidence to say na yan talaga ay mangyayad." Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a media forum Monday. (They say D614G mutation has higher possibility that it is transmissible, it has higher level that it can transmit to others orinfectious. But we still don't have solid evidence to say that will happen.)She also said that the PGC has been authorized by the DOH to continue the study to gather more information about thevirus. The novel coronavirus has so far infected 161 253 people in the country despite imposing one of the longest andstrictest lockdowns. Of the figure, 112,586 have recovered and 2,665 have died.Questions:1. What is the main topic of this report? 2. Is the overall purpose of the report clear?

Thankfully, through the generosity and support of our education partners which include local government officials, civic groups and none-government organizations, parents, barangay leaders, volunteer teachers, and those in the community who contributed in one way or another, we hurdled past the challenges and difficulties of adapting to the new normal mode of education. This gives us a clear picture that we Filipinos, could rise above any calamity or crisis because we help and support one another,” said Regional Director May Eclar.<br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>It was a warm summer day when I first met my best friend, Sara. We were both in third grade and had just moved to the same town. We bonded over our love for horses and spent countless afternoons pretending to ride them in her backyard. We even convinced her mom to let us take riding lessons together, which quickly became the highlight of our week.</p><p></p><p>But as we got older, things started to change. We both became interested in different activities and started to drift apart. By the time we reached high school, we were hardly speaking anymore. I remember feeling a deep sadness about losing my friend, but I wasn't sure how to bridge the gap that had formed between us.</p><p></p><p>Years went by, and I moved away for college. But every time I came back to visit my hometown, I would think about Sara and wonder what had happened to her. It wasn't until social media became popular that I was finally able to reconnect with her. We messaged back and forth for a while, catching up on each other's lives and reminiscing about our childhood.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, we decided to meet up in person. I was nervous about seeing her again after so many years, but as soon as we hugged each other, it was like no time had passed at all. We spent the day doing some of our favorite childhood activities, like visiting the local petting zoo and riding horses at a nearby stable. It felt like we were kids again, and it was the best feeling in the world.</p><p></p><p>Now, Sara and I make an effort to stay in touch. We still live in different parts of the country, but we talk on the phone regularly and try to visit each other as often as we can. I'm so grateful to have her back in my life, and I often think about how much I wish we had never drifted apart.</p><p></p><p>If I had to describe Sara in detail, I would say that she is one of the most caring and compassionate people I have ever met. She has a great sense of humor and is always willing to lend an ear when someone needs to talk. I admire her strength and resilience, and I feel lucky to call her my friend.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on my relationship with Sara, I realize that sometimes life gets in the way of maintaining close connections with the people we care about. But with a little effort and a lot of love, it's possible to rekindle those friendships and create new memories that will last a lifetime.</p><br />

Do this in your answer sheet.Gaea Katreena CabicoNew coronavirus mutation found in the PhilippinesA mutation of the novel coronavirus believed to be more infectious than the original variant has been detected in the Philippines, genomic researchers said.The new mutation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been reported to have become the dominantcoronavirus strain circulating around the world. Researchers called the new strain G614. When the outbreak began in thecountry last March, the original D614 genotype showed up in the positive samples collected by the Philippine Genome Center (PGC). But in a new study, genomic researchers detected both the D614 and the G614."We now report the detection of the D614 variant among nine randomly selected COVID-19 positive samples collected in Quezon City in July. In the month of June, both the D614 as well as the G614 have been detected in a small sample of positive cases." PGC said in an August 13 bulletin."Although this information confirms the presence of G614 in the Philippines, we note that all the samples tested were fromQuezon City and may not represent the mutational landscape for the whole country," it added.Last month, researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Duke University in North Carolina published a study that a specific change in SARS-CoV-2 virus genome is more infectious in cell culture. The team analyzed the data of 999 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and observed that those infected with G614 had more viral particles in them.They, however, did not find evidence of G614 impact on disease severity. In other words, it was not significantly associated with hospitalization status."There is still no definitive evidence showing that camers of the G614 variant are actually more transmissible than thosewith D614, and the mutation does not appear to substantially affect clinical outcomes as well," PGC said. The genome center stressed the importance of continuously monitoring G614 to help formulate containment, diagnosticand therapeutic strategies: "Itong sinasabi, cila na D614G mutation may higher possibility na mas transmissible siya, mas higher ang level niya na makaka-transmit sya sa iba or infectious. Pero wala pa rin tayong solid evidence to say na yan talaga ay mangyayad." Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a media forum Monday. (They say D614G mutation has higher possibility that it is transmissible, it has higher level that it can transmit to others orinfectious. But we still don't have solid evidence to say that will happen.)She also said that the PGC has been authorized by the DOH to continue the study to gather more information about thevirus. The novel coronavirus has so far infected 161 253 people in the country despite imposing one of the longest andstrictest lockdowns. Of the figure, 112,586 have recovered and 2,665 have died.Questions:1. What is the main topic of this report? 2. Is the overall purpose of the report clear?

                        Answer(s):The main topic of this report is the discovery of a new mutation of the novel coronavirus, known as G614, in the Philippines.Yes, the overall purpose of the report is clear. The author wants to inform the readers about the discovery of the new mutation and its possible implications. The readers are expected to stay updated with the latest developments and continue to follow recommended safety measures.The author starts the report by introducing the new mutation of the novel coronavirus found in the Philippines. The report ends with a statement from the Health Undersecretary emphasizing the importance of continuously monitoring the mutation and gathering more information about the virus.This report conveys information efficiently by presenting the facts and the opinions of the experts in a clear and concise manner. The report is well-structured, and the information is organized logically.This report is interesting because it presents new information about the mutation of the novel coronavirus and its possible implications. The report is also relevant to the ongoing global pandemic, which makes it more engaging for the readers.The author could have included more details about the scientific research and methodology used to identify the new mutation. This could have made the report more interesting and informative for readers who are interested in the technical aspects of the discovery.I was surprised to learn that the G614 mutation does not appear to substantially affect clinical outcomes or hospitalization status, despite being more infectious in cell culture. This highlights the complexity of the virus and the need for further research to understand its behavior and develop effective strategies to combat it.This type of informational report would be good for describing new discoveries or developments related to the pandemic, such as the development of new treatments, vaccines, or public health measures.This type of writing, known as informative writing, focuses on presenting factual information and educating the readers about a particular topic. Narrative writing, on the other hand, focuses on telling a story or describing events in a creative and engaging manner.<p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
