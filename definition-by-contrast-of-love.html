What happens when a Youtube star writes a book by Bong Osorio Since the dawn of the Web and its many versions, numerous Internet sensations have come and gone, but only a few have sustained and continue to increase their following. One of them is Felix Kjellberg, popularly known by his Internet alias "PewDiePie." He is a 20-something Swede who has lingered as YouTube’s biggest star since 2013, garnering over 40 million followers on his channel.

                                            An Ideal Citizen 1. A citizen is a person who lives in a state and is governed by its laws in all matters. An ideal citizen is an asset to a nation. Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?

There are no ugly stones on the beach. But there is this stone that is full of ugly scars--large, grayish, black scars that seem imbedded in its very heart. Some of us are like this stone. We are scarred by our sufferings and heartaches. Looking closely at the stone, I notice whitish colors surrounding the blemishes, which somehow offset the gloom evoked by the black scars. I search my mind, "Do we have whitish colors of peace, faith, and fortitude that could sustain us through the vicissitudes in our lives?" The stone doesn't bury itself and its ugliness in the sand but instead, it lives among its peers, without shame or fear. Once more I peer into my mind, "When we are distraught by sufferings, do we wade through life carrying these scars without rancor in our hearts? Or do we hide in our shell of reclusion and lose all desires to realize our dreams and yearn to love and be loved again? Do we bury ourselves in the sandstorm of self-pity?" I have kept the stone to remind me that in every sorrow, there is a seed of hope, and that beneath the surface of every ugly scar lies a treasure chest of golden opportunities.</a>

Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells ofanimals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When thishappens, the virus uses the cell's chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible forcausing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. Inconclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.7. It is definitely frightful to be infected with COVID-19. Though a large number ofpatients experience mild symptoms, turning it to a severe condition is still a possibility. I could notimagine a patient to experience chest pain, loss of speech or movement, and difficulty in breathingWhat is worse is the patient is all alone when he or she experiences all these struggles. Furthermore,anxiety and self-pity add to the struggle of the patients. Therefore, in order to avoid such conditions,let us not put our guards down from COVID-198. Cooking spaghert is very simple. First, cook pasta according to the instructpackaging. When pasta is cooked, drain it and set aside. Second, sauté garlic and onion in butterThird, add ground beef and cook for 5 minutes. Next, add hotdog and cook for 2 minutadd tomato sauce, banana ketchup, and a small amount of water to make a spaghetti sauce Simmerfor 20 minutes until cooked. Then, pour spaghetti sauce over paste. Finally, top with grated cheeseand serve. These are the easy steps to cook spaghetti.9. Crocodiles and alligators are different species. They don't belong to the samebiological family. Crocodiles came from the family of Crocodilia while alligators came from the familyof Alligatoridae. In terms of their habitat, crocodiles prefer to live in saltwater while alligators live infreshwater like rivers and lakes. The main reason for this geographical separation is that Crocodileshave well-developed salt glands on their tongue that expel large amounts of sait, enabling them tolive in more salty waters. However, alligators' salt glands don't function well, leading them to stick tofreshwater habitats. Another way to differentiate the two is by looking at the shape of their snoutsCracodiles have long pointed V shaped snouts while alligators have rounded U-shaped snouts. Thesefeatures make crocodiles and alligators distinct from each other.10. Despite the problems brought by the pandemic, it has undeniably cultivated certainFilipino values.

Ann Moir, in her controversial book, Brain Sex, points out some contrasting characteristics of man and woman. Man, she says, is more sexually aggressive and expressive than woman. Woman, on the other hand, is generally inhibitive and desirous of company, communion and love. Man's key sense of perception is vision; hence, he enjoys pornography. Woman's superior senses are those of taste, touch, smell and hearing; therefore, she wants to be touched, gentled and caressed. Man is less verbally gifted; thus, he sends his romantic overtures in the form of flowers, chocolates, jewelry, and other tokens of love in lieu of oral expressions of devotion. Unlike man, woman is well equipped to analyze and explain her emotions. She likes to talk things over, share her thoughts and feelings, hopes and fears. Contrasting, yet complementing, are their characteristics.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

There are no ugly stones on the beach. But there is this stone that is full of ugly scars--large, grayish, black scars that seem imbedded in its very heart. Some of us are like this stone. We are scarred by our sufferings and heartaches. Looking closely at the stone, I notice whitish colors surrounding the blemishes, which somehow offset the gloom evoked by the black scars. I search my mind, "Do we have whitish colors of peace, faith, and fortitude that could sustain us through the vicissitudes in our lives?" The stone doesn't bury itself and its ugliness in the sand but instead, it lives among its peers, without shame or fear. Once more I peer into my mind, "When we are distraught by sufferings, do we wade through life carrying these scars without rancor in our hearts? Or do we hide in our shell of reclusion and lose all desires to realize our dreams and yearn to love and be loved again? Do we bury ourselves in the sandstorm of self-pity?" I have kept the stone to remind me that in every sorrow, there is a seed of hope, and that beneath the surface of every ugly scar lies a treasure chest of golden opportunities.</a>

Many issues have been plaguing the sports world recently, especially the question of paying college athletes. Are athletics so important that colleges need to put out millions of dollars per year just to pay for students to play for them? Paying college athletes is like throwing a lit match into a haystack: once the fire is started, it just keeps burning, making a bad situation worse.  There are several differences between the haystack and paying athletes. To start,  throwing a needle in a haystack is a totally negative concept; everything will burn. However, with paying college athletes, some people can find reasons why this could be a positive thing. For instance, some believe paying athletes will bring more competition to the table and make some colleges much more prestigious than others. Others say this will bring in more money and more revenue. A second difference is the end of the situation. At the end of the fire, there is smoke and it will eventually put itself out. However, this is an issue that cannot extinguish itself. No matter what the verdict, someone is going to be unhappy and the "fire" will keep burning.  Despite these differences there are many similarities between the two. One similarity is the haystack going up in flames and the whole educational system going up. If we pay our college athletes the focus will be more on the money than on learning.  College is supposed to prepare a student for life's work through learning, not be life's work. College sports will also become more like professional sports- all about the money and less about the love of the sport. Related to this is the issue of scholarships. Are scholarships not enough pay for the student? And who decides how much money each player receives? Will it depend on how good the player is, what sport they play, what position they are?  Another similarity has to deal with going up in flames. By throwing one little lit match into that haystack, the whole thing goes up. Just by paying college athletes many other issues arise. Yes, paying athletes may bring in more revenue, but how much of that will actually go back to the college or institution? Another issue that comes up is the fairness to other students. Young athletes already receive many things that non- athletes do not. Not only do they have the opportunity to travel and stay overnight in the best hotels, they also get special treatments away from the sport. Some athletes may receive special attention from certain professors or even people throughout the town in which the college is located.  A third similarity between the burning haystack and paying athletes is the rate at which things will "burn". The haystack will burn fast, leaving nothing behind, and getting bigger and bigger as it goes. The same goes for this issue. Everyone wants to voice their own opinion about it, snowballing into a bigger and bigger issue. People will quickly become angry and quick to defend their side.  Paying college athletes is like throwing a lit match into a haystack: the educational system and other issues go up in flames and they will occur very quickly. I believe there are more problems with this idea than there are good things about it. I find nothing about it to be worth spending millions of dollars to pay students to play a game. They need to be worrying more about their studies. This issue will be burning for a long time.</a>

What happens when a Youtube star writes a book by Bong Osorio Since the dawn of the Web and its many versions, numerous Internet sensations have come and gone, but only a few have sustained and continue to increase their following. One of them is Felix Kjellberg, popularly known by his Internet alias "PewDiePie." He is a 20-something Swede who has lingered as YouTube’s biggest star since 2013, garnering over 40 million followers on his channel. This makes him the holder of the Guinness Book of World Records title for generating the most number of subscribers of all time. What’s more astounding about his fame is that his videos have been viewed over 10 billion times but he remains strange and nameless to most of his audience. PewDiePie is a social media phenomenon whose popularity emanates from his one-of-a-kind approach to his video productions, which usually start off with a shrill declaration of his name before he slides into mocking, panicky reactions to various games and activities. At the end, he thanks his "bros" for tuning in. PewDiePie’s fans have multiplied swiftly and become more pervasive because instant communication facilitates increased word of mouth. Following his social media success, PewDiePie ventured into book publishing and came up with This Book Loves You, now a New York Times bestseller that is poised to become an international sensation as well. The tome is an extremely imaginative pictorial collection of direction and advice manifested in gags and witticisms that lampoons Internet memes and passages. As he declared, it is a "parody on self-help books" and is "full of useful quotes." This Book Loves You serves up a lot of toilet humor and impassioned communication. The heftiest improprieties, though, are masked by intriguing visuals or cheeky figures, while still making the message</h2><br />

They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When this happens, the virus uses the cell’s chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible for causing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. In conclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.a.

However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description3. Because of COVID-19 pandemic, there are safety protocols that must be followed when entering some establishments. First you must wear face mask and face shield. Next, present your quarantine pass. Then, the personnel will check your temperature. If your body temperature is 37°C and below, you can enter the establishment. After that, you will fill out a form asking for your contact information. Once done, you can proceed with your transaction but you will be asked to observe social distancing. These measures must be followed to ensure your safety and to avoid getting the virus.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19.

Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?

2.Some scientists claim that Corona Virus can be airborne. However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.

4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission.

There are no ugly stones on the beach. But there is this stone that is full of ugly scars--large, grayish, black scars that seem imbedded in its very heart. Some of us are like this stone. We are scarred by our sufferings and heartaches. Looking closely at the stone, I notice whitish colors surrounding the blemishes, which somehow offset the gloom evoked by the black scars. I search my mind, "Do we have whitish colors of peace, faith, and fortitude that could sustain us through the vicissitudes in our lives?" The stone doesn't bury itself and its ugliness in the sand but instead, it lives among its peers, without shame or fear. Once more I peer into my mind, "When we are distraught by sufferings, do we wade through life carrying these scars without rancor in our hearts? Or do we hide in our shell of reclusion and lose all desires to realize our dreams and yearn to love and be loved again? Do we bury ourselves in the sandstorm of self-pity?" I have kept the stone to remind me that in every sorrow, there is a seed of hope, and that beneath the surface of every ugly scar lies a treasure chest of golden opportunities.</h2><br />

Inconclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.7. It is definitely frightful to be infected with COVID-19. Though a large number ofpatients experience mild symptoms, turning it to a severe condition is still a possibility. I could notimagine a patient to experience chest pain, loss of speech or movement, and difficulty in breathingWhat is worse is the patient is all alone when he or she experiences all these struggles. Furthermore,anxiety and self-pity add to the struggle of the patients. Therefore, in order to avoid such conditions,let us not put our guards down from COVID-198. Cooking spaghert is very simple. First, cook pasta according to the instructpackaging. When pasta is cooked, drain it and set aside. Second, sauté garlic and onion in butterThird, add ground beef and cook for 5 minutes. Next, add hotdog and cook for 2 minutadd tomato sauce, banana ketchup, and a small amount of water to make a spaghetti sauce Simmerfor 20 minutes until cooked. Then, pour spaghetti sauce over paste. Finally, top with grated cheeseand serve. These are the easy steps to cook spaghetti.9. Crocodiles and alligators are different species. They don't belong to the samebiological family. Crocodiles came from the family of Crocodilia while alligators came from the familyof Alligatoridae. In terms of their habitat, crocodiles prefer to live in saltwater while alligators live infreshwater like rivers and lakes. The main reason for this geographical separation is that Crocodileshave well-developed salt glands on their tongue that expel large amounts of sait, enabling them tolive in more salty waters. However, alligators' salt glands don't function well, leading them to stick tofreshwater habitats. Another way to differentiate the two is by looking at the shape of their snoutsCracodiles have long pointed V shaped snouts while alligators have rounded U-shaped snouts. Thesefeatures make crocodiles and alligators distinct from each other.10. Despite the problems brought by the pandemic, it has undeniably cultivated certainFilipino values. Because of the situation, family ties have been strengthened. Filipinos have valuedmore the presence of the family members and enjoy the time together. Also, the crisis made theirfaith to God stronger. Further, they have better realized the importance of proper hygiene, goodnutrition, and a clean environment.

Ann Moir, in her controversial book, Brain Sex, points out some contrasting characteristics of man and woman. Man, she says, is more sexually aggressive and expressive than woman. Woman, on the other hand, is generally inhibitive and desirous of company, communion and love. Man's key sense of perception is vision; hence, he enjoys pornography. Woman's superior senses are those of taste, touch, smell and hearing; therefore, she wants to be touched, gentled and caressed. Man is less verbally gifted; thus, he sends his romantic overtures in the form of flowers, chocolates, jewelry, and other tokens of love in lieu of oral expressions of devotion. Unlike man, woman is well equipped to analyze and explain her emotions. She likes to talk things over, share her thoughts and feelings, hopes and fears. Contrasting, yet complementing, are their characteristics.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

                            22. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent. Giving respect to others is a way of exercising and multiplying our quality of respect, which will inevitably earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, giving respect to all individuals is crucial, and it is an innate quality that we possess. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others, and it helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others. By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

There are no ugly stones on the beach. But there is this stone that is full of ugly scars--large, grayish, black scars that seem imbedded in its very heart. Some of us are like this stone. We are scarred by our sufferings and heartaches. Looking closely at the stone, I notice whitish colors surrounding the blemishes, which somehow offset the gloom evoked by the black scars. I search my mind, "Do we have whitish colors of peace, faith, and fortitude that could sustain us through the vicissitudes in our lives?" The stone doesn't bury itself and its ugliness in the sand but instead, it lives among its peers, without shame or fear. Once more I peer into my mind, "When we are distraught by sufferings, do we wade through life carrying these scars without rancor in our hearts? Or do we hide in our shell of reclusion and lose all desires to realize our dreams and yearn to love and be loved again? Do we bury ourselves in the sandstorm of self-pity?" I have kept the stone to remind me that in every sorrow, there is a seed of hope, and that beneath the surface of every ugly scar lies a treasure chest of golden opportunities.</h2><br />

Many issues have been plaguing the sports world recently, especially the question of paying college athletes. Are athletics so important that colleges need to put out millions of dollars per year just to pay for students to play for them? Paying college athletes is like throwing a lit match into a haystack: once the fire is started, it just keeps burning, making a bad situation worse.  There are several differences between the haystack and paying athletes. To start,  throwing a needle in a haystack is a totally negative concept; everything will burn. However, with paying college athletes, some people can find reasons why this could be a positive thing. For instance, some believe paying athletes will bring more competition to the table and make some colleges much more prestigious than others. Others say this will bring in more money and more revenue. A second difference is the end of the situation. At the end of the fire, there is smoke and it will eventually put itself out. However, this is an issue that cannot extinguish itself. No matter what the verdict, someone is going to be unhappy and the "fire" will keep burning.  Despite these differences there are many similarities between the two. One similarity is the haystack going up in flames and the whole educational system going up. If we pay our college athletes the focus will be more on the money than on learning.  College is supposed to prepare a student for life's work through learning, not be life's work. College sports will also become more like professional sports- all about the money and less about the love of the sport. Related to this is the issue of scholarships. Are scholarships not enough pay for the student? And who decides how much money each player receives? Will it depend on how good the player is, what sport they play, what position they are?  Another similarity has to deal with going up in flames. By throwing one little lit match into that haystack, the whole thing goes up. Just by paying college athletes many other issues arise. Yes, paying athletes may bring in more revenue, but how much of that will actually go back to the college or institution? Another issue that comes up is the fairness to other students. Young athletes already receive many things that non- athletes do not. Not only do they have the opportunity to travel and stay overnight in the best hotels, they also get special treatments away from the sport. Some athletes may receive special attention from certain professors or even people throughout the town in which the college is located.  A third similarity between the burning haystack and paying athletes is the rate at which things will "burn". The haystack will burn fast, leaving nothing behind, and getting bigger and bigger as it goes. The same goes for this issue. Everyone wants to voice their own opinion about it, snowballing into a bigger and bigger issue. People will quickly become angry and quick to defend their side.  Paying college athletes is like throwing a lit match into a haystack: the educational system and other issues go up in flames and they will occur very quickly. I believe there are more problems with this idea than there are good things about it. I find nothing about it to be worth spending millions of dollars to pay students to play a game. They need to be worrying more about their studies. This issue will be burning for a long time.</h2><br />
