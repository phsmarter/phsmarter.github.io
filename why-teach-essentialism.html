                                            Summarization helps you to determine essential ideas and consolidate important details that support them. It also enables you to focus on key words and phrases of an assigned text that are worth noting and remembering. Thus, it teaches you how to take a large selection of text and reduce it to the main points for more concise understanding. Summary is a shortened version of a text that highlights its key points. To summarize is to retell a story in your own words. Writing a summary requires you to make use of your own words, make the original composition shorter, and tell only the important points in the beginning, middle and end. Don't forget also the who (who are the characters), what (what did the characters want), where (where did the story happen), when (when did the story happen), why (state the conflict) and how (how did the story end). The process of writing a summary is further discussed in the following important steps enumerated below.​</a>

 pyramid.DepEd wants to boost information literacy to help students discerndata during crisisBy CNN Philippines StaffPublished May 27, 2020 7:58:10 PMMetro Manila (CNN Philippines, May 27) — Information literacy must be promotedamong students to help them discern accurate data especially during a global health crisis, a
 Department of Education official said.“Information, whether supported or not by scientific evidence, are really out there and
 can move decisions, policies, opinions of people across all facets of life," DepEd UndersecretaryNepomuceno Malaluan said during Wednesday's hearing of the Senate Committee on
 Sustainable Development Goals, Innovation, and Futures Thinking.Malaluan said it is not enough for students to understand the literal meaning of words, but they also have to deal with conflicting opinions, and conflicting evidence, as to be weighedby learners.“This is an [information literacy] area that we really need to strengthen, especially with
 multiple sources of information,” he said.Senator Pia Cayetano, chairman of the committee, said the period during COVID-19
 pandemic should be used to teach kids to verify information before sharing anything online.“If we can create a generation of not just intelligent, but discerning young people who
 will take advantage of this time of COVID to learn to analyze information, ang laking
 pagbabago ng generation [there will be a big difference],” she said.Cayetano added that young people tend to carelessly share fake news online that create
 misinformation. She said it only takes five to ten minutes to verify a source and an information
 that is supposedly worth sharing.Let’s do it!Complete the information needed in the inverted pyramid, based on the news. Write your

DepEd wants to boost information literacy to help students discern data during crisis
By CNN Philippines Staff
Published May 27, 2020 7:58:10 PM
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, May 27) — Information literacy must be promoted among students to help them discern accurate data especially during a global health crisis, a Department of Education official said.
“Information, whether supported or not by scientific evidence, are really out there and can move decisions, policies, opinions of people across all facets of life," DepEd Undersecretary Nepomuceno Malaluan said during Wednesday's hearing of the Senate Committee on Sustainable Development Goals, Innovation, and Futures Thinking.
Malaluan said it is not enough for students to understand the literal meaning of words, but they also have to deal with conflicting opinions, and conflicting evidence, as to be weighed by learners.
“This is an [information literacy] area that we really need to strengthen, especially with multiple sources of information,” he said.
Senator Pia Cayetano, chairman of the committee, said the period during COVID-19 pandemic should be used to teach kids to verify information before sharing anything online.
“If we can create a generation of not just intelligent, but discerning young people who will take advantage of this time of COVID to learn to analyze information, ang laking pagbabago ng generation [there will be a big difference],” she said.
Cayetano added that young people tend to carelessly share fake news online that create misinformation. She said it only takes five to ten minutes to verify a source and an information that is supposedly worth sharing.

                            8. What is the most essential aid of ICT in the teaching and learning process?why do you say so?(ESSAY)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Today we do not need to go any further than our own home or even room, to see some form of ICT in our lives. Whether it be a computer, plasma TV, or mobile phone, we all have them in some part of our lives. In today’s society, people as consumers of ICT, all strive for the one dream – the dream of a connected life.
</p><p>
</p><p>This makes ICT a lifestyle choice for much of the population. In addition, this lifestyle choice is changing the way we communicate, increasing the rate of consumerism, and changing how we interact and gather information (Sherringham, Dec 2008/Jan 2009).
</p><p>
</p><p>ICT has invaded and transformed many aspects of our lives to the extent that we live in an environment that is dominated by technology which itself is consumer-driven (Semenov, 2005). No matter how we perceive its presence, there is no denying that it is an important part of our lives and that it is here to stay.
</p><p>
</p><p> The benefits of ICT in education is of such that students in the classroom can all learn from the curriculum material. Students with special needs are no longer at a disadvantage as they have access to essential material and special ICT tools can be used by students to make use of ICT for their own educational needs. Despite this, it opens up new issues related to the 'digital divide' and providing access to ICT tools and resources for those who are less fortunate.                                     This is an economy where it is vital to have the ability to produce and use information effectively (Weert, 2005). It is a time when ICT is pervasive and permeates throughout all industries in the economy whether it may be health, education, environment or manufacturing (Moon, Feb/Mar 2007). The significance of ICT in the Australian economy was emphasised in the recent article by Alan Patterson, CEO of the Australian Computer Society, in his statement that the “ICT industry now rivals mining in terms of the contribution to the economy” </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            17. Summarization helps you to determine essential ideas and consolidate important details that support them. It also enables you to focus on key words and phrases of an assigned text that are worth noting and remembering. Thus, it teaches you how to take a large selection of text and reduce it to the main points for more concise understanding. Summary is a shortened version of a text that highlights its key points. To summarize is to retell a story in your own words. Writing a summary requires you to make use of your own words, make the original composition shorter, and tell only the important points in the beginning, middle and end. Don't forget also the who (who are the characters), what (what did the characters want), where (where did the story happen), when (when did the story happen), why (state the conflict) and how (how did the story end). The process of writing a summary is further discussed in the following important steps enumerated below.​</h2><br />

The Socratic philosophers in ancient Greece were Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  Studied ethics, virtue, justice, and other ideas relating to human behavior. Following in Socrates' footsteps, he became a teacher and inspired the work of the next great Greek philosopher, Aristotle.</strong></p><p><strong>2.

Aristotle believed that wisdom was virtuous, but that achieving virtue was neither automatic nor did it grant any unification (acquiring) of other virtues. Vision of the virtue's source can be considered as more realistic in comparison with Socrates' one.

DepEd wants to boost information literacy to help students discern data during crisis
By CNN Philippines Staff
Published May 27, 2020 7:58:10 PM
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, May 27) — Information literacy must be promoted among students to help them discern accurate data especially during a global health crisis, a Department of Education official said.
“Information, whether supported or not by scientific evidence, are really out there and can move decisions, policies, opinions of people across all facets of life," DepEd Undersecretary Nepomuceno Malaluan said during Wednesday's hearing of the Senate Committee on Sustainable Development Goals, Innovation, and Futures Thinking.
Malaluan said it is not enough for students to understand the literal meaning of words, but they also have to deal with conflicting opinions, and conflicting evidence, as to be weighed by learners.
“This is an [information literacy] area that we really need to strengthen, especially with multiple sources of information,” he said.
Senator Pia Cayetano, chairman of the committee, said the period during COVID-19 pandemic should be used to teach kids to verify information before sharing anything online.
“If we can create a generation of not just intelligent, but discerning young people who will take advantage of this time of COVID to learn to analyze information, ang laking pagbabago ng generation [there will be a big difference],” she said.
Cayetano added that young people tend to carelessly share fake news online that create misinformation. She said it only takes five to ten minutes to verify a source and an information that is supposedly worth sharing.
