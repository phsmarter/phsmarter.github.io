                                            A. Readings/Discussions Read this essay entitled Put a Little Science in Your Life (by Brian Greene) and answer the questions that follow: "When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones, iPods, personal computers and the Internet, it's easy to see how science (and the technology to which it leads) is woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon—stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology- we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future." Questions: 1. What kind of essay is the given? 2. What argument do the two paragraphs present? 3. Does it give supporting details? Why are supporting details important?​</a>

Transportation is very important in our society especially in the rough times now in this pandemic to have a safe way to travel however the risks and problems to this are pollution and lack of human excercise, the reason I said these are risks from human transportation is because almost all our vehicles run on gas and they just destroy our environment and our health thanks to this gas and the lack of human excercise is because some people become too relying on these transportation that they begin to get lazy and then their body wont function the way it used to now having the difficulty of moving your body and the development of more body mass. </p><p></p><p>Sorry if it is too long you can edit this if you need to and I hope it helps</p><br />
