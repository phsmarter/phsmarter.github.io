listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</a>

                                            Editorial: Waiting for SAP (Excerpt) Who is not in need now? The Social Amelioration Program, much anticipated by citizens struggling under enhanced community quarantine (ECO), faces a challenging implementation. As reported in SunStar Cebu on Apr. 11, Cebu City barangays will start this week the profiling of households to determine the SAP recipients. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act or Republic Act 11469 targets 18 million vulnerable households, which include “4Ps beneficiaries, informal economy workers (directly hired or occasional workers), subcontracted workers, home workers, house helpers, public transportation drivers (pedicab, tricycle, PUVs, TNVS), micro-entrepreneurs and producers, farnily enterprise owners, sub-minimum wage owners, owners, farmers, employees affected by the no-work, no-pay policy, stranded workers, other household members belonging to the vulnerable sectors (senior citizens, PWDs, pregnant and lactating women, solo parents, distressed OFWs, indigent IPs and homeless individuals)". However, based on the guidelines of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), if there is one member of the household whose work was not disrupted, any vulnerable member, such as an elderly person, will be disqualified from availing of the SAP benefit. According to the same SunStar Cebu report, the household profiling begins when the barangay chiefs receive the Social Amelioration Card (SAC) forms from DSWD. The household profiles will be submitted to the Department of Social Welfare Services (DSWS) of the LGU for verification and then to the DSWD for finalization. Can this process be expedited? Will the SAP benefit be received during the ECO when it is most needed? It is clear that, for now, Filipinos will have to rely on fellow Filipinos to meet urgent needs of the present.

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</h2><br />

                            15. Editorial: Waiting for SAP (Excerpt) Who is not in need now? The Social Amelioration Program, much anticipated by citizens struggling under enhanced community quarantine (ECO), faces a challenging implementation. As reported in SunStar Cebu on Apr. 11, Cebu City barangays will start this week the profiling of households to determine the SAP recipients. The Bayanihan to Heal as One Act or Republic Act 11469 targets 18 million vulnerable households, which include “4Ps beneficiaries, informal economy workers (directly hired or occasional workers), subcontracted workers, home workers, house helpers, public transportation drivers (pedicab, tricycle, PUVs, TNVS), micro-entrepreneurs and producers, farnily enterprise owners, sub-minimum wage owners, owners, farmers, employees affected by the no-work, no-pay policy, stranded workers, other household members belonging to the vulnerable sectors (senior citizens, PWDs, pregnant and lactating women, solo parents, distressed OFWs, indigent IPs and homeless individuals)". However, based on the guidelines of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), if there is one member of the household whose work was not disrupted, any vulnerable member, such as an elderly person, will be disqualified from availing of the SAP benefit. According to the same SunStar Cebu report, the household profiling begins when the barangay chiefs receive the Social Amelioration Card (SAC) forms from DSWD. The household profiles will be submitted to the Department of Social Welfare Services (DSWS) of the LGU for verification and then to the DSWD for finalization. Can this process be expedited? Will the SAP benefit be received during the ECO when it is most needed? It is clear that, for now, Filipinos will have to rely on fellow Filipinos to meet urgent needs of the present.

                            20. what are the most challenging obstacles filipino entrepreneur faced these pandemic?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:4 Major Challenges for Entrepreneurs in the Time of COVID-19</strong></p><p>As the COVID-19 continues its disruption, the livelihood of many entrepreneurs and small business owners has been threatened. According to a recent Goldman Sachs survey, 50% of business owners that were surveyed said they didn’t think they could continue business operations for more than three months.
</p><p>
</p><p>Our current situation is deeply unsettling. Entrepreneurs are facing many obstacles, including ensuring the businesses they have put their blood, sweat, and tears into continue to stay afloat. On top of that, many of them have employees that they’re trying to protect and reassure—a monumental task when they themselves are struggling with burnout.  </p><p>From hundreds of discussions with my clients, business owners, and regional leaders, I’ve been able to pinpoint five main worries entrepreneurs are dealing with during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p><p>1. Taking action and moving forward  </p><p>A crisis like the one we’re currently experiencing requires quick thinking in the face of uncertainty. However, with such high stakes on the line, entrepreneurs find themselves dealing with “analysis paralysis,” or the inability to make a decision due to overthinking.  </p><p>Delaying decisions will only lead to more problems—and those problems will require more decisions. As Jeff Boss wrote in a Forbes article about overcoming analysis paralysis, “In the military, it doesn’t matter in which direction you choose to move when under a mortar attack, just so long as you move. Decisions are never final for the simple fact that change is never absolute.”  </p><p>Break down what you need to do into smaller steps and then attend to issues based on their level of urgency. Once you start taking proactive measures, you’ll feel more in control and more confident in your ability to navigate oncoming trials and tribulations.  </p><p>2. Keeping up with legislation  </p><p>The business landscape is changing at a rapid pace. It seems like the government releases new regulations that affect business owners almost every day.  </p><p>In order to understand and follow new legislation and changes, business owners will need to monitor news from the local, state, and federal government daily. Most importantly, make sure you’re getting your information from an official source, such as a government website, a bank representative, accountant, or other professionals in your network.    </p><p>One useful resource is the usa.gov website, which lists pertinent information about health and safety, money and taxes, benefits and grants, and much more.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Finding balance and achieving a healthy mindset  </p><p>Fear. Anxiety. Hopelessness. We’re all experiencing a lot of intense emotions during these ever-evolving times, and entrepreneurs are no exception. To make it worse, there’s an additional level of stress as they try to do best by their employees and customers.  </p><p>It can help to remember the saying “you can’t pour from an empty cup.” Overextending yourself leads to burnout, and once you reach that state you won’t be able to help anyone. That’s why it’s imperative that entrepreneurs carve out time to recharge and take care of themselves.  </p><p>It can be hard to break away from work right now. Be intentional by setting a block of time in your schedule for self-care—whether that be going for a walk, spending time with your family, or enjoying a long, luxurious bath. The more you’re able to find inner calm during this crisis, the better able you are to make decisions and lead your business.  </p><p>4. Dealing with information overload  </p><p>It seems like every minute we’re inundated with a relentless flood of information about COVID-19. While having access to the latest news is undoubtedly a blessing, it can also be a burden. Information overload is a very real thing that occurs when there is too much relevant information being disseminated at the same time.  </p><p>When there’s an information surplus, we tend to miss out on important news or even succumb to potentially harmful misinformation. In fact, a 2018 MIT study found that false news travels faster than true stories on social media.  </p><p>In order to make sense of all the conflicting information out there, entrepreneurs need to take a moment to step back and evaluate whether the information they’re reading is fact-checked and from a reliable source.  </p><p>It’s also good to set a limit for yourself. Continuously exposing yourself to upsetting news will only heighten anxiety. Make it a point to check for updates regularly, but as soon as you start feeling overwhelmed, take a break.
