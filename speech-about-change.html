                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p>This speech takes twenty minutes, provided I don’t get heckled. But for those of you who are in a rush, here’s the short version of what I’m going to say:</p><p></p><p>Climate change is the biggest threat we face.</p><p>If we don’t tackle it the consequences are grim.</p><p>We can tackle it and we are. The three most important things we can do are to stop the activities that cause it; enhance our resilience to its effects; and talk about it.</p><p>Climate change is real</p><p>Say “climate change” and see how most people react. I find it’s a bit like “sustainable development”: a phrase at which many people quietly glaze over and switch off. So here’s the first point: Don’t switch off. Climate change isn’t just words. It is a real Thing. And man-made climate change is a very scary real thing.</p><p></p><p>The rise in global temperature over the last several decades is a matter of public record. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that it can only be explained by one thing: the rise in greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities.</p><p>Some people say that climate change is natural and we shouldn’t worry. The answer to that is that we have indeed had naturally-occurring climate change since the Earth was formed. But none of the natural causes of climate variation, from the Sun’s output, the tilt of the Earth, volcanic activity or emissions from rotting vegetation, can account for the warming we observe today. There is only one thing that can: the emissions from fossil fuels caused by human activities over the last two hundred years. The concentrations of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere have increased by nearly 30% since the beginning of the industrial revolution.</p><p></p><p>It’s not as bad as you think – it’s worse</p><p>Here’s another inconvenient truth. Not only is global warming happening, it may be speeding up. The 20 warmest years on record have all come since 1995. The five warmest years have all been in this decade, the 2010s. 2016 was the hottest year since records began.</p><p></p><br />
                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="create-a-long-persuasive-speech-about-climate-change-or-global-warming-%e2%80%8b">
                            5. Create a long persuasive speech about climate change or global warming ​</h2><br />
                        <p>We now all know – except those who are strenuously doing their best to deny it – that the Earth is in grave danger. The conditions for human life, even the conditions for life itself, are severely threatened. There have been previous radical shifts of climate as well as catastrophic mass extinctions across the almost 4 billion year history of life on earth. What is unique about this particular crisis is that we have no doubt what is causing it. We are. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) 2021 report says that it is “unequivocal” that human activity has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. They used the same word in their last major science assessment report in 2013. Eight years on they add that without immediate and drastic cuts in emissions, the crucial threshold of 2°C warming will be crossed and all life thrown into chaos, resulting in unimaginable destruction and suffering.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If you are in need of a persuasive speech for school, college or work, here is an example of a persuasive speech. It is a very informative speech, but why not have a look at the statistics on NASA’s website?</p><p></p><p>There is little doubt that the planet is warming. Over the last century, the planets temperature has risen by around 1.8 degree fahrenheit (1 degree celsius). The warmest since the mid 1800’s was the 1990s and since then only 1998 has broken this record. The hottest years recorded were 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003. In fact 14 of the hottest years on record have been in the last 15 years.</p><p></p><p>The United Nations panel on climate change projects that the global temperatures will rise 3-10 degrees fahrenheit by the century’s end – enough to have the polar caps all but melted. If the ice caps melt, a vast majority of our countries borders will be under water. Monuments and great buildings, as well as homes and lives will be under water, including New York City.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So now we know what some of the causes are for global warming, how can we as individuals do our part to help save the planet?</p><p></p><p>The answer is simpler than you may think. You don’t have to go miles away from home to protest, or spend masses of money. If you try to follow the few simple steps that I shall now give you, you will have started to help us all.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, plant a tree. This could be easier than it sounds. Join or help out a local wildlife group and ask to plant a tree. Trees, when fully grown, will help keep the planet cooler. On the same point, you could protest against the demolition of the rainforests. This is the same principle, we need the trees to cool our planet and yet they are chopping them down to create roads or homes.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Something as simple as walking instead of taking the car will help reduce pollution. As well as stopping pollution, you are giving yourself exercise, something important for our bodies. So the next time you get into your car, or your motorbike, think – do I have to make this journey by vehicle or can I walk?</p><p></p><p>When you are at home, and your getting a little cold. Put a jumper on and do not adjust the heating. The extra heat produced by our homes also affects the planet. So try wearing an extra layer in winter.</p><p></p><p>If possible, buy your fruit and vegetables from local suppliers. And try to avoid imported goods. The more foreign food that we import the more pollution from aeroplanes and boats it will create.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Keeping to the speed limit can also help the environment. The more you speed the more petrol you are going to use, making the pollution higher. Also, SUV’s make about six times their own weight in CO2 each year. A small efficient diesel car covering the same distance not only uses much less fuel; it makes two thirds less.</p><p></p><p>If possible use solar energy, after all it is free; all you need to buy is the equipment. You can get much of your hot water and heating from the sun and even generate electricity.</p><p></p><p>Reduce, reuse and recycle. Only buy what you need; don’t stock the cupboards with things you may or may not use. Reuse whatever you can, like containers and paper, and recycle what you cannot reuse. It really is as simple as that.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Finally turning off unused sources of power such as televisions and heaters will help the environment, as well as save you money.</p><p></p><p>If everybody stuck to these rules, we would be doing a great thing by protecting the earth. So please take into consideration what I have said, and try to do your part. After all, it will be our next generation that will feel the effects.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>sana makatulong</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>When we are at some point of our lives where we are vulnerable we believe we have got life figured out. We start believing that we are now invincible and nobody can dare touch or harm us. However, it is a mistake to think like that. Life will never seize to inspire us. At every point we will have something new to learn about life.</p><p>I have been on the journey of self development and self improvement for some time now. It was only after I went out of my comfort zone (my home) and saw the real world I understood there was so much to life- challenges, improvements, knowledge, achievements, etc. And it was only when I went out in the real world I had learned the most important lessons- the lessons which can only be learnt better if experienced.</p><p>The most important lessons I learned in my life so far is you have to be patient in your life. Things will come around if you’re patient</p><p>We believe things work out if we are in a hurry. It is true that we must be efficient and fast but sometimes we should not rush into anything. Patience is one of the key to success and people who cannot afford to wait should not expect better results. There’s a beautiful quote that resembles exactly what I mean- “Greatness takes time. Just remember it takes 13 hours to build a Toyota but 6 months to build a Rolls Royce.” So do the work and be patient.</p><br />

                            14. Write a persuasive speech about "Be the Change: Sustainable Lifestyle To Save
Water"</h2><br />
                        <p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>Water is one of the most essential resources on our planet. It sustains life, nourishes our bodies, and helps to grow the food we eat. However, despite its importance, our water resources are being depleted at an alarming rate. Climate change, pollution, and unsustainable consumption patterns are all contributing to the depletion of our water resources. We must take action to save water and preserve this precious resource for future generations.</p><p></p><p>One of the most effective ways we can save water is by adopting a sustainable lifestyle. By making small changes to our daily habits, we can reduce our water consumption and help to protect our planet. Here are some simple steps we can take:</p><p></p><p>First, reduce your water usage at home. This can be done by turning off the tap when you are brushing your teeth, fixing any leaky faucets, and taking shorter showers. By reducing the amount of water you use at home, you can make a significant impact on your water usage.</p><p></p><p>Second, consider the products you use and the impact they have on water resources. For example, opt for eco-friendly laundry detergents and dish soaps that are biodegradable and phosphate-free. By choosing sustainable products, you can reduce the amount of harmful chemicals that end up in our waterways.</p><p></p><p>Third, make changes to your diet. Eating a plant-based diet can significantly reduce your water footprint, as meat production requires much more water than plant-based foods. By reducing your consumption of meat and dairy, you can save water and reduce your carbon footprint.</p><p></p><p>Finally, advocate for change in your community. Speak up about the importance of water conservation, and encourage others to adopt sustainable practices. By working together, we can create a culture of sustainability and protect our water resources for future generations.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, we all have a responsibility to protect our planet and preserve our water resources. By adopting a sustainable lifestyle, we can make a difference and create a brighter future for ourselves and future generations. So, let's be the change we want to see in the world, and start living sustainably today. Thank you.</p><br />

Many people and scientist agree that mankind is the number one cause of climate change. Humans have influenced this by greenhouse gases, methane nitrous oxide. </p><br />

Water"</h2><br />
                        <p>Good morning/afternoon everyone! </p><p></p><p>Today I'm here to talk to you about the importance of sustainable living and how it can help us save water. Water is a precious resource that we all need to survive, yet it is often taken for granted. We use it for drinking, cooking, bathing, and even growing food. But with the world's population increasing and climate change causing more droughts, our water supply is becoming increasingly scarce. </p><p></p><p>That's why it's so important that we all take steps to live more sustainably. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can reduce our water consumption and help preserve this vital resource for future generations. </p><p></p><p>For example, one way to save water is by taking shorter showers. A five-minute shower uses about 25 gallons of water, while a 10-minute shower uses up to 50 gallons! So if you can cut your shower time in half, you'll be saving a lot of water each day. </p><p></p><p>Another way to conserve water is by using low-flow fixtures in your home. Low-flow toilets and faucets use less water than traditional fixtures, so they're a great way to reduce your water usage without sacrificing comfort or convenience. </p><p></p><p>Finally, you can also save water by using rain barrels or other rainwater collection systems. This will allow you to collect rainwater for use in your garden or other outdoor activities instead of relying on municipal sources of water which are often overused and polluted. </p><p></p><p>These are just a few of the ways that we can all work together to conserve this precious resource and ensure its availability for future generations. So let's all do our part and be the change by living more sustainably! Thank you for listening!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To convert direct speech to reported speech when the direct speech is in the form of a request or order, we use the suitable reporting verb in the reported speech (requested, ordered, etc.).
</p><p>While reporting a command/order, we use the verb 'told'.
</p><p>While reporting a request, we use 'asked/requested'.  </p><p>Example:  </p><p>"Go to bed!" - She told him to go to bed. (command)
</p><p>"Could you pass the milk?" - She asked me to pass the milk. (request)</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Indirect speech focuses more on the content of what someone said rather than their exact words. In indirect speech, the structure of the reported clause depends on whether the speaker is reporting a statement, a question or a command.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>mark brainly plz need.. ty</p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>          Each generation is an entirely different world – at least today teenagers can see that in their parents and grandparents. Actually, some of the older people are flexible in their opinions and assimilate to the current reality quickly. It is possible to hear teenagers describing their older family members as modern and progressive people. But in a majority of families, a generation gap still prevails. This term describes how changing moral values create a misunderstanding between people who are supposed to find a common language easily.</p><p>           A change in values is clearly seen in various aspects of life. Romantic relationships are perhaps the most vivid one. Older generations consider a live-in as an insult to a young woman’s dignity; the consent of the country and church mean a lot to those who got used to strict ethics and social norms. Current liberal views look immoral to the elderly because in their time “propriety was a true virtue”.</p><br />

                        <p>Introduction:</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I stand here today to speak to you about one of the most pressing issues of our time – climate change. Climate change is a phenomenon that affects all of us, regardless of our race, religion, or nationality. It is a global problem that requires a global solution. In my speech today, I will discuss the causes and effects of climate change, as well as the measures that we can take to mitigate its impact.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Climate change is caused by a variety of factors, but the most significant one is the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a rise in temperature, which in turn causes a range of devastating effects. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. We are seeing more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, causing sea levels to rise and threatening the homes and livelihoods of millions of people. The oceans are becoming more acidic, endangering marine life and the food chains that depend on them. The list goes on and on.</p><p></p><p>So, what can we do to mitigate the impact of climate change? First and foremost, we need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This can be done in many ways, such as by transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and adopting sustainable transportation systems. We also need to conserve our natural resources, such as forests and wetlands, which act as carbon sinks and help to regulate the Earth's climate. Finally, we need to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change by building more resilient infrastructure, developing early warning systems for extreme weather events, and investing in research and development to find new solutions to the problem.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, climate change is a threat to our planet and to our way of life. It is a problem that requires urgent action, and we must all do our part to address it. By reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, conserving our natural resources, and adapting to the inevitable impacts of climate change, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come. Let us take action now, before it is too late. Thank you.</p><br />
