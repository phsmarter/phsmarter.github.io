While in online classes, some might not have a good internet speed but some don't so teachers might choose modular classes than online classes.</p><p>In today's time when it is not possible to go out and only study at home is allowed, these changes are difficult for students. </p><p>During these hard times that the world is experiencing, it is easy to panic and get upset. Especially during the quarantine, when you feel isolated and very lonely. It may seem that your previous life would never return. Those negative thoughts and feelings can really get to you sometimes. I don’t know about you, but they certainly come to me. I am a bit worried about the new ways of teaching that the government considered necessary for social distancing. </p><p>Adjusting to a new routine is hard.  I try to make my own schedule in order to stay productive.</p><p>In this situation, the hardest thing for me is missing my friends, whom I have not seen for a long time. Probably many children are experiencing this feeling now. Something that helps me is contacting them online.</p><p></p>Hope it helps #CarryOnLearning<br />

                        <p>2. What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. It is not always physical bravery that counts. One must have the courage to face life as it is, to go through sorrows and always sacrifice oneself for the sake of others.</p><p></p><p>3. The story goes that Albrecht came from a large family and had one brother in particular who was also an aspiring artist. They couldn't afford to both to university to study art, so they flipped a coin and Albrecht won. He went to art college while his brother worked to support him and five years later he came back home to work while his brother went to college, except that his brother's hands had been ruined by the rough manual labour of the last five years and so he couldn't go. Albrecht then drew his brother's careworn hands and they became the 'praying hands'. The moral of the story is one of faithfulness and sacrifice and enabling others to achieve their dreams. Which is fine and dandy except that, like the Itzhak Perlman story I wrote about, it annoys me when people draw important life lessons from stories that aren't true.</p><p></p><p></p><p>yan lg alm q e pero sana makatulong.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The world direly needs prudent and frugal use of natural resources. Over exploitation of natural resources has disturbed the balance of natural elements. Pollution, global warming, dwindling forests, grasslands, croplands, etc. have posed serious threat to continuation of life. If we really wish to live well and bequeath our planet to the coming generations in good condition, we must practice prudence and frugality in using the natural resources.</p><p></p><p>We can practice frugality at home, schools, and at any other place by using only as much water, electricity, food, minerals, fuels, etc. We must switch off lights that are on without any use; we should turn off the taps running without any purpose; we must begin to use renewable resources of energy. Let’s be prudent; let’s be frugal.</p><p></p><p>Prudent and frugal use of natural resources will surely be a definite step towards preserving our unique and delicate environment.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

What I did is that I avoid using apostrophe on  my words and I write things again and again in a way that my teacher wouldn't really notice because of the amount of time she had given.

                        <p></p>Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Socialization is the process by which individuals learn and internalize the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture. These two concepts are related because socialization occurs within an ecological context, which influences the development and behavior of individuals.Socialization is the process by which individuals acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values that are necessary to function effectively in society. It is closely related to development and adaptation because socialization plays a key role in shaping an individual's personality, beliefs, and behaviors, which in turn affect their ability to adapt to different social contexts.The key assumptions of Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory are that human development is shaped by the interaction between the individual and the environment, and that this interaction occurs at multiple levels, including the microsystem (immediate environment), mesosystem (interactions between different microsystems), exosystem (external environment), and macrosystem (cultural context).The process of socialization in an ecological context involves the interaction between the individual and their immediate environment (microsystem), which includes family, peers, and other social groups. These interactions shape the individual's beliefs, values, and behaviors, and can have a significant impact on their development and adaptation.The ecological theory is useful in understanding the role of the teacher and the community in the learning of children in schools because it recognizes that development occurs within a broader ecological context. Teachers and community members play a critical role in shaping the microsystems in which children are socialized, and can have a significant impact on their academic achievement and social-emotional development. By understanding the ecological factors that influence learning, educators can design more effective interventions and support systems for children.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Going back to school can be a challenging and overwhelming experience, but it is also an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. Just like climbing a mountain, going back to school requires determination and perseverance to achieve the ultimate goal. The first step in going back to school is setting a clear goal, whether it's to finish a degree, learn a new skill, or advance in a career. The second step is to prepare for the journey by buying textbooks, creating a study schedule and identifying resources that can help with success. Once classes begin, students may find themselves feeling rusty and out of practice, but by reviewing the material, seeking help and utilizing resources, students can regain their footing and find their rhythm. Going back to school is a journey, not a destination, but the rewards are well worth the effort. It opens up new opportunities, expands knowledge and develops new skills, and provides a sense of accomplishment and pride.</p><br />
