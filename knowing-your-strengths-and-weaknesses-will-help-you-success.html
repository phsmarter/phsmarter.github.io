                            5. LADDER to Success Everyone has a story to tell. We have positive experiences that make us feel good and happy, like winning in a school competition, celebrating a milestone, and receiving gifts or praise from other people. We also have negative experiences that make us feel uncomfortable, sad, fearful, or angry, like losing in a game, being sick, or getting a failing grade. These positive and negative experiences can serve as our guide and inspiration in achieving success. Through these experiences we learn from our distakes and we realize the value of our decisions. Here are some tips to success using the LADDER: 1:11 Leam from experiences and make it a point that you continue and move on whatever challenges you may encounter. Acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses, the lessons you learned from your personal experiences, and from other person's experiences, so that you will know what to do in challenging times. Discipline should be observed in your thoughts and actions. This is an important aspect of learning that would help you in your everyday life. 11. Dream big and de better. Always remember successful people dreamed first to become successful. Explore. Discover new things and be open to all possibilities. Do not be afraid to join in organizations or try to learn new skills. Responsible. Be responsible for all the decisions you will make.​</h2><br />
