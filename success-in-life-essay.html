                            10. Do an essay about "how hard we need to achieve our success in life".​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Success is a concept that is different for every person. Whether it means having a great career, a home or a family, success is something everyone strives to achieve. It makes you feel proud, it gives you excitement and it lets you know you have made an impact in a competitive world.</p><p></p><p>Success is not something you attain without putting in effort, however. It is a mindset you must adopt to accomplish your goals and grow as a person, and it takes hard work. In this article, we explain what it can mean to be successful and discuss tips to help you in your personal journey for success.</p><p></p><p>Related: How to Succeed in Your New Job: The First Week, Month and 90 Days</p><p></p><p>Upload your resume on Indeed</p><p>Let employers find you when you create an Indeed Resume</p><p>How do you define success?</p><p>Before you can define success for yourself, you should make a list of what success looks like to you and your family. Then, follow that up with actionable steps you can take to achieve that success. For example, if your success is having a high-paying career, then potential steps would be to further your education or professional training. Or if you see success in an unfulfilled talent like writing, then potential steps might include implementing daily or weekly writing goals to nurture it.</p><p></p><p>There is no right or wrong way to be successful, but there are steps you can take to become more successful based on your own definition of the goal.</p><p></p><p>Tips for how to become successful</p><p>Here is a list of 10 tips to help you become successful in your life:</p><p></p><p> Be committed</p><p>Through commitment, you can gain motivation to pursue success. You should make a list that includes your goal, your level of commitment to the goal and what you are willing to do to achieve that goal. Staying focused on your plan is crucial. It helps to put aside at least 15 minutes per day to think about your plan and work toward it. This will keep your goal fresh in your mind and allow you to continue focusing on it.</p><p></p><p>In determining your commitment to your goal, however, it's important to ensure you have realistic expectations of yourself and the outcome. If your commitment is not paying off after a certain period of time, you should adjust your goal accordingly and revise any necessary steps.</p><p></p><p>At times it may be helpful to ask a friend or family member for support in helping you stick to your commitments. Having someone to hold you accountable for shortcomings and praise your success can really help you stay committed to your goal.</p><p></p><p>Related: Setting Goals to Improve Your Career</p><p></p><p> Learn from the journey</p><p>Rather than focusing strictly on the results of your accomplishments, take notice of the small steps needed to achieve success. If you allow yourself to enjoy small victories along your journey, reaching your goal will become a new adventure each day and you will be more likely to stay on track. By doing this, you will learn new and exciting things along the way, which can help you grow as a person.</p><p></p><p> Have fun along the way</p><p>If the journey to achieve something becomes too tedious, it will be more challenging to succeed. Learning what you are capable of can be fun and exciting, so it is important to keep your goals light and fun in order to have an emotionally-positive experience and keep moving forward without losing perspective.</p><p></p><p> Think positively</p><p>Developing a positive mindset is all about trusting yourself and your ability to succeed. It is important to replace any negative thoughts with positive ones in order to motivate yourself to keep trying no matter what challenges come your way.</p><p></p><p>Think about when babies are learning to walk. They do not stop when they fall. They get back up and keep going until, one day, they are able to move—and soon run—with ease. In your path to become successful, you are likely learning new things and thinking differently than before. Your goals will not happen overnight. They will take practice and discipline to achieve, so it is vital to think about the process positively.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Be honest with yourself</p><p>If you find your goal is at a standstill, you might need to be honest with yourself about why that is. After you have come to an understanding, try to find a solution to push yourself toward success. Challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone. This might mean an extra set of squats, speaking to a supervisor about a promotion or even signing up for a difficult college class that you hadn't considered before.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po </p><br />

                            12. ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAYreason should get a college degree to be successful in life?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Getting a college degree is a significant step towards achieving success in life. While some people may argue that college degrees are not necessary to succeed, there are several reasons why having a college degree is essential. Firstly, a college degree provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their chosen fields. College graduates are equipped with critical thinking skills, communication skills, and problem-solving skills, which are necessary for success in the modern workforce.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, having a college degree increases an individual's earning potential. On average, college graduates earn more than those without a college degree. A higher salary allows individuals to enjoy a better standard of living, which can lead to greater opportunities for personal and professional growth.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, a college degree provides individuals with a broader range of opportunities. Many employers require a college degree for entry-level positions, and a college degree can open doors to higher-level positions with more significant responsibilities and higher salaries.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, obtaining a college degree is an achievement in itself. It requires dedication, hard work, and discipline, which are all traits that can lead to success in other areas of life. College graduates are often more confident and better equipped to face life's challenges.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some may argue that getting a college degree is not necessary to be successful in life, the benefits of having a college degree far outweigh the drawbacks. A college degree provides individuals with the knowledge, skills, and opportunities necessary to succeed in their chosen fields, increase their earning potential, and achieve personal and professional growth.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>KEEP ON LEARNING ^√^</p><br />

Sex Education must be thought in School</strong></p><p></p><p>There is a lot of debate surrounding the topic of sex education and whether or not it should be taught in schools. Some people argue that sex education should not be taught in schools because it is a personal matter and should be left up to parents to teach their children. Others argue that sex education should be taught in schools because it is an important part of a child’s education and it is important for them to learn about the risks and consequences of sex.</p><p></p><p>I believe that sex education should be taught in schools. I think that it is important for children to learn about sex and the risks involved so that they can make informed decisions when they are older. I think that it is also important for children to learn about different contraceptive methods so that they can protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.</p><p></p><p>Some people argue that sex education should not be taught in schools because it is a personal matter and should be left up to parents to teach their children. However, I believe that sex education is an important part of a child’s education and it should be taught in schools. I think that it is important for children to learn about sex and the risks involved so that they can make informed decisions when they are older. </p><p></p><p><strong>or</strong> </p><p></p><p>The purpose of this essay is to argue the need for sex education to be taught in schools. The arguments that will be presented are that sex education is a human right, that it should be taught in an age-appropriate manner, and that it can help to reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. </p><p></p><p>Sexual education is a human right. It is a right that every person should have access to accurate and comprehensive information about their sexual health. This information should be provided in a safe and supportive environment, such as a school. </p><p></p><p>Sexual education should be taught in an age-appropriate manner. It should be tailored to the needs of the students, taking into account their age, stage of development, and cultural background. It should be taught by qualified and experienced teachers. </p><p></p><p>Sexual education can help to reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. It can also help to promote healthy and responsible sexual behaviour.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Poverty is not a hindrance to success</strong></p><p></p><p>I believe that poverty is not a hindrance to success. I have seen many people who have come from poverty and have gone on to achieve great things. I believe that if you have a dream and you are willing to work hard for it, you can achieve anything.</p><p></p><p>There are many successful people who have come from poverty. For example, Oprah Winfrey was born into a poor family in rural Mississippi. She was able to overcome her circumstances and become one of the most successful talk show hosts in the world. J.K. Rowling was also born into a poor family. She was able to overcome her circumstances and become one of the most successful authors in the world.</p><p></p><p>I believe that if you have a dream and you are willing to work hard for it, you can achieve anything. I believe that poverty is not a hindrance to success.</p><p></p><p><strong>or</strong></p><p></p><p>Many people believe that poverty is a hindrance to success. However, this is not always the case. There are many people who have overcome poverty and gone on to achieve great things.</p><p></p><p>One example of this is Oprah Winfrey. Oprah was born into a poor family in Mississippi. Despite her difficult upbringing, she went on to become one of the most successful talk show hosts in the world. She is now a billionaire.</p><p></p><p>Another example is J.K. Rowling. Rowling was born into a poor family in England. She struggled financially for many years, but she never gave up on her dream of becoming a writer. In 1997, she published the first book in the Harry Potter series.
