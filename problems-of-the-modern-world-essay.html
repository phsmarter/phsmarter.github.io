                    <p>Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one&#039;s life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</p>

                                            ACTIVITY 3: Few Minutes to Read It! Academic documents always require a degree of formality to show how they are written. A formal tone is what determines the genre of your academic document. Being formal does not mean to be wordy and stuff your document with long sentences and words. What it means is to be clear, concise, and objective. Let's get to know the degree of formality in the following sentences below. These texts differ in formality. One of the reasons for this difference is the different audiences they are targeting. Read the texts below carefully and then rank them from most formal (1), to most informal (3).__ A. Why write essays? In the modern world our thinking is largely transmitted by speech and through radio and television. At the university, however, you are required to do much of your thinking through writing. In the Humanities and Social Sciences you are inevitably required to produce a considerable number of essays. __B. It's a real shame that something as simple as a dict was not taken account of by nurses, thus causing unnecessary pain to the patient. It probably caused even more pain to the patient's family and friends having to see their loved one die like that. How would we feel if we saw our own relative go through that experience? __C. A major challenge in the national water plan is to determine the trade-offs between the costs of action (such as infrastructure improvements) designed to overcome water problems (such as too much water seepage and evaporation) with the public benefits (such as larger water flows downstream) of such actions.(pahelp po, thanku in advance po)​</a>

                            1. Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</h2><br />

                            2. ACTIVITY 3: Few Minutes to Read It! Academic documents always require a degree of formality to show how they are written. A formal tone is what determines the genre of your academic document. Being formal does not mean to be wordy and stuff your document with long sentences and words. What it means is to be clear, concise, and objective. Let's get to know the degree of formality in the following sentences below. These texts differ in formality. One of the reasons for this difference is the different audiences they are targeting. Read the texts below carefully and then rank them from most formal (1), to most informal (3).__ A. Why write essays? In the modern world our thinking is largely transmitted by speech and through radio and television. At the university, however, you are required to do much of your thinking through writing. In the Humanities and Social Sciences you are inevitably required to produce a considerable number of essays. __B. It's a real shame that something as simple as a dict was not taken account of by nurses, thus causing unnecessary pain to the patient. It probably caused even more pain to the patient's family and friends having to see their loved one die like that. How would we feel if we saw our own relative go through that experience? __C. A major challenge in the national water plan is to determine the trade-offs between the costs of action (such as infrastructure improvements) designed to overcome water problems (such as too much water seepage and evaporation) with the public benefits (such as larger water flows downstream) of such actions.(pahelp po, thanku in advance po)​</h2><br />

The text's purpose is to inform the reader about the importance of writing essays in the university.<br /><br />2. C. A major challenge in the national water plan is to determine the trade-offs between the costs of action (such as infrastructure improvements) designed to overcome water problems (such as too much water seepage and evaporation) with the public benefits (such as larger water flows downstream) of such actions.<br /><br />This text is formal but not as much as the first one. It presents an issue and gives an overview of what the national water plan entails. The language used is specific and concise, and the purpose is to inform the reader about the challenges in the national water plan.<br /><br />3. B. It's a real shame that something as simple as a dict was not taken account of by nurses, thus causing unnecessary pain to the patient. It probably caused even more pain to the patient's family and friends having to see their loved one die like that. How would we feel if we saw our own relative go through that experience?<br /><br />This text is the most informal of the three. It uses contractions and a conversational tone to express an opinion about a specific issue. The purpose of the text is to elicit an emotional response from the reader and make them consider their own feelings towards the issue.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The author's reason for writing is to argue against the practice of grading students and to suggest that it is a flawed system that does not contribute to education.Phrases that prove this answer include "is it right to categorize students," "grading encourages learning and without it students would not study," "the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades," and "grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts."The introduction is not clearly marked, but the first paragraph can be considered the introduction as it introduces the topic of grading and its relationship to education.The body of the essay includes paragraphs 2-5, which provide arguments against the practice of grading students and the flaws of the grading system.Paragraph 1 introduces the topic, paragraph 2 argues that grading is based on fear and encourages cheating, paragraph 3 argues that grading focuses on memorization rather than true learning, paragraph 4 argues that grading creates inequalities and conflicts, and paragraph 5 suggests that the grading system cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul of the educational system.The conclusion is not clearly marked, but the last sentence of paragraph 5 can be considered the conclusion: "To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished."The conclusion summarizes the author's main arguments and suggests that education should not be based on conflict and competition. It also provides a clear thesis statement that grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Mark me Brainliest&lt;3<br />
