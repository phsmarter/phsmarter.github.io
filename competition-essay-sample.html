                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO INADEQUATE COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE.</p><p>             Of the vast assortment of possible solutions to inadequate computer knowledge, four stand out as superior: Automated personal computers, Instruction Manuals, Hands on Learning, and Computer Based Training. The most adequate criteria by which to judge the advantages of these four options are cost of Computer-Aid, Performance of Computers vs. Manual Labor, and Reasonable ways to incorporate computers.</p><p>             Introduction of Possible Solutions.</p><p>             Automated Personal Computers.</p><p>             Personal Computers that would be able to help everyone regardless of whether or not the person would be blind, illiterate, or those who have a hard time understanding computers. Automated Personal Computers could make that possible for everyone. With a voice command and detailed descriptions of your work, why would it not be simple to have a better understanding of computers? However, it has its advantages and disadvantages: The work would become easier but it will also cause people to lose jobs. The overall cost of this new technology would be far beyond demand but it will also be well worth it. You would look into about almost $1,000 per household or even more just to attain this type of technology. Automated Personal Computers seem to be the coming of the new age and pretty soon may even be what the world revolves around.</p><p>             Instruction Manuals.</p><p>             It would possibly be simpler to attain information more efficient by words than to attain the information by screen but it is also a longer process to do so. With instruction manuals, you may end up reading for 48 hours and still not understand what you were trying to in the first place. Instruction Manuals would also be considered a way to incorporate manual labor without outright saying so. In order to use this process of learning, you must first purchase and then sit and set aside hours in order to even began to understand this method</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each year on April 22, people worldwide celebrate World Earth Day. It’s the day dedicated to protecting mother earth. People organize events, rallies, marches, concerts, and different projects to show their support for environmental protection. These activities aim to make the world aware of depleting conditions of our natural resources – land, air, water bodies, and forests.</p><p></p><p>Experts explain how human activities have led to the degradation of nature, why it’s dangerous to live in a polluted environment, and what actions they should take to prevent further damage and improve conditions.</p><p></p><p>The history of Earth Day goes back to the seventies. In the year 1970, people actually realized the grave conditions of our planet and began putting effort into protecting it. 1970 was the first year when Earth Day was celebrated. Millions of people were involved. People took to the streets, asking the government to take steps to protect nature. People from all walks of life gathered and pledged to take care of mother Earth. This way, they showed respect for mother nature and brought environmental problems to people’s attention.</p><p></p><p>US Senator Gaylord Nelson was the main inspiration behind the Earth Day event. Together with environmentalists, activists, students, and general masses, he demanded concrete action in defense of the environment. Moreover, he worked hard to take the problem to the political level.</p><p></p><p>Senator Nelson succeeded in his mission, and the first Earth Day garnered massive support from both government and common people. All people, wealthy, poor, sportsmen, businessmen, farmers, athletes, etc., took part in the event and committed to protecting Earth.</p><p>Earth is the only planet that supports life. It’s unique and the only place that we got. If we can’t protect it, it will endanger our own existence.</p><p></p><p>Life on Earth is dependent on several things. Land, water, soil, forests, air are all necessary for the survival of life on Earth. But rapid industrialization, unchecked consumption of natural resources, deforestation, pollution, climate changes, etc., has caused severe damage to the Earth’s ecosystem.</p><br />

                            9. Essay about producing new scientist through innovations, competitions and inventions for the sustainability for clean and green environment to save mother earth.</h2><br />
                        <p>The making of a scientists often involves finishing at least a four-year degree from a tertiary education institution. Most of the time, students are immersed in books and lectures. What if we can <strong>produce new scientists through innovations, competitions, and inventions to guarantee the sustainability of a clean and green environment and thus saving mother earth?
</strong></p><p>Learning is never only about reading books; it is also about being motivated to remember and practice an information, concept, or skill. If students simply memorize theories from books, chances are they would forget this, and by the time they need it for actual use, they will have to review and thus waste time. An innovative way of making new scientists would mean straying away from the usual lecture and notes methods and moving to new methods like experiential learning. <strong>Producing new scientists through innovations </strong>can be tricky and doing so requires teachers to be creative enough to figure out new methods to educate students. However, this is important because the environment in which students grow and develop influences how they turn out, so if they are trained in an innovative manner, they are likely to be innovative.  </p><p>Similarly, when students are pitched against each other to compete, they are often motivated to do their best. Of course, who would say no to a quiz contest with an exemption in the final exam as a reward? However, while many students are motivated by competition, John Shindler (2009) in his book Transformative Classroom Management notes that makes learners focus on the outcome and not on the process; it also weakens the intrinsic motivation of students not to mention it increases anxiety. Worse, Shindler notes that it develops ‘fear of failure’ in students. This would not be a good quality for scientists since they should go through a series of failed experiments before they arrive at the appropriate outcome. Hence, in developing new scientists, competition may help in teamwork, but too much of it could be dangerous to the individual.  </p><p>In learning, assessment is the most important. The most common forms of assessments would be written exams. However, if we are breeding scientists, practical ones in which they apply what they have so far learned would be a guarantee of their potentials. An invention would be a suitable form of assessment. They must be able to put together something functional to prove that all their years of learning have not been put into waste.
</p><p>Since we are breeding innovative, competitive, and inventive new scientists, we are given hope that the environment could be saved by this new blood of scientists. Exposing them at a young age to the value of protecting the environment will help them focus on agendas related to sustainability of  a clean and green environment. Hence, part of the innovative ways of teaching them would be best related to preserving the environment. They may be asked to compete on topics related to the environment. Finally, they may be asked to invent something for the environment. If such information is gradually implanted in them from a young age, students would grow with much concern for the environment, and these new scientists leave the institution ready to save mother earth.  </p><p>The new scientists bred through innovation, competition, and invention, could easily show <strong>how science could save humanity </strong>and mother earth.  </p><p>Read Related Topics

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>FOOD MARKET<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The four parts of <strong>food marketing</strong> are regularly called the "four Ps" of the marketing blend since they connect with item, value, advancement, and spot. One explanation <strong>food makers</strong> get the biggest level of the retail food dollar is that they give the most separating, esteem added administration. The cash that makers put resources into creating, evaluating, advancement, and setting their items separates a<strong> food </strong>item based on both quality and brand-name acknowledgment. By and large, the marketing blend can increase the value of a <strong>food association's </strong>item.
</p><p>
</p><p>In concluding what kind of new<strong> food items </strong>a customer would most like, a producer can either attempt to foster another food item or attempt to adjust or broaden a current <strong>food</strong>. For instance, a sweet, seasoned yogurt drink would be another item, yet milk in another flavor would be an expansion of a current item. There are three stages to both creating and expanding: produce thoughts, screen thoughts for practicality, and test thoughts for offer. Solely after these means will a <strong>food</strong> item come to public market. Of 100 new food item thoughts that are thought of, simply six come to a supermarket rack.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Give three reasons for preserving food. - Brainly.ph

                            20. How can the marketing mix build competitive advantage?​essay type​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Marketing is the process of communicating value of product or services to customers, including fulfilling the needs 
</p><p>and desires of customers to obtain customer satisfaction. Marketing mix is the general concept in marketing that still 
</p><p>used in business today. Marketing strategy carried out by consolidation between elements of marketing mix to form 
</p><p>the best alignment between the company’s internal capabilities with external environment. Marketing mix elements 
</p><p>as internal capabilities are important factor resources to influence to the competitive advantage. 
</p><p>According Porter (1985) the competitive advantage stems from a firm’s ability to leverage its internal strengths to 
</p><p>respond to external environmental opportunities while avoiding external threats and internal weaknesses. This is 
</p><p>marketing mix strategy is the one of internal strengths companies. Generally the competitive advantage is a 
</p><p>company's efforts to obtain, maintain and manage its valuable resources to generate superior customer value. This is 
</p><p>strengthened by Christensen (2010) opinion that competitive advantage is whatever value a business provide that 
</p><p>motivates its customers (or end users) to purchase its products or services rather than those of its competitors and 
</p><p>that poses impediments to imitation by actual or potential direct competitors. 
</p><p>Thomson (2008) argues that a competitive strategy concerns the specifics of management’s game plan for 
</p><p>competing successfully and achieving a competitive edge over rivals. There are many routes to competitive 
</p><p>advantage, but they all involve giving buyers what they perceive as superior value – a good product at a low price; a 
</p><p>superior product that is worth paying more for; or a best-value offering that represents an attractive combination of 
</p><p>price, features, quality, services, and other appealing attributes. 
</p><p>The description and literature study the above show strength relationship between marketing mix and competitive 
</p><p>advantage. How it is happen in telecommunication service companies being one of the discussion in this paper. 
</p><p>Nowadays the competition between telecommunication service companies in Indonesia very tight, it is because 
</p><p>many operators player in this business. They have to compete in obtain and maintain their customer maximally. The 
</p><p>companies have to providing the best marketing mix strategy to achieve competitive advantage. 
</p><p>Although the seven elements of the marketing mix (7 P) equally important and related to each other, but each 
</p><p>element will give a different impact on the competitive advantage. How much the influence of each element of 
</p><p>marketing mix to the competitive advantage is the research question? 
</p><p>This paper will examine the impact of each element of the marketing mix strategy (7P) to the competitive advantage 
</p><p>in telecommunication service companies in Indonesia. So it will be known which elements of the marketing mix that have a major impact on competitive advantage.</p><p></p><br />
