                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Special education in the Philippines started long before 2001, but significant changes and developments occurred during that period and beyond. Here is a brief history of special education in the Philippines from 2001 to 2023:</p><p></p><p>2001-2004: The Department of Education (DepEd) initiated the Special Education (SPED) Program in public schools, aiming to provide appropriate education for children with disabilities. It was implemented through the establishment of SPED Centers in selected schools, and training of teachers and staff on inclusive education.</p><p></p><p>2005-2008: The Philippine government enacted the Magna Carta for Persons with Disabilities, which mandates equal access to education, employment, and social services for persons with disabilities. The law also created the National Council on Disability Affairs (NCDA) to promote the rights and welfare of persons with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>2009-2012: The DepEd issued policies and guidelines for the implementation of inclusive education in public schools. It includes the integration of children with special needs into regular classrooms, provision of accommodations and support services, and the use of the Individualized Education Program (IEP) for students with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>2013-2016: The K to 12 Basic Education Program was implemented, which included the integration of SPED into the regular education system. It aims to provide inclusive and quality education for all, including children with special needs. The DepEd also launched the Early Language, Literacy, and Numeracy Program to support the development of basic skills for children with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>2017-2020: The DepEd strengthened its efforts towards inclusive education by establishing more SPED Centers in public schools, providing training for teachers and staff, and launching programs for the education of children with hearing and visual impairments, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disabilities.</p><p></p><p>2021-2023: The COVID-19 pandemic affected the education sector, including the provision of special education. The DepEd implemented alternative modes of education, such as online and modular learning, to ensure the continuity of education for all learners, including those with special needs. The agency also launched the SPED Online Program, which provides access to online training courses and resources for teachers, parents, and caregivers of children with special needs.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the history of special education in the Philippines from 2001 to 2023 reflects the government's efforts to promote the rights and welfare of persons with disabilities and provide inclusive education for all learners. While there have been challenges and limitations, significant progress has been made in advancing the education and well-being of children with special needs in the country.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Although many contend that special education was born with the passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) in 1975, it is clear that special educators were beginning to respond to the needs of children with disabilities in public schools nearly a century earlier.</p><br />

The Ordinary Mass is composed of five texts --Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (the first words of the texts) that were included in every Mass, not only in Masses that celebrated special occasions. The Baroque era of Western classical music is usually defined as the period from 1600 to 1750.
