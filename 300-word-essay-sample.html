                            1. essay about facemask 200- 300 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ON BEHALF of the physicians, nurses, and care teams at Mercy Health, we ask that you wear a mask when in public places to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, and perhaps even eliminate the disease from our community. This simple act can bring great benefit to many people.
</p><p>
</p><p>Wearing a mask can make all the difference for the people you love, your friends, neighbors, and our community. We have the ability to safeguard our older family members and protect those close to us who have underlying health issues. Wearing a mask can reduce threats to our community’s essential workers, including medical personnel, who’ve shown their commitment to our safety, health, and well-being. By wearing a mask and helping reduce the numbers of individuals who contract the disease, we can ensure fewer people will suffer serious, long-term effects that continue after recovery from the virus.  </p><p>Here are some guidelines for safeguarding yourself from the coronavirus: when wearing a face mask, be sure it fits properly, extending from the bridge of the nose to the chin, with no gaps along the sides. Wear a mask whenever you visit a public indoor space. When you’re outdoors and unable to maintain a safe social distance of at least 6 feet from other people, be sure to wear a mask.  </p><p>By combining frequent hand washing and social distancing with the use of a face mask, you are proactively safeguarding yourself, your family, friends, and neighbors from the virus. These are important steps that should be shared with those you know, including children ages 2 and older.  </p><p>Caregivers here in the Toledo region know the dangers posed by the coronavirus. We have cared for those who need help breathing in our hospitals. We have helped loved ones say good-bye to their family, sometimes the only way we can — through technology. We have watched as numbers ebb and flow for those who need emergent medical care. Health-care workers across the country have contracted this virus because they are on the front lines of this fight. We remain at a pivot point.  </p><p>The coronavirus remains a danger to all people. The Catholic Health Association, of which Mercy Health is a member, calls us to love thy neighbor by wearing a face mask. It is a safe, simple, and effective way of protecting everyone for the common good. And it shows respect and consideration for front-line workers, caregivers, and first responders.
</p><p>By wearing masks today, we’re working for a future in which our kids’ education is not compromised. One where grandparents can hug their grandkids again. A time when we can go on vacations without fear. The list of all we’ve given up because of the coronavirus is a long one. Together, we can slow the spread of the virus. For yourself, for those you love and all the people who are important in your life, all of us at Mercy Health ask that you wear a mask.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Please mark me brainliest if i'm correct thanks</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a post-secondary environment, academic expectations change from what you may have experienced in high school. The quantity of work you are expected to do is increased. When instructors expect you to read pages upon pages or study hours and hours for one particular course, managing your workload can be challenging. This chapter includes strategies for studying efficiently and managing your time.</p><p></p><p>The quality of the work you do also changes. It is not enough to understand course material and summarize it on an exam. You will also be expected to seriously engage with new ideas by reflecting on them, analyzing them, critiquing them, making connections, drawing conclusions, or finding new ways of thinking about a given subject. Educationally, you are moving into deeper waters. A good introductory writing course will help you swim.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Sampling is the framework on which any form of research is carried out. A suitable sample that meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a research design must be chosen from a given population to carry out studies. In this essay comparison is made between stratified random sampling and convenience sampling. The population on which the researcher is interested in carrying out his or her research may be too large, therefore a suitable sample which can represent the population in correct proportion must be chosen. Restraints such as limitation of time, resources and many other factors necessitate the selection of a sample for research purpose so that better quality data is obtained from it and that the researcher can make statement about</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Discipline begins at home. This is because the home is the first place where children learn and develop their behavior and habits. It is the responsibility of parents and caregivers to set rules and boundaries for children to follow and to consistently enforce those rules. This helps children understand the expectations and consequences of their actions, and teaches them self-control and responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Having discipline at home also creates a safe and stable environment for children to grow and learn. It allows them to feel secure and supported, which can help them develop a positive sense of self-worth and self-esteem. In addition, discipline at home can promote good behavior and manners in children, which can help them navigate social situations and build healthy relationships with others.</p><p></p><p>Overall, discipline begins at home and is an essential part of raising well-rounded and successful individuals. It teaches children the value of self-control and responsibility, and sets them up for success in their future endeavors.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana nakatulong</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I had a dream come true last weekend, quite literally. For the first time in about six months, I was able to browse in a bookstore (one in my neighborhood that's reopened with sanitary and social distancing protocols clearly posted) while wide-awake. In the past, leaving the store without buying anything had felt like a triumph of willpower, but this time it involved some guilt. Only one other person was in the store during my visit, a clerk, and it only seemed fair to her to purchase something. Next time, for sure.
</p><p>
</p><p>To be clear, I am not exactly wanting for reading material, but the element of wish fulfillment is intense even so. Likewise with my spouse, who reports having theater dreams. She has attended at least one play a week, on the most conservative estimate, throughout her entire adult life -- or did until this spring. Performances by excellent companies are livestreamed now, and she has been able to take theater classes online. But there’s more to going to theater than seeing a play -- a ritual-like aspect that can’t be broadcast. Browsing indulges curiosity and involves a degree of chance. The hunger is not for content but for certain qualities of experience, in part communal, that are lost or on hold for the duration.</p><p></p><p>The possibility of turning crisis into opportunity comes up in one of the essays on working from home that appears in the latest issue of the Journal of Scholarly Publishing. “How many of you,” asks Erika Dyck, a history professor at the University of Saskatchewan, “have dreamed of pressing pause on the work treadmill? I am talking about a genuine freeze-frame, reset, and rethink, or a chance to read something that isn’t directly related to a task with a deadline.”
</p><p>
</p><p>But think again: “Let’s not kid ourselves; working from home during a pandemic is not that.” Before the pandemic, Dyck had what seemed like a modus vivendi that balanced parental responsibilities and academic work, including her role as a co-editor of the Canadian Bulletin for Medical History. “Now,” she writes, “despite being relatively isolated or even hiding in a home office, I consistently feel tired and am unable to focus on anything, especially when it comes to writing … My mind has constantly wandered, whether drifting toward the contents of the fridge and the looming prospect of dinner, or more often enveloping me in a fog of wondering whether any of the work we do as academics really matters, or whether we will still have academic institutions in a post-COVID world.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Dyck’s is the most confessional of the essays and, no doubt for that reason, the one that made the most impression on me. At some point her trouble writing it became integral to what she had to say -- in particular, to acknowledging the trouble with “feeling like we need to be productive while people are dying, losing jobs, hungry and scared.”
</p><p>
</p><p>The other four contributors to “A Compilation of Short Takes on Working from Home” recount different levels of difficulty in adjusting to the disruption. Bryan Birchmeier, an intellectual property coordinator at Michigan Publishing and the University of Michigan Press, frames it as a less physically grueling version of the phase known as “tear-down” or “total control” that he went through as in boot camp: “It’s meant to break down any barriers recruits may have to adjusting to a military schedule and to military procedures … We have had to create or adjust to a new schedule and new procedures because so much about our daily routine is different …”
</p><p>
</p><p>At the other extreme is the experience of Olivier Lebert, the manager for two Canadian journals for 15 years, who has telecommuted for 11 of them -- and from France for the past 10. It sounds like the pandemic has not called for that much change in routine, and he can sum up best practices very clearly: establish a schedule. Stick to it. Meet deadlines. Outside your set working hours, relax: “stop responding to professional calls or emails.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Lebert’s recommendations are sensible, and they line up closely with the advice offered in the same symposium by Sarah Buhler, an associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law, and by Kathie Porta Baker, described as “a self-employed manuscript editor, proofreader, and production assistant living and working in Northern Virginia.” But for Lebert, the boot camp-like transformation took place quite a while ago. Work at home has become second nature, though he does not indicate how long that took.
</p><p>
</p><p>We are coming up on six months since the familiar broke. Marking the anniversary of a change sometimes helps to put it in perspective. In this case no commonly accepted date is available to punctuate time into before and after. (March 10 seems a little early, while March 15 is probably too late.) The turn was sudden, sharp, yet a blur. We make adjustments that seem to nudge things a little closer to normal, but with an uneasy awareness that there is so much more loss still to come.</p><p></p><br />

Life comes from the earth and life returns to the earth.</p><p>As far as humans know Earth is unique in the Solar System as being the only planet which is able to support life in all its forms: from basic micro-organisms to highly sophisticated human beings.</p><p>Sustaining life on earth is the one of the biggest problems we are facing right now that is linked to three sustainability pillars: environment, social and economic.

                        <p><strong>Answer:goodluck my boi</strong></p><p>Macramé is a form of textile produced using knotting (rather than weaving or knitting) techniques.
</p><p>
</p><p>The primary knots of macramé are the square (or reef knot) and forms of "hitching": various combinations of half hitches. It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to cover anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cavandoli macramé is one variety that is used to form geometric and free-form patterns like weaving. The Cavandoli style is done mainly in a single knot, the double half-hitch knot. Reverse half hitches are sometimes used to maintain balance when working left and right halves of a balanced piece.
</p><p>
</p><p>Leather or fabric belts are another accessory often created via macramé techniques. Most friendship bracelets exchanged among schoolchildren and teens are created using this method. Vendors at theme parks, malls, seasonal fairs and other public places may sell macramé jewellery or decoration as well.

It is a natural process that helps our body and mind rejuvenate and repair, allowing us to function at our best during the day. Unfortunately, many people overlook the importance of sleep and prioritize other activities over it. In this essay, we will discuss the importance of sleep and why it is crucial for our health.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, sleep is essential for our physical health. During sleep, our body works to repair and regenerate cells, tissues, and organs, helping us to maintain a healthy immune system. Studies have shown that people who get enough sleep are less likely to develop chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Lack of sleep has also been linked to an increased risk of accidents, as it can impair cognitive function and reaction time.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, sleep is vital for our mental health. It is during sleep that our brain processes and consolidates information, allowing us to learn and remember new things. Sleep also helps regulate our mood, and lack of sleep has been linked to depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. Getting enough sleep can help improve our cognitive function, memory, and creativity.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, sleep is crucial for our overall well-being. It helps us feel refreshed, energized, and ready to face the day ahead. Lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, irritability, and a lack of motivation, making it difficult to perform daily tasks and enjoy life.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sleep is an essential part of our daily routine, and it is crucial for our physical, mental, and emotional health. As such, we should prioritize getting enough quality sleep each night, and ensure that we create a sleep-friendly environment to help us achieve this. By prioritizing sleep, we can improve our overall well-being and lead a healthier, happier life.</p><br />

A few decades ago, the world was a big place and what happened in one part of the world took months or even years to reach other parts of the world – if at all. At that time, each country was wrapped up in itself. Each believed its own culture to be the best and few exposed at all, it was usually for short periods of time and not enough to influence them. With television, radio, books and movies being so readily available everywhere, today it is difficult for any culture not to be influenced by other cultures.</p><p></p><p>             The great influences are radio and television. There is no way that any government can keep radio waves out of its own radios, and the service is free. For television, there is some means of control. In Singapore, people are forbidden to install antennae which can receive from satellite transmissions. Hence we cannot receive transmissions from all over the world, much as we would like to. However in such cases, it is probably an attempt to protect the local television stations rather than to keep out foreign culture. Anyway, transmissions from nearby countries cannot be stopped. For example, in Singapore – in order to discourage the use of Chinese dialects – all the Chinese transmissions are in Mandarin.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Teacher Who Inspires Me</p><p></p><p>Throughout our academic journey, we meet different types of teachers - some are strict, some are lenient, and some are just there to fulfill their job description. However, there are only a few teachers who leave a lasting impact on our lives. For me, that teacher is Mrs. Smith.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Smith was my English teacher in high school, and she was unlike any other teacher I had ever met. She had a unique way of teaching, which made the subject interesting and engaging. Her classes were always full of fun activities, discussions, and debates. She had an incredible passion for literature, and it was evident in the way she taught.</p><p></p><p>What inspired me the most about Mrs. Smith was her dedication towards her students. She was not just a teacher, but a mentor, a guide, and a friend. She was always available to help her students, even beyond the classroom. She encouraged us to pursue our interests and to think outside the box. She always believed in our potential and motivated us to do our best.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Smith was not just concerned about our academic performance, but our overall development as well. She often gave us valuable life lessons, which have stayed with me even today. Her positivity and enthusiasm were infectious, and it was impossible to leave her class without feeling inspired.</p><p></p><p>Under her guidance, I discovered my love for literature and writing. She always pushed me to take on new challenges and to never settle for mediocrity. It was her encouragement that helped me become a better writer and develop my own unique style.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Mrs. Smith was not just a teacher who taught me English, but a teacher who inspired me to become a better person. She instilled in me a love for learning, a passion for literature, and a drive to succeed. She is the reason why I believe that teachers can make a significant impact on their students' lives. I am grateful to have had her as my teacher and will always cherish the lessons she taught me.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I have had many teachers in my lifetime and each one of them has affected my attitude toward education in a unique way. I have developed a different relationship with each one of them; and of course, I reminisce about some of my teachers more than other s. A teacher never knows which student he or she is going to inspire to achieve his or her goals. Sometimes, a teacher might feel that he or she has not done much for a student, but that student might feel that that particular teacher has highly contributed to his or her education and has undoubtedly affected his or her attitude about education in a positive way. The purpose of this essay is to describe a teacher who has positively affected my attitude toward education.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
