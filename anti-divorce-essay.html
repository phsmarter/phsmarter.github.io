                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abstract
</p><p>The Philippines and Vatican City are the only states left in the world without divorce. While the 
</p><p>Philippines recognize relative divorce, or legal separation as termed under its Family Code, it has 
</p><p>not sanctioned absolute divorce in the country except for Muslims and foreigners. During pre-
</p><p>colonial times and the Japanese occupation of the country, absolute divorce was legal and widely 
</p><p>practiced. The thesis argues for the reintroduction of absolute divorce into Philippine law on a 
</p><p>legal, pragmatic, and rights-based approach. It argues that divorce protects and strengthens the 
</p><p>family; it is legal, constitutional, and in compliance with the international human rights 
</p><p>obligations of the Philippines; it answers the issues on and inadequacies of the existing legal 
</p><p>framework on nullity, annulment, and legal separation; it is one of the solutions to decrease, if 
</p><p>not end, spousal violence; and its absence is discriminatory on the grounds of social class, 
</p><p>religion, and nationality</p><p></p><p>Acknowledgments

                            3. essay family divorce  introduction, body and conclusion ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p>Divorce is one of the most difficult life experiences a family can go through. It can have a profound impact on the emotional and psychological well-being of all members of the family. The disruption of family structure, roles, and relationships can cause long-term issues that can carry over into adulthood. While divorce does have its negative effects, it also presents an opportunity for families to learn and grow.</p><p></p><p>Body</p><p>Divorce can have a lasting impact on the mental health of those involved. Children in particular are vulnerable to the changes that come with family divorce. They can experience feelings of confusion, guilt, and anger as they cope with the changes to their family structure and dynamics. Studies have also found that children of divorced parents are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and poorer academic performance. In addition, children of divorce are more likely to struggle with relationships and trust issues as they get older.</p><p></p><p>Divorce can also have a significant financial impact on families. The costs associated with divorce can be significant, including legal fees, child support, and alimony. These costs can add up quickly and put a strain on the family’s finances. In addition, many families struggle to adjust to the new financial realities that come with divorce, such as having one less income and having to divide assets.</p><p></p><p>Despite all of the challenges that come with family divorce, there are also opportunities for growth and healing. Divorce can be a difficult but necessary step in order to create a healthier and happier family dynamic. It can be an opportunity to reevaluate family roles and relationships and to create more equitable and fulfilling dynamics. It can also be an opportunity to learn how to communicate more effectively and to develop better problem-solving skills.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Divorce is a difficult and emotional experience for all members of the family. It can have a lasting impact on emotional and financial well-being. However, it also presents an opportunity for families to learn and grow. With open communication and support, family members can use the experience of divorce to create a healthier and happier family dynamic.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Divorce is a process that not only severs the legal ties of marriage, but also dissolves the emotional and physical bonds. It is a decision that is often made after much deliberation and thought and is not one that should be taken lightly. While there are many reasons why a couple may choose to divorce, the decision is often based on a lack of communication and intimacy, unresolved conflict, and a general feeling of unhappiness.</p><p></p><p>The process of divorce can be difficult for both the couple and their children. It can be a time of great upheaval and change and can be emotionally and financially taxing. There are, however, steps that can be taken to make the process as smooth as possible. Couples should try to communicate openly and honestly with each other and work to resolve any outstanding conflicts. They should also seek the help of professionals, such as therapists or divorce attorneys, who can assist them in the process.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the decision to divorce is a personal one. It is a decision that should be made after careful consideration and should not be taken lightly. Divorce is a difficult process, but with the help of professionals, it can be a relatively smooth experience,</p><p></p><br />

                            4. Do you think it is the important to implement laws for legal separation like annulment and divorce? Why? Essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It's important to treat a legal separation as seriously as a divorce because both are orders of the court, containing duties and obligations that each party must legally uphold. If the couple later divorces, judges may consider the details of the separation agreement when ruling on a divorce.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Christian view of marriage is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the Gospels, including the passage you referenced from Matthew 19:5-6. This passage highlights the importance of the union between a man and a woman in marriage and emphasizes the permanence and unity of the marriage bond.</p><p></p><p>Christianity teaches that marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman, instituted by God, and should be a lifelong commitment. The Bible teaches that marriage is a reflection of God's love for His people and that the relationship between a husband and wife should be characterized by mutual love, respect, and self-sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>However, the issue of divorce has been a contentious one within Christianity. While Jesus taught that divorce was not part of God's original plan for marriage and that it should be avoided, He also recognized that it was sometimes necessary due to the hardness of people's hearts (Matthew 19:8).</p><p></p><p>In general, the Catholic Church and many other Christian denominations hold that marriage is a permanent and indissoluble union, except in cases of grave sin or the invalidity of the marriage itself. In cases where divorce is allowed, the Church encourages individuals to seek annulment, which is a process of determining whether the marriage was validly contracted in the first place.</p><p></p><p>While divorce and family breakdown can be difficult and painful, Christianity teaches that God's love and grace are available to all who seek Him. The Church also seeks to support and minister to individuals and families who are going through difficult times, offering pastoral care, counseling, and other resources to help them through their struggles.</p><br />

                            6. argumentative essay You agree or disagree to legalize a divorce in philippines​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, divorce is currently not allowed due to the strong influence of the Catholic Church, which believes in the sanctity of marriage. However, with the changing times and the increasing number of failed marriages, there is a growing need to legalize divorce in the country. I firmly believe that divorce should be legalized in the Philippines for the following reasons.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, not allowing divorce goes against the basic human right to seek happiness and fulfillment. Couples who are trapped in unhappy and abusive marriages should be given the option to dissolve their union legally, without being forced to stay together for the rest of their lives. Denying them this option is a violation of their basic human rights.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, legalizing divorce would provide protection for women who are often the victims of domestic violence and abuse. Women who are in abusive marriages are often unable to leave because they have no legal options. Divorce would give them a legal means to leave the abusive relationship and protect themselves and their children.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, divorce would help reduce the stigma surrounding failed marriages. In the Philippines, there is still a strong cultural and religious stigma attached to divorce, which makes it difficult for those who have gone through it. Legalizing divorce would help remove this stigma and provide a more supportive environment for those who have experienced it.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, legalizing divorce in the Philippines would provide an option for those trapped in unhappy and abusive marriages, protect women and children from domestic violence, and help reduce the stigma surrounding failed marriages. It is time for the government to recognize the need for divorce and provide a legal framework for it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS ^√^</p><br />

                            7. not ligalized divorce in the Philippines... essay 5 paragraph po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Divorce is a legal process by which a marriage is terminated, and both parties are granted the freedom to remarry. While it is a commonly accepted practice in many countries, divorce remains illegal in the Philippines. This is a topic of ongoing debate, with advocates for and against legalizing divorce in the country. In this essay, we will explore some of the reasons why divorce is not legalized in the Philippines and examine some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of changing this law.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, one of the main reasons why divorce is not legalized in the Philippines is due to its religious and cultural beliefs. The Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country, where the church views marriage as a sacred and lifelong commitment. This belief is deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of the country, and many Filipinos see divorce as a violation of this sacred commitment. Furthermore, there are concerns that legalizing divorce would weaken the institution of marriage, undermine traditional family values, and promote a culture of infidelity and promiscuity.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the lack of a divorce law in the Philippines can have severe consequences for women and children. In cases of abusive or dysfunctional marriages, women are often left trapped in these relationships with no legal recourse for ending them. This can result in significant emotional and psychological distress for both the women and their children, who may be exposed to violence or other forms of abuse. Without a legal framework for divorce, these women are left with no option but to continue enduring these abusive relationships, with potentially devastating consequences.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, legalizing divorce in the Philippines could have several potential benefits. For one, it would provide an avenue for couples in dysfunctional or abusive marriages to legally separate and protect themselves and their children from harm. Furthermore, it would allow Filipinos to exercise their right to self-determination and make their own choices about their marriages, rather than being bound by a law that may not reflect their values or needs.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the issue of legalizing divorce in the Philippines is a complex and multifaceted one. While the country's religious and cultural beliefs remain a significant obstacle to its legalization, there are compelling arguments in favor of legalizing it. Ultimately, the decision to legalize divorce should be made with the best interests of all Filipinos in mind, weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks and seeking to promote the safety, well-being, and autonomy of all citizens.</p><p></p><p>Comment if I'm wrong, thanks.</p><p></p><br />

                        <br />We are living in a world where some people think that violence is the only reason to solve every problem.  If people keep this violence around us, it’s not going to get better. Violence has been in this world for centuries now and for the same causes, to gain power of authority. Kids in schools feel superior to others by calling other kids horrible names and making fun of them. Men hit women so they can “earn” their respect back. The point is that violence won’t make you a better person, it will make you a monster and nobody likes a monster.<br /><br />There are many different kinds of violence. One of them is called bullying. The victims of this violence are mostly kids and teenagers around the ages of 10-18. Bullying is when someone says mean things to someone in person or in a social network. Most of the time it happens in the social network because kids thing that by making fun of someone in a social network area, they won’t get in trouble by an adult. This is one of the worst violence in the world because is between kids and teenagers. Most of the teenagers today have very low self-esteem because of the media. They haven’t still found what they want to do with their lives, so, by saying mean things to them, it won’t help them be successful since they think that what they are saying is true.<br /><br />There are over 3.2 million of students that are victims of bullying each year. Because of these, approximately 160,000 teens skip school every day to avoid the bullies. Some of these students drop out of school. Some schools don’t even help the victims that are been bullied. Over two-thirds of students believe that schools respond poorly to bullying, with high percentage of students believing that adult help is infrequent and ineffective. I didn’t know that harassment and bullying has been linked to 75 percent of school-shooting incidents.<br /><br />There have been many cases of suicide because of bullying. One of the recent ones was the suicide of Amanda Todd. She committed suicide on October 10, 2012 at her home in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada.  She was 16 years old when she died. On September 7, 2012, she posted a 9-minute video on YouTube titled My Story: Struggling, bullying, suicide and self-harm, which showed her using flash cards telling her experiences being bullied.  The reason she was bullied was because when she was in 7th grade, she used video chat to meet new people over the internet. People she met would always give her complements about her looks. A stranger convinced her to bare her breasts on camera. He later blackmailed her with threats to expose the topless photo to her friends unless she gave a “show”. The photo of her circulated the internet. She moved to different places to start fresh, but the individual would always disguise himself as a student coming new to school. She tried to kill herself by drinking bleach and an overdose of drugs, but it didn’t work. Students from her school would make fun of her because she failed in her suicide and in her grades. After the entire nightmare, on October 10, 2012 at about 6:00 PM, she was found hanged at her home.<br /><br />Like I said before, most of the teenagers have a very low self-esteem and by telling them mean things, they will only become worst. Everybody makes mistakes. Kids today are always in the internet and they meet strangers everyday. As a parent, you need to pay attention to everything that the kid is doing. If you don’t want to have problems like this, don’t talk to strangers over the internet. Once it’s on the internet it stays there forever.  If you see someone that is being bullied over the internet or at school, contact an adult or confront the person yourself. If we all stand up together against bullying, the world will be a better place. You might think that the one that you are making fun of is a monster because of the stuff he or she has done, but in reality, you are the monster for making them feel worst.<br /><br />Be the change of a good person dont wait for the time that everyone leaves you<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>  <strong>"</strong><strong>Should </strong><strong>We </strong><strong>Legalize </strong><strong>Divorce </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Philippines" </strong></p><p> </p><p>For the longest time, if I'm not mistaken, the party-list group Gabriela has been filing their own version of a divorce bill since they first entered the parliamentary arena. In the 18th Congress, they've already done so—again—as part of their key advocacies.</p><p>This time, they may yet succeed in getting what they've worked really hard to achieve. But maybe not exactly.</p><p>Banish the thought that the divorce bill approved recently by the House committee on population and family relations would pave the way for something like what Las Vegas has in place for a long time now: A no-fuss process that makes it quite easy for couples to disengage, or decouple.</p><p>According to Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, author of one of three divorce bills approved at the committee level in the House of Representatives, the measure has very strict requirements that would not be an easy way out of a rocky marriage.</p><p>The lawmaker explained that their bills have safety measures to ensure that only “exceptional cases” of couples with “irremediably damaged marriage” will benefit from this measure.</p><p>These safety measures include the provision that a prosecutor would be assigned to determine within six months after filing of the divorce petition if the grounds are valid or if there is collusion between parties, and that the court would also apply a judicial dispute resolution mechanism and try to reconcile the parties within this period.</p><p>Divorce is necessary, Lagman pointed out, because the current options under the Family Code—legal separation, annulment of marriage and declaration of nullity—do not give complete reliefs to qualified parties. Legal separation only grants separation “in bed and board” but does not grant severance of marriage bond, while annulment would allow remarriage only on grounds prior to or simultaneous to the solemnization of marriage.</p><p>On the other hand, “divorce will allow grounds that are supervening or during the marriage like marital infidelity, domestic violence, chronic gambling and engagement in illegal drugs and at the same time allow re-marriage,” he explained, adding that it would also offer protection to children who suffer and witness daily torment and stress.</p><p>Over at the Senate, most of the senators are against legalizing divorce and instead prefer to streamline the annulment process “allowed by our faith and belief,” according to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri.</p><p>"What we don’t like about divorce is it seems to be an easy way out." He said shortening the process of Church-decreed annulment would be a “more accepted” option for his colleagues in the Senate.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Reintroduction of Divorce into Philippine Law</p><p></p><p>Abstract
</p><p>The Philippines and Vatican City are the only states left in the world without divorce. While the 
</p><p>Philippines recognize relative divorce, or legal separation as termed under its Family Code, it has 
</p><p>not sanctioned absolute divorce in the country except for Muslims and foreigners. During pre-
</p><p>colonial times and the Japanese occupation of the country, absolute divorce was legal and widely 
</p><p>practiced. The thesis argues for the reintroduction of absolute divorce into Philippine law on a 
</p><p>legal, pragmatic, and rights-based approach. It argues that divorce protects and strengthens the 
</p><p>family; it is legal, constitutional, and in compliance with the international human rights 
</p><p>obligations of the Philippines; it answers the issues on and inadequacies of the existing legal 
</p><p>framework on nullity, annulment, and legal separation; it is one of the solutions to decrease, if 
</p><p>not end, spousal violence; and its absence is discriminatory on the grounds of social class, religion and nationality</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student, I firmly believe that anti-bullying and anti-hazing campaigns are essential in creating a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. These campaigns aim to address issues that often go unnoticed but can have long-lasting impacts on individuals and communities. Through these campaigns, we learn about the negative effects of bullying and hazing, and how we can prevent and intervene in these situations. Additionally, we also learn about the importance of acceptance and respect for diversity. </p><p></p><p>As a reflection, I think that these campaigns have been effective in creating awareness and addressing these issues. However, more needs to be done to ensure that students feel safe and included in their school communities. It is important for schools to have clear policies and procedures in place for dealing with bullying and hazing, as well as providing support for victims and bystanders. </p><p></p><p>In terms of mechanics, I tried my best to make sure that my essay is free from any grammatical or spelling errors. I also made sure to follow proper sentence structure and use appropriate vocabulary. Overall, I believe that my essay effectively communicates my thoughts and reflections on the importance of anti-bullying and anti-hazing campaigns in promoting a safe and inclusive environment in schools.</p><br />

Additionally, bullying can be a result of peer pressure or an attempt to fit in with the “in” crowd.</p><p></p><p>There are several steps that can be taken to prevent bullying. First, schools should have a clear anti-bullying policy in place and make sure that everyone is aware of it. This should include consequences for bullying behavior, as well as strategies to help students who are being bullied. Additionally, students should be taught to respect one another and to be tolerant of differences in culture, religion, and beliefs.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>“Most bullying takes place in school, outside on school grounds, and on the school bus community (“Facts about Bulling”).” So it is easy to say that bullying is affecting many schools and this issue should be addressed should be addressed. This trending topic has boomed in most schools creating the emergence of many organizations and programs at state and local levels that are working towards decreasing bullying. There are some programs and organizations that are successful and are able to really impact students while there are others that are not so much. In order for bullying to cease being such a big problem in schools Anti-Bullying programs and organizations must improve the way they inform and teach children how to deal with this…show more content…</p><p>Most teachers and adults see only the physical level of bullying. They do not see that bullying can take many forms and can happen everywhere. For example when a kid is made uncomfortable in a class scenario that is not called for, or when a student is being made fun of or shunned because of their race, background or sexual orientation. These are all forms of bullying that many adults lack to see and sometimes even commit themselves. Teachers as the adults setting the rules in schools should recognize these many forms of bullying and serve as role models to other students.</p><p>In schools, bullying is starting to become a big problem. While some kids learn about reading, math and how to socialize with their classmates, others learn how to abuse and bully others. Without the careful eye of an adult some kids might start to bully other children to hide their vulnerabilities. Being vulnerable or scared in a different or unfamiliar setting than their immediate home is a common feeling that many people feel but the way it is handled is what makes the difference. Bullies lack the ability to handle their fears in a school environment and what they end up doing is bullying other kids in order to hide their own insecurities. Schools are affected by this mostly because school is a child’s second home, they spend 7 hours of their day and even more if they are in other afterschool activities in school. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Legalization of divorce in the Philippines is a highly controversial issue that has been widely debated for years. The Philippines is one of the few countries in the world where divorce is not allowed, and it is the only country where it is illegal for all citizens, regardless of their religion or cultural background.</p><p></p><p>Proponents of divorce argue that it is a basic human right for individuals to have the freedom to dissolve their marriage if they are in an unhappy or abusive relationship. It provides a legal and moral way out of a marriage that is causing emotional distress, physical harm, or financial instability. It also protects the rights of women and children by allowing them to escape from abusive relationships and seek legal protection.</p><p></p><p>Opponents of divorce, on the other hand, argue that it undermines the sanctity of marriage and the family. They believe that divorce can have a negative impact on children, who may suffer emotional and psychological trauma as a result of their parents' separation. Furthermore, they argue that it can have a negative impact on society as a whole, leading to a breakdown of traditional values and increasing rates of crime, poverty, and social unrest.</p><p></p><p>Despite these opposing views, there is growing support for the legalization of divorce in the Philippines. In 2018, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would allow divorce in certain circumstances, such as when the marriage is irreparable or when one of the spouses has committed adultery. However, the bill has yet to be passed by the Senate, which remains divided on the issue.</p><p></p><p>The push for the legalization of divorce is also gaining momentum from the Catholic Church, which has long been an opponent of divorce. In recent years, some Catholic leaders have recognized that divorce can be a necessary solution for people in abusive or dysfunctional marriages.</p><p></p><p>The legalization of divorce in the Philippines would bring the country in line with many other countries that recognize divorce as a legal and moral option for people in troubled marriages. It would also provide legal protections and recourse for people in abusive marriages, particularly women and children.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the legalization of divorce in the Philippines is a complex and contentious issue that raises important questions about the role of marriage in society and the rights of individuals.

                        <p>Anti-bullying and anti-hazing campaigns have become increasingly prevalent in schools and communities in recent years. This is a positive development as both bullying and hazing can have serious consequences for those involved. Bullying can cause emotional and psychological distress, while hazing can lead to physical harm and sometimes even death. It is important that we take a strong stance against these behaviors and work to prevent them from happening in the first place.</p><p></p><p>One way to combat bullying and hazing is through education. Students need to understand the harmful effects of these behaviors and how they can be prevented. Schools can implement anti-bullying and anti-hazing programs that teach students about respect, empathy, and the importance of treating others with kindness. Parents and educators can also have open and honest conversations with children about bullying and hazing, making sure they understand the impact of their actions on others. By educating students and raising awareness about these issues, we can create a safer and more inclusive environment for everyone.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is important that we all take responsibility for creating a safe and welcoming environment for all individuals. By promoting respect, empathy, and kindness, we can prevent bullying and hazing from occurring in our schools and communities. It is up to all of us to work together to put an end to these harmful behaviors and ensure that everyone feels valued and respected. Let us all work together to create a world where bullying and hazing are not tolerated, and everyone feels safe and supported.</p><br />

                        <p>NO, Because Divorce has been seen to have a negative effect on the children involved, especially during the transition period as they deal with the separation of their parents. This may manifest in various ways such as diminished social skills, proneness to anger and increased irritability.Divorce also does not safeguard or promote the mental and physical health of children as it is difficult to cope with one’s problems when one’s family, their main support system, is broken apart.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the divorce may influence the child into losing faith in the concept of a family entirely, which leads to another negative effect of this process. If divorce were to be legalized, it would amplify the mentality that marriage can be easily broken, which may result in people putting less effort into making it last and ensuring that they will pick the right partner. The family is thus put into danger and further exposed to the risk of breaking apart.</p><p></p><p>Abortion should not be legalized in the Philippines for it is a painful surgery. Despite the use of such anesthetics, Almost 97% of women that committed abortions have been reported experiencing extreme pain during the procedure. Compared to other pains, researchers have rated the pain from abortion as more afflictive than a bone fracture, about the same as cancer pain. The use of more powerful general anesthetics can reduce the pain, but it increases the risk of cervical injury. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>sana makatulong </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
