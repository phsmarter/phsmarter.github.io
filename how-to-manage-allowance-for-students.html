                                            Imagine that the manager of a designer clothing store believes that certain types of people are more likely to visit their store and purchase their clothing than others. To decipher which segment groups are most likely to be their customers, the manager could design a survey for anyone who has been a visitor. This survey could include closed-ended questions on gender, age, employment status, and any other demographic information they'd like to know. Then, it would be followed by questions on how often they visit the store and the amount of money they spend annually. Since all the questions are closed-ended, the store manager could easily quantify the responses and determine the profile of their typical customer. In this case, the manager may learn that her most frequent customers are female students, ages 18-25. This knowledge would allow her to move forward with an action plan on how to cater to this niche better or break into other target demographics. Make a sample questionnaire out of this situation.​</a>

Mary Rose threw the ball.2, In English, what is the difference between a Subject and an Object? Analyze this story and answer the questions that follow. Mr. Libangan is the Principal of Divine Temple Academy.  He has a problem with one of the teachers, Mrs. Javier.   Mrs. Javier is already 58 years old.  The retirement age for teachers is 60 so she can still teach for two more years.  For the past 25 years, she had been a model teacher who prepared excellent lessons, managed the class well and was very much loved by the students and her co-teachers.  But lately, Mrs. Javier’s age and health seem to be affecting her teaching.  She attends training but she cannot learn how to use technology in her class.  She still uses cartolina while all other teachers use laptops and E-tablets.  Her class gets bored.  She is also very forgetful lately.  One time, she forgot the test papers of the students in the cafeteria.  She did not know that many students were able to get a copy so many students got perfect scores in the test.  In another time, she was found sleeping in the faculty room when it was actually time for her class.  And just recently, she brought home the report cards of her class but left them in the bus.  As a result, the students’ cards were not given during the card distribution day.  The parents of the students got very angry and went to Mr. Libangan, demanding that Mrs. Javier be dismissed.  Mr. Libangan knows that Mrs. Javier is sorry for her mistakes and that she is still trying her best to become a good teacher.  But Mr. Libangan also knows that if he still allows Mrs. Javier to teach for two more years, more problems will arise and more parents would protest against her and might even sue the school.3, If you were Mr. Libangan, what will you do?  Why?  4,Talk with your seatmates, share your answer then come up with the best solution you can suggest to Mr. Libangan.  Write your revised answer here: ​</a>

                            3. Imagine that the manager of a designer clothing store believes that certain types of people are more likely to visit their store and purchase their clothing than others. To decipher which segment groups are most likely to be their customers, the manager could design a survey for anyone who has been a visitor. This survey could include closed-ended questions on gender, age, employment status, and any other demographic information they'd like to know. Then, it would be followed by questions on how often they visit the store and the amount of money they spend annually. Since all the questions are closed-ended, the store manager could easily quantify the responses and determine the profile of their typical customer. In this case, the manager may learn that her most frequent customers are female students, ages 18-25. This knowledge would allow her to move forward with an action plan on how to cater to this niche better or break into other target demographics. Make a sample questionnaire out of this situation.​</h2><br />

                            7. Imagine that the manager of a designer clothing store believes that certain types of
people are more likely to visit their store and purchase their clothing than others.
To decipher which segment groups are most likely to be their customers, the
manager could design a survey for anyone who has been a visitor. This survey
could include closed-ended questions on gender, age, employment status, and any
other demographic information they'd like to know. Then, it would be followed by
questions on how often they visit the store and the amount of money they spend
annually. Since all the questions are closed-ended, the store manager could easily
quantify the responses and determine the profile of their typical customer. In this
case, the manager may learn that her most frequent customers are female
students, ages 18-25. This knowledge would allow her to move forward with an
action plan on how to cater to this niche better or break into other target
demographics. Make a sample questionnaire out of this situation. Use the rubrics
in What's New to assess your questionnaire.</h2><br />

Based on what you learned in your English class, encircle the subject and underline the object in this sentence. Mary Rose threw the ball.2, In English, what is the difference between a Subject and an Object? Analyze this story and answer the questions that follow. Mr. Libangan is the Principal of Divine Temple Academy.  He has a problem with one of the teachers, Mrs. Javier.   Mrs. Javier is already 58 years old.  The retirement age for teachers is 60 so she can still teach for two more years.  For the past 25 years, she had been a model teacher who prepared excellent lessons, managed the class well and was very much loved by the students and her co-teachers.  But lately, Mrs. Javier’s age and health seem to be affecting her teaching.  She attends training but she cannot learn how to use technology in her class.  She still uses cartolina while all other teachers use laptops and E-tablets.  Her class gets bored.  She is also very forgetful lately.  One time, she forgot the test papers of the students in the cafeteria.  She did not know that many students were able to get a copy so many students got perfect scores in the test.  In another time, she was found sleeping in the faculty room when it was actually time for her class.  And just recently, she brought home the report cards of her class but left them in the bus.  As a result, the students’ cards were not given during the card distribution day.  The parents of the students got very angry and went to Mr. Libangan, demanding that Mrs. Javier be dismissed.  Mr. Libangan knows that Mrs. Javier is sorry for her mistakes and that she is still trying her best to become a good teacher.  But Mr. Libangan also knows that if he still allows Mrs. Javier to teach for two more years, more problems will arise and more parents would protest against her and might even sue the school.3, If you were Mr. Libangan, what will you do?  Why?  4,Talk with your seatmates, share your answer then come up with the best solution you can suggest to Mr. Libangan.  Write your revised answer here: ​</h2><br />
