                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

Ahmad aspires to be a football player, but his father forbids him from pursuing his dream, insisting that he should focus on his studies instead. Despite his father's disapproval, Ahmad remains determined to achieve his goal.</p><p></p><p>Characters:</p><p>The main character, Ahmad, is played by a young actor named Adib Kosnan. He effectively portrays the character's determination and passion for football. Ahmad's father, played by actor Tony Eusoff, is a strict and traditional man who believes that education is more important than sports.</p><p></p><p>Setting:</p><p>The film is set in a poor community in Singapore, where Ahmad and his family live in a small apartment. The setting contributes to the film by showing the challenges that Ahmad faces in pursuing his dream due to his family's financial struggles.</p><p></p><p>Lesson:</p><p>The film teaches us that we should pursue our dreams and passions, even if others discourage us from doing so.

It is also a good movie to watch with family and friends, as it can spark discussions about pursuing one's dreams and the importance of family support.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            18. liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</h2><br />

As a teacher, you want them to change their ways for the better. What will you do? How will you address the situation 3. How are rights related to responsibilities?pa help po salamat po ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The role of a GMRC teacher in assisting young people in exploring the influences of the family and other social institutions in the process of becoming the person they are now is crucial in providing them with an understanding of why they are the way they are. The family is the primary social institution where a child first experiences love, discipline, values, and beliefs. As such, it is necessary for young people to reflect on how their family and social surroundings have helped shape their identities. This requires the teacher to create an environment that promotes trust, openness, and critical thinking. </p><p></p><p>In exploring their family and social influences, the teacher must be careful not to pass judgment or impose their own values and beliefs on the students. Instead, they should encourage students to examine their own experiences and make their own conclusions. This can be done through various activities such as group discussions, journal writing, and reflective exercises. </p><p></p><p>In addition to exploring their familial and social influences, the teacher must also equip the students with life skills such as self-awareness, empathy, and conflict resolution. These skills will enable young people to navigate their relationships with others and make informed decisions in their lives. Ultimately, the role of the GMRC teacher is to empower young people to recognize their agency in shaping who they are and who they want to become. </p><p></p><p>2. When students display a lack of respect and courtesy for elders, it is important for the teacher to address the situation promptly and thoughtfully. The first step is to establish clear expectations for behavior in the classroom. This may involve setting rules and consequences for non-compliance. The teacher should also model respectful behavior towards the students and encourage them to do the same. </p><p></p><p>If a particular student continues to exhibit disrespectful behavior, the teacher should first speak with the student privately to understand the root of their behavior. It is possible that the student is dealing with personal issues that are impacting their behavior. In this case, the teacher should work with the student to identify support resources that can help address their issues. </p><p></p><p>If the student's behavior persists despite attempts to address it, the teacher may need to involve the student's parents or guardians. This can be done through a phone call or a meeting with the parents. The teacher should provide evidence of the behavior and their attempts to address it, and work collaboratively with the parents to find a solution. </p><p></p><p>In all cases, the teacher must remain calm and professional when addressing disrespectful behavior. They should avoid using punitive tactics and instead focus on creating a positive and supportive learning environment. </p><p></p><p>3. Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin; one cannot exist without the other. A right is a privilege granted to someone by law or social convention. It is something that everyone is entitled to regardless of their background or circumstances. Examples of rights are the right to education, freedom of speech, and the right to vote. </p><p></p><p>Responsibilities, on the other hand, are the duties and obligations that come with having certain rights. They are the actions that individuals must take to ensure that their rights are protected and that they do not infringe on the rights of others. For example, the responsibility of the right to education is to attend school, complete assignments, and respect teachers and fellow students. </p><p></p><p>Rights and responsibilities are interconnected because one cannot exercise their rights without taking responsibility for them, and vice versa. Failing to fulfill one's responsibilities can lead to the loss of rights, as seen in legal systems where criminals may lose their right to vote or own a firearm. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the relationship between rights and responsibilities is essential in promoting a just and equitable society. A society where individuals recognize and take responsibility for their rights promotes a culture of civic engagement and social responsibility.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Eating disorders are illnesses in which the people experience severe disturbances in their eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. People with eating disorders typically become pre-occupied with food and their body weight.
</p><p>
</p><p>Eating disorders affect several million people at any given time, most often women between the ages of 12 and 35. There are three main types of eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.
</p><p>
</p><p>People with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa tend to be perfectionists with low self-esteem and are extremely critical of themselves and their bodies. They usually “feel fat” and see themselves as overweight, sometimes even despite life-threatening semi-starvation (or malnutrition). An intense fear of gaining weight and of being fat may become all-pervasive. In early stages of these disorders, patients often deny that they have a problem.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
