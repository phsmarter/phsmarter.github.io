                                            Principle of Individual Differences The principle of individual differences simply means that, because we all are unique individuals, we will all have a slightly different response to an exercise program. This is another way of saving that one size does not fit all when it comes to exercise. Well-designed exercise programs should be based on our individual differences and responses to exercise. Some of these differences have to do with body size and shape. genetics, past experience, chronic conditions, injuries, and even gender. For example, women generally need more recovery time than men.' and older athletes generally need more recovery time than younger athletes Principle of Specificity We've all heard the phrase, "Practice makes perfect. Well, this is the Principle of Specificity in action. This principle simply states that exercising a certain body part or component of the body primarily develops that part. The principle of specificity implies that to become better at a particular exercise or skill, you must perform that exercise or skill. A ninner should train by running, a swimmer by swimming and a cyclist by cycling. While it's helpful to have a good base of fitness and to do general conditioning routines, if you want to be better at your sport, you need to train specifically for that sport Principle of Overload The exercise science principle of overload states that a greater than normal stress or load on the body is required for training adaptation to take place. What this means is that in order to improve our fitness, strength or endurance, we need to increase the workload accordingly In order for a muscle (including the heart) to increase strength, it must be gradually stressed by working against a load greater than it is accustomed to. For adaptation to occur the volume of exercise must overload the body in some way in line with the capacity of the individual to cope with that overload​</a>

Principle of Individual Differences The principle of individual differences simply means that, because we all are unique individuals, we will all have a slightly different response to an exercise program. This is another way of saving that one size does not fit all when it comes to exercise. Well-designed exercise programs should be based on our individual differences and responses to exercise. Some of these differences have to do with body size and shape. genetics, past experience, chronic conditions, injuries, and even gender. For example, women generally need more recovery time than men.' and older athletes generally need more recovery time than younger athletes Principle of Specificity We've all heard the phrase, "Practice makes perfect. Well, this is the Principle of Specificity in action. This principle simply states that exercising a certain body part or component of the body primarily develops that part. The principle of specificity implies that to become better at a particular exercise or skill, you must perform that exercise or skill. A ninner should train by running, a swimmer by swimming and a cyclist by cycling. While it's helpful to have a good base of fitness and to do general conditioning routines, if you want to be better at your sport, you need to train specifically for that sport Principle of Overload The exercise science principle of overload states that a greater than normal stress or load on the body is required for training adaptation to take place. What this means is that in order to improve our fitness, strength or endurance, we need to increase the workload accordingly In order for a muscle (including the heart) to increase strength, it must be gradually stressed by working against a load greater than it is accustomed to. For adaptation to occur the volume of exercise must overload the body in some way in line with the capacity of the individual to cope with that overload​</h2><br />
