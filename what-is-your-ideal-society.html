society?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Q1</p><p>To me, the world is a complicated place and today's standards of society make it even more difficult to live and act in one's own way.  I sometimes wonder what life would be like if we could start all over and build a brand new society - a society that guarantees social justice for all groups and full rights to every individual. From the beginning society has been judgmental in one way or another, rather it is through racism, sexism, or classicism.  </p><p></p><p>The roles of men and women have drastically altered the past century and men now take on some responsibilities that were once viewed as tasks of a woman.  As a result women have been able to advance their careers, express their political views, and have become equals next to men in society, which illustrates that had women not been discriminated against and viewed as the homemaker for so long, equality between men and women would have occurred ages ago.  In my vision of society an individual's sex would not inhibit one from fully participating in the activities of the community that he or she desired.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Q2.</p><p>Step back from a societal ideal and think of an individual ideal, and you will be on the right track, since any given society is composed of individuals and not a collective mind or hive mind. For an individual, his primary values ought to be reason, purpose, and self-esteem; and his virtues ought to be rationality, independence, honesty, productiveness, justice, pride, and integrity. These are the basic values and virtues that will lead to a man living his own life according to his own rational standards based on observation and context of his own making in coming to understand reality and what to do about the fact that he is alive and trying to do well. </p><br />

These towns would be pretty much equitably appropriated across the globe, approaching generally comparable measures of arable land. 30% of all land would be assigned wild, and no social orders would be permitted to colonize these regions, however withdrawn people would be allowed to possess the wild after a way of life of complete forlornness.

</p><p>While every general public would conclude its own guidelines, the Confederation would regard a widespread constitution as per which nobody can claim anything they have not made. Common items could be traded openly among people or between <strong>social</strong> orders. There would be no cash, and no storing of commonly possessed assets, on agony of expulsion to the wild. Consistently there would be a Global Festival of Gratitude and Giving, during which gifts would be unreservedly traded and craftsmanship, music, moves and games would celebrate and restore the opportunity of the Earth from human mastery.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Recent discussions of Jesus' social class try to locate him within the social structures of Mediterranean society generally, or Galilean society, in the first century. And there seems to be a debate among many contemporary scholars of Jesus as to whether he was really a peasant or... somewhat higher in the socio-economic strata. We know in general he was low class, by the standards of the Roman imperial aristocracy or even of the ruling class of Palestine, the Herodian client kings. But he may have been an artisan. He doesn't seem to have been a peasant in the strict sense, someone who was working the land for a living. He was close, however, to peasant society; all of the images in his parables and his aphorisms are firmly rooted in peasant society and call upon everyday things like a sower, or sowing seed. But they also call upon images of land owners and relationships between slave owners and slaves, masters and servants. So Jesus seems to have been aware of that level of the socio-economic mix. And he may well have stood in some relationship to it. So an artisan of some sort is probably the best way of describing him.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>An ideal society can be described as one that promotes the well-being and happiness of its citizens while upholding the principles of justice, equality, and individual freedom. In such a society, people are free to express their ideas, beliefs, and values without fear of persecution or discrimination. They are also encouraged to participate actively in the political process and have a voice in shaping the policies that affect their lives.</p><p></p><p>In an ideal society, education is accessible to all, and opportunities for personal growth and development are available to everyone regardless of their socio-economic background. This means that access to healthcare, employment, and affordable housing is guaranteed, and social safety nets are in place to support those who need it.</p><p></p><p>Another critical feature of an ideal society is the protection and preservation of the natural environment. This means that people are mindful of their ecological footprint and take measures to reduce their impact on the environment. Sustainability and conservation are prioritized, and policies are in place to promote the use of renewable resources and protect natural habitats and biodiversity.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, an ideal society values diversity and celebrates cultural differences. People from different backgrounds and ethnicities are respected and treated equally, and discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion is not tolerated.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, an ideal society is one that promotes the well-being of its citizens while upholding the principles of justice, equality, and individual freedom. It is a society that values education, personal growth, and the protection of the natural environment. It is also one that values diversity and celebrates cultural differences. While such a society may not be perfect, striving towards these ideals can lead to a more just, equitable, and sustainable future for all.</p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>

</p><p>The roles of men and women have drastically altered the past century and men now take on some responsibilities that were once viewed as tasks of a woman.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>The closest to perfection would be an interdependent Confederation of societies, each containing between one and two hundred citizens, depending upon factors such as location and climate. These villages would be more or less evenly distributed across the globe, having access to roughly equivalent amounts of arable land. Thirty per cent of all land would be designated wilderness, and no societies would be allowed to colonise these areas, but antisocial individuals would be free to inhabit the wilderness following a life-style of total lonesomeness.
</p><p>
</p><p>Each society would be run according to a consensus of members, on a Rousseauian model of full participation of all members over 14 and council decree. Dissenting members will be invited to move to alternative societies, set up their own on land proportionate to the size of the dissenting group, or to take to the wilderness. Councils may legislate on shared interests, but there will be no laws restricting private activities provided these do not infringe upon the same freedoms of others.
</p><p>
</p><p>Whilst each society would decide its own rules, the Confederation would respect a universal constitution according to which no-one can own anything they have not made. Communal products could be exchanged freely amongst individuals or between societies. There would be no money, and no hoarding of mutually-owned resources, on pain of banishment to the wilderness. Every year there would be a Global Festival of Gratitude and Giving, during which gifts would be freely exchanged and art, music, dances and games would celebrate and renew the freedom of the Earth from human domination.
</p><p>
</p><p>According to the constitution, animals culled from the wild may be eaten during the winter in cold climates and during illness. But there would be no domestication or other infringement upon the freedom of animals. Killing would be allowed only if human life is in danger, or to stabilize populations and environmental harmony. All waste would be recycled, and energy derived only from renewable sources such as wind and tide.
</p><p>
</p><p>If one society threatens aggression against another, the Global Confederation would boycott it for 50 years. Members would be invited to join alternative societies, but may emigrate only to one that has received no other members of the rogue society. All political relationships will be entirely internal to each society and there would be no alliances formed between societies. Societies attempting to form political allegiances or extend their power beyond their own members will be boycotted. Individuals would be free to travel to and form relationships with individuals of other societies, but any group growing too large for its arable resources would have to redistribute.</p><br />

Instead, we criticize everyone by their contribution to their community.<br /><br />5. Economy is much better. No capitalists exploiting human labors. No powerful or filthy rich people against minorities and against human rights.<br /><br />6. Mental health awareness is very important and is very common,<br /><br />7.
