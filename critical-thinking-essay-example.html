                                            "The Duplicate War: A Review" by David Lowe
Critique by Robert Keating
(1) The most valuable portion of any critique is "What I didn't like and why." (2) Unfortunately, there's not much
wrong with The Duplicate War: A Review. (3)I will try to be as specific as possible with my praise, so you'll know
what you did right.
(4) The vehicle of an opera review to tell your tale is an excellent one. (5)1 have seen this approach before, and it is
very effective as long as it keeps moving. (6) Your tale moved at a brisk (but not rushed) pace.
(7) "The photograph of his father in the wheelchair that had brought him back from Vietnam could be dusted..." (8)
The paragraph this line appears in is an excellent example of characterization by setting, and the line I referenced
is the wonderful little which completes the scene and sheds a little light on who Scott is.
(9) "The networks showed the tape over and over, he sat up drinking strong coffee and watched Michael every
hour until dawn." (10)I think that amending this line to end"... and watched Michael die every hour until dawn" will
add impact and help justify Scott's actions later.
(11) This is an excellent story and should see publication. (12) It is on par with what I see in the short science
fiction markets.

                            6. "The Duplicate War: A Review" by David Lowe
Critique by Robert Keating
(1) The most valuable portion of any critique is "What I didn't like and why." (2) Unfortunately, there's not much
wrong with The Duplicate War: A Review. (3)I will try to be as specific as possible with my praise, so you'll know
what you did right.
(4) The vehicle of an opera review to tell your tale is an excellent one. (5)1 have seen this approach before, and it is
very effective as long as it keeps moving. (6) Your tale moved at a brisk (but not rushed) pace.
(7) "The photograph of his father in the wheelchair that had brought him back from Vietnam could be dusted..." (8)

(9) "The networks showed the tape over and over, he sat up drinking strong coffee and watched Michael every
hour until dawn." (10)I think that amending this line to end"... and watched Michael die every hour until dawn" will
add impact and help justify Scott's actions later.
(11) This is an excellent story and should see publication. (12) It is on par with what I see in the short science
fiction markets.
