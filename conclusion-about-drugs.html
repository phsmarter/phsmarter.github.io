                                            Pa summarize po ng body and introduction para may malagay sa conclusion huhuhuThesis statement: Drug abuse is a complex disease that needs enduring and extensive treatment. People who have struggled with substance abuse have often found it extremely difficult to quit due to the physical and/or mental addiction.BODYDo you or someone you know have a drug problem?people from all walks of life can experience problems with their drug use, regardless of age,race background, or the reason they started using drugs in the first place. Some people experiment with recreational drugs cut of curiosity, to have a good time, because friends are doing it, or to ease problems such as stress, anxiety, or depression.INTROWhen drug use becomes drug abuse or addictionOf course,drug use -either illegal or prescription - doesn't automatically lead to abuse. Some people are able to use recreational or prescription drugs without experiencing negative effects, while others find that substance use takes a serious toll on their health and well being similarly, there is no specific point at which drug use moves from casual to problematicDrug abuse and addiction is less about the type or amount of the substance consumed or the frequency of your drug use, and more about the consequences of that drug use. If your drug use is causing problems in your life—at work, school, home, or in your relationships—you likely have a drug abuse or addiction problem.If you’re worried about your own or a loved one’s drug use, learning how drug abuse and addiction develops—and why it can have such a powerful hold—will give you a better understanding of how to best deal with the problem and regain control of your life. Recognizing that you have a problem is the first step on the road to recovery, one that takes tremendous courage and strength. Facing your problem without minimizing the issue or making excuses can feel frightening and overwhelming, but recovery is within reach. If you're ready to seek help, you can overcome your addiction and build a satisfying, drug-free life for yourself​</a>

                                            7. Researchers conducted an experiment to identify the effects of three different hand sanitizers on the growth of bacteria. The researchers grew one type of bacteria in twenty-four identical covered petri dishes. Then, they opened eighteen petri dishes and applied the three hand sanitizers to six petri dishes each. They left the remaining six petri dishes closed as a control group. When the researchers measured the growth of bacteria two days later, the six dishes that had no hand sanitizer showed the least amount of bacterial growth. The researchers concluded that not using any hand sanitizer would lead to the least bacterial growth. 
Which statement best explains why the researchers’ conclusion was not justified?
A. The experiment tested too many variables.
B. The control group was not treated the same as the experimental group.
C. The sample size of twenty-four petri dishes is not large enough.
D. The single type of bacteria is not adequate to make any conclusions.
8. In double-blind studies neither the test subject or the researcher knows who was given the drug and who was given the control. Why are these studies effective for testing a drug that may elevate mood and relieve feelings of depression? 
A. Since there are two symptoms that are affected, a double-blind study is required.
B. Double-blind studies are ways to ensure that only the researcher can figure out who is getting the effective drug.
C. Double-blind studies are the most economical way to gather results from testing on humans.
D. The patients and researchers are not given this information so they cannot be influenced in reporting the effectiveness

Write your answers in your notebook Modern Generation Youth Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modem generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc Today's youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" is the opinion of majority of the elderly people They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcoho smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general They feel that there should be a certain kind of decencyin their code of dressing be it at home, college workplace or the church temple mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent cause they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society By this 1 mean it is the youth who can implement the aws and make the required changes To bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands.1.

In addition, within the first quarter of his rule, Duterte made derogatory comments about US President Barack Obama, the Pope, the European Union, and the United Nations._______2. Also, to the horror of many observers around the world, Duterte committed himself to extinguishing drug addicts in the Philippines on the same scale as the Holocaust_______3. At the same time, he expressed his admiration for Adolf Hitler._______4. In conclusion, Award-winning investigative journalist Sheila S. Coronel’s essayunravels the “No Man’s Land where policing and criminality become indistinguishable” (168). In this uncharted territory of “extortion, theft, abduction, and murder in which the police are both enforcers of the law and its worst offenders,” the police emerge as “entrepreneurs looking formaximum gain” (189)._______5. To begin with, in June 2016, Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines. He was the first politician from Mindanao to claim the seat at Malacañang Palace. He vowed to “kill them all,” alluding to anyone involved in the trade and consumption of drugs. He promised that the fish in Manila Bay would fatten up from feeding off the bodies of drug addicts that would be dumped into the water.​</a>

                                            As a logical Person I know that the author has a point in promoting the legalization of marijuana however our new presidents doesnt want that because he might not know the extraction of a chemical composition of marijuana which means we can take out the bad stuff in canabis and keep the helpful chemicals. In other branches of hospitals here in the Philippines they have message about the acceptance or legalization of marijuana here in the Philippines as a medical herb that can help various diseases like Alzheimer’s, loss of appetite on chemotherapy and even HIV and AIDS. Which was said in the essay but not all. The lack of information in the essay was only the problem and questions pops in my heads that never gets unswared likeIs marijuana the only drug that can be extracted to make essential medicine for any other various diseases?If it were to be implemented, where should this plantations start and how should it be not accessible to the society? Due to the un answered questions that I have read and now think mymind changed because I remember that even though marijuana can be used essentially, it is still a dangerous drug and can cause total or even global chaos if it were to be a huge impact to the global society.pa gawa nga ito essay1st introduction 2nd body3rd conclusion ​</a>

Pa summarize po ng body and introduction para may malagay sa conclusion huhuhuThesis statement: Drug abuse is a complex disease that needs enduring and extensive treatment. People who have struggled with substance abuse have often found it extremely difficult to quit due to the physical and/or mental addiction.BODYDo you or someone you know have a drug problem?people from all walks of life can experience problems with their drug use, regardless of age,race background, or the reason they started using drugs in the first place. Some people experiment with recreational drugs cut of curiosity, to have a good time, because friends are doing it, or to ease problems such as stress, anxiety, or depression.INTROWhen drug use becomes drug abuse or addictionOf course,drug use -either illegal or prescription - doesn't automatically lead to abuse. Some people are able to use recreational or prescription drugs without experiencing negative effects, while others find that substance use takes a serious toll on their health and well being similarly, there is no specific point at which drug use moves from casual to problematicDrug abuse and addiction is less about the type or amount of the substance consumed or the frequency of your drug use, and more about the consequences of that drug use. If your drug use is causing problems in your life—at work, school, home, or in your relationships—you likely have a drug abuse or addiction problem.If you’re worried about your own or a loved one’s drug use, learning how drug abuse and addiction develops—and why it can have such a powerful hold—will give you a better understanding of how to best deal with the problem and regain control of your life. Recognizing that you have a problem is the first step on the road to recovery, one that takes tremendous courage and strength. Facing your problem without minimizing the issue or making excuses can feel frightening and overwhelming, but recovery is within reach. If you're ready to seek help, you can overcome your addiction and build a satisfying, drug-free life for yourself​</h2><br />
                        CONCLUSION<br />Drug abuse is a serious problem that is recognized by people from all walks of life. People who abuse drugs often experience physical and/or mental addiction, making it difficult to quit. However, it is possible to overcome drug abuse and addiction with the right help and support. Recognizing the problem and having the courage to seek help is the first step on the road to recovery and a healthier, drug-free life.<p>Summarize of Body:</p><p></p>People of all ages, backgrounds, and reasons for using drugs can develop problems with drug use. Some people use drugs recreationally, while others may use them to cope with stress, anxiety, or depression. It is possible for anyone to develop a drug problem.<p></p><p>Summarize of Intro:</p><p></p>Drug abuse and addiction is not determined by the type or amount of the substance used or the frequency of drug use, but rather by the consequences of that drug use. If drug use is causing problems in a person's life, such as at work, school, or in relationships, it may be a sign of drug abuse or addiction. Recognizing that there is a problem is the first step towards recovery, and seeking help is necessary to overcome addiction and build a drug-free life.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The modem generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc Today's youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" is the opinion of majority of the elderly people They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcoho smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general They feel that there should be a certain kind of decencyin their code of dressing be it at home, college workplace or the church temple mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students.

                            15. persuasive essay about War on drugs (introduction, body, conclusion)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The War on Drugs is a global campaign that aims to eliminate the use and distribution of illegal drugs. This campaign is being implemented in many countries around the world, including the United States. The goal of the War on Drugs is to reduce drug abuse and addiction rates, prevent drug-related crimes, and increase public safety. However, despite the efforts of governments, this campaign has been criticized for its negative effects on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. In this essay, I will argue that the War on Drugs is a flawed campaign that has failed to achieve its goals and has caused more harm than good.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Firstly, the War on Drugs has failed to reduce drug use and addiction rates. Despite the billions of dollars spent on drug control and prevention programs, drug abuse and addiction rates continue to rise. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 19.3 million Americans aged 12 or older were current illicit drug users in 2020, representing 7.4% of the population. This suggests that the War on Drugs has been ineffective in addressing the root causes of drug abuse and addiction.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the War on Drugs has led to the criminalization and stigmatization of drug users, particularly those from marginalized communities. Instead of treating drug addiction as a public health issue, the War on Drugs has focused on punishing drug users and dealers, which has resulted in mass incarceration, police brutality, and human rights abuses. Moreover, drug laws are often enforced in a discriminatory manner, with people of color and low-income individuals being disproportionately targeted and penalized.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, the War on Drugs has fueled violence and corruption, particularly in countries where drug production and trafficking are prevalent. Drug cartels and organized crime groups have emerged as powerful forces, using violence and intimidation to maintain their dominance over the drug trade. This has not only caused harm to individuals and communities but also undermined the rule of law and democratic institutions.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, the War on Drugs is a failed campaign that has caused more harm than good. Its focus on punishment and prohibition has not only failed to reduce drug use and addiction rates but also led to the criminalization and stigmatization of drug users, violence, and corruption. Instead of continuing with the failed policies of the War on Drugs, governments should adopt evidence-based approaches that prioritize harm reduction, public health, and human rights. This includes investing in drug treatment and prevention programs, legalizing and regulating drugs, and addressing the social and economic factors that contribute to drug abuse and addiction.</p><br />

                            16. As a logical Person I know that the author has a point in promoting the legalization of marijuana however our new presidents doesnt want that because he might not know the extraction of a chemical composition of marijuana which means we can take out the bad stuff in canabis and keep the helpful chemicals. In other branches of hospitals here in the Philippines they have message about the acceptance or legalization of marijuana here in the Philippines as a medical herb that can help various diseases like Alzheimer’s, loss of appetite on chemotherapy and even HIV and AIDS. Which was said in the essay but not all. The lack of information in the essay was only the problem and questions pops in my heads that never gets unswared likeIs marijuana the only drug that can be extracted to make essential medicine for any other various diseases?If it were to be implemented, where should this plantations start and how should it be not accessible to the society? Due to the un answered questions that I have read and now think mymind changed because I remember that even though marijuana can be used essentially, it is still a dangerous drug and can cause total or even global chaos if it were to be a huge impact to the global society.pa gawa nga ito essay1st introduction 2nd body3rd conclusion ​</h2><br />
