                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Subject Matter: Oskar Kokoschka's "Bride of the Wind" depicts a woman in a white dress standing in a boat with a sail billowing behind her. The other figures in the artwork include a man and a woman, both with their backs to the viewer, and a small child with its back to the woman.</p><p></p><p>Materials: The painting is oil on canvas. The use of oil paints allows for the artist to create a strong contrast between the light and the dark, which draws the viewer's attention to the central figure of the woman.</p><p></p><p>The Art, Elements and Principles: The dominant elements of the painting are the contrast between light and dark and the strong lines used to define the shapes and volumes of the figures. The unifying features of the composition are the repetition of curves and the use of light to create a sense of movement and energy.</p><p></p><p>Analysis: The painting conveys the feeling of movement, freedom and possibility. The contrast between the light and dark creates a strong visual impact, while the strong lines and curves used to define the figures' shapes and volumes give the painting a sense of energy and movement. The use of oil paints also brings out the artist's intended effect of creating a sense of atmosphere and mood.</p><p></p><p>Interpretation: The painting conveys a message of hope and freedom. The woman in the boat is the central figure, who is setting off on a journey of discovery and freedom. The two figures with their backs to the viewer represent the past, while the small child symbolizes new beginnings and possibilities. Overall, the painting conveys the idea that although the path ahead may be uncertain, the journey is worth taking.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.	The artist emphasized the face of Sabel, which is plain but full of emotions. He made use of primary and bright colors contrasted with a dark background directing the eyes of the viewers to Sabel’s face. At first look, the work has an impression of grief, loneliness, and madness. The lines are geometric and abstracted, arranged in a diagonal and curvilinear manner. The curvilinear lines give an affective, natural feeling. On the other hand, the geometric and abstracted lines present a rhythmic feeling as portrayed by the white blanket in the image.2.	There are soft lines that help create tenderness and warmth in the painting, as seen in Sabel’s hair and in her red blanket. The diagonal lines provide spontaneity because they stimulate calmness.  3. Ben Cabrera’s Magnum Opus is Sabel paintings. But these paintings evoke loneliness. The most distinguishable feature that captured Sabel’s emotions is her eyes that have an intensity in them.  BenCab has perfectly portrayed the sentiment of Sabel which is passed to the viewers where they can relate to. While observing it even more closely, the artist himself is trying to convey while feeling lonesome and insanity, one can also achieve calmness.</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p>brainly.ph/question/5545964</p><p></p><br />

How can your knowledge of the elements and principles of art help you in appreciating the mural painting of Carlos “Botong” Francisco entitled Bayanihan?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1. A visual artwork has movement, of course. </strong>The dance itself is an artistic expression primarily based on movement. Movement is also used in visual art but in a unique way. The illusion of action in a work of art is achieved through the artistic principle of visible movement. Any part of a composition, or the complete thing, can undergo motion.</p><p>The visual aspects of art, including colour, line, texture, shape, form, value, and space, can convey the sense of motion in a work of art. Incorporating these components in various configurations allows for a wide range of possible motion.</p><p>The artist uses the principle of movement to lead the viewer's eye into, around, and out of work.</p><p><strong>2. Harmony in art generally is created when an artwork's elements merge coherently.</strong> Some details can be reused without losing their cohesiveness overall. Neither monotony nor anarchy characterizes harmony. The two go together so well.</p><p>There are various ways of expressing harmony. Use colour as a medium, and create a balance between the marks and the shapes you paint.</p><p><strong>3. Carlos Francisco created several works, one of which is titled Bayanihan. The artwork titled Bayanihan, which translates to "becoming a bayan," is often used to symbolize a strong sense of solidarity and collaboration among members of a community. </strong></p><p>The Tagalog word "bayan," which means "nation," "town," or "community," is the source of the Filipino custom known as Bayanihan (buy-uh-nee-hun). The Filipino concept of "bayanihan," or "being in a bayan," is central to Filipino identity since it emphasizes the importance of community and cooperation.</p><p>Carlos Francisco's prints and, later, more personal paintings epitomize Romanticism's emphasis on the individual, the subjective, the imaginative, and the emotional.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about other art:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/17722223</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><p>​</p><br />
