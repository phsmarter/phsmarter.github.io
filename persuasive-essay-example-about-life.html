                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Persuasive point 1: Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 2: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate; it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 3 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 4 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism, then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 5 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching Set A, Directions.

Sarita How would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years. I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best; so much glee and serenity 1.

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just leaning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our socie:ty is the fact that it helps people learn how to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to learn" things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children's lives by not vaccinating them, and walk smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. ​</a>

If given a chance I would go back to me childhood years I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on ou faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

Sarita How would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years. I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best; so much glee and serenity 1.

                            7. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just leaning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our socie:ty is the fact that it helps people learn how to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to learn" things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children's lives by not vaccinating them, and walk smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. ​</h2><br />

If given a chance I would go back to me childhood years I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on ou faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best so much glee and serenity Questions 1. What is the sentence that shows how the author feel about the topic? 2. What are the reasons of the author about the topic? 3. What are the sentences that show examples that prove why the author is right? 4. How did the author state the reasons and examples?

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories.

SaritaHow would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years.I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow.Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being achild also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best; so much glee and serenity.Questions:What is the sentence that shows how the author feel about the topic? 2.

                            16. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Why is Education Important in Our Society:<p>One of the benefits of education is that the educational system teaches us how to obtain and develop critical and logical thinking and make independent decisions. When children become adults, they are faced with a lot of challenging issues – pay off your student loans, get a job, buy a car and a house, provide for your family, etc. However, if one has spent years educating themselves, they should be able to make sound decisions on these various quandaries. Not only are people able to form their own opinions, but they are also good at finding solid and reliable arguments and evidence to back up and confirm their decisions. !!</p><br />
