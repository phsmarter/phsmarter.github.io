                        <p><strong>MassKara Festival is alternately known as the ‘festival of smiles’ due to the tradition of the masks that the people wear donning smiles to represent the message of happiness. Because of the festival, Bacolod is also designated as the ‘City of Smiles’. The festival still today represents a time of the year when the people can take their sadness or any pain that they are experiencing and ‘throw it away’ as they did all those years ago when it first began. This is their new beginning or a fresh start. It is boasted as a magnificent sight to see and something that everyone should try to experience at some point. It is also touted as the longest festival being a month in duration in which there are multiple celebrations, parties, gatherings in honor of the theme.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The MassKara Festival is a beautiful, symbolic gesture of the type of resiliency the people of Bacolod hold. Flights from Manila to Bacolod may be difficult to get during that time of the year with the popularity of the festival. It is certainly worth a try to book well enough ahead of time that you get to see such an amazing event.</strong></p><br />

                        <p></p><p>Bac-bacarra Festival (Fish Baskets)</p><p>This celebration was started in the year 2005 as a revival and preservation of their cultural heritage. The legendary bac-bacarra is a freshwater fish abundant in the rivers of the town in the olden days. It is now extinct. The town’s name was derived from it. It was coined by a Spanish soldier who passed by. He asked the name of the place from a local who at that time was fishing. He did not understand his question and just answered bac-bacarra.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Fishing is the main industry in the town attributed to the presence of coastline and the Bacarra river where they get good catch of quality and high valued fish products. They owe the blessings they receive to their patron Saint Andrew the Fisherman. This celebration serves as a thanksgiving to the abundant fish catches. The highlight of the said event is the street dancing depicting the history of the town and fishing itself. In general it was not that exciting as compared to other festival celebrations because there were only nine groups of young boys and girls who participated.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ikaw na magtranslate mo naman kung pagtratranslate lng dimo pa kaya </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>It is a colorful festival celebrated on the island of Marinduque in the Philippines. The participants use morion masks to depict the Roman soldiers and Syrian mercenaries within the story of the Passion of the Christ. The mask was named after the 16th and 17th century Morion helmet.[2] The Moriones refers to the masked and costumed penitents who march around the town for seven days searching for Longinus. Morions roam the streets in town from Holy Monday to Easter Sunday scaring the kids, or engaging in antics or surprises to draw attention. This is a folk-religious festival that re-enacts the story of Saint Longinus, a Roman centurion who was blind in one eye. <p></p><br />

The festivity was originally a pagan celebration to commemorate the Barter of Panay, where the Aeta accepted gifts from Bornean chieftains called Datu, who fled with their families to escape a tyrannical ruler, in exchange for being allowed to dwell in the Aeta’s lands. They celebrated with dancing and music, with the Borneans having painted their bodies with soot to show their gratefulness and camaraderie with the Aeta who had dark skin. Later on, the festivity was given a different meaning by the church by celebrating the acceptance of Christianity, as symbolized by carrying an image of the Holy Child or Infant Jesus during the procession</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps^^</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Festivals are public events celebrated or held either for religious reasons or secular purposes. The activities often involve carefully planned programs or ceremonies, outpourings of admiration, rejoicing, or high revelry. In many cases, especially in pious societies, traditional secular celebrations normally include a religious service.</p><p></p><p>But secular celebrations, as distinguished from religious observances, are not centered on the holy significance of the event. In a general sense, a secular festival is held purposely as a public honoring of outstanding persons, or to commemorate important historical or cultural events, or to re-create cherished folkways.</p><p></p><p>The origin of communal celebration is a matter of assumption among scholars. Folklorists believe that the first festivals arose because of the anxieties of early peoples who did not understand the forces of nature and wished to conciliate with them. The most ancient festivals were associated with planting and harvest times or with honoring the dead.</p><p></p><p>There is general agreement that festivals came about as man's way of communicating with divine beings and are, therefore, originally religious in nature. But as these celebrations became a fixture in man's way of life, they soon took on dimensions other than religious. Many have continued into the modern times as secular festivals-still with some religious overtones, but only as a matter of historical connection.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Sinulog festival is one of the grandest, most distinguished and most colorful festivals in the Philippines. The major festival is held each year on the third Sunday of January in Cebu City to honor the Santo Niño, or the child Jesus, who used to be the patron saint of the whole province of Cebu (since in the Catholic faith Jesus is not a saint, but God). It is fundamentally a dance ritual which remembers the Filipino people's pagan past and their recognition of Christianity.</p><p></p><p>The festival features some the country's most colorful displays of ceremony and pageantry: participants clothe in bright-colored costumes dance to the rhythm of drums and native gongs. The streets are generally lined with vendors and pedestrians all wanting to witness the street-dancing. Smaller versions of the festival are also held in different parts of the province, also to celebrate and honor the Santo Niño. There is also a Sinulog sa Kabataan, which is performed by the youths of Cebu a week before the Grand Parade.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the cultural event has been commercialized as a tourist attraction and instead of traditional street-dancing from locals, Sinulog also came to mean a contest highlighting groups from various parts of the country. The Sinulog Contest is traditionally held in the Cebu City Sports Complex, where most of Cebu's major provincial events are held.</p><p></p><p>The celebration traditionally lasts for nine days, ending on the ninth day when the Sinulog Grand Parade reveals. The day before the parade, the Fluvial Procession, a water-parade, held at dawn from the Mandaue City wharf to Cebu City wharf with the Santo Niño carried on a pump boat decorated with hundreds of flowers and candles. The procession ends at the Basilica where a re-enactment of the Christianizing of Cebu follows. In the afternoon, a more formal procession takes place along the major streets of the city, which last for hours due to large crowd participating in the religious event.</p><p></p><p>On the feast day, at the Basilica, a Pontifical Mass is held, given by the Cardinal with the assistance of several bishops of Cebu. The majority of the city’s population and devotees would flock to the Basilica to attend the mass before heading out to the streets to watch the Parade.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Ati-Atihan Festival is a Philippine festival held annually in January in honor of the Santo Niño (Holy Child or Infant Jesus) in several towns of the province of Aklan, Panay Island. The biggest celebration is held during the third Sunday of January in the town of Kalibo, the province’s capital. The name Ati-Atihan means "to imitate Ati", the local name of the Aeta people, the first settlers of Panay Island and other parts of the archipelago.

They celebrated with dancing and music, with the Borneans having painted their bodies with soot to show their gratefulness and camaraderie with the Aeta who had dark skin. Later on, the festivity was given a different meaning by the church by celebrating the acceptance of Christianity, as symbolized by carrying an image of the Holy Child or Infant Jesus during the procession</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps </p><br />
