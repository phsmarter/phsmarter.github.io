                                            Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                                            Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants?                            Excerpt from an essay written by Kris GledhillAfter England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day" Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people.Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method"Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee.So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing.In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included.We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene?Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures" The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal.1. What is the editorial's main point?2. Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.3.

Then also try to imagine how life was like 10 decades ago. differences would surely be astonishing. Not long ago, many of the technologies that we are enjoying now sounded too good to be true. Often, people thought that these technologies belong to the realm of science fiction movies and novels. But what turned these technologies into a reality is the insatiable thirst for knowledge that we, humans, specifically scientists, have. It is this thirst for knowledge that drove scientists and researchers to develop a specific discipline for different scientific queries. Sometimes, these disciplines overlap and give room for a collaborative discipline. Let's consider the fields of spectroscopy and photography, The principles in these two different fields were used to create spectral imaging The same thirst for knowledge also led scientists and researchers to exert extraordinary efforts just to understand a phenomenon, a species, or a scientific event, Lake forume howa group ofresearcherstock measures to study superbolt Sometimes thisthistorie guides us in understanding possible threats to our day to day use Understanding what superbelts are can help us determine when and we they occur and prevent them from causing irreparable damage tous Our thirst for knowledge is indeed what brought us to where we right now and where we will be the future B.

Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</a>

                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

                                            C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>- Drama is life with the enjoyable aspects cut out. Everyone experiences peaks and troughs in life. If we're in pain, it is difficult to remain positive and calm. Life isn't always a perfectly fine. We just had to deal with a lot of stuff that we don't want to interact with. We are confronted with various situations that make us want to give up. Nevertheless, life is about fulfilling obligations. Life is about gaining knowledge from our failures and doing the proper thing. We must keep going to do our better, and our mistakes will inevitably lead us to the proper path.

                            7. Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                            14. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants?                            Excerpt from an essay written by Kris GledhillAfter England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day" Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people.Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method"Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee.So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing.In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included.We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene?Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures" The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal.1. What is the editorial's main point?2. Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.3.

4. How does the bill of rights of article 3 of the 1987 constitution affect you as an individual and your family as a whole.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The recognition of human rights is important to uphold the values of fairness, respect and dignity for each individual, regardless of culture, ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, or age. Human rights are granted to ensure that all individuals are treated with respect and allowed the same opportunity to thrive. The recognition of human rights is necessary to protect individuals from violations of their rights, including physical and sexual abuse, discrimination, denial of basic needs, unrestricted migration, and oppression. It is also essential to maintain international stability and to preserve peace and security between nations.</p><p></p><p>2. There is a strong relationship between religion and human rights in that many religious teachings emphasize the importance of respecting individual rights and treating others with respect and compassion. The teachings of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, for example, all emphasize that people should strive to treat others with dignity and utmost respect. This can be seen in the Golden Rule: "love your neighbor as yourself." In addition, many religious systems recognize the inherent rights of individuals to free speech, religious practice, and self-determination, which are also human rights recognized in modern legal systems.</p><p></p><p>3. The Golden Rule is an ethical principle that provides an invaluable lesson on how to treat others: to treat others as you would want them to treat you. This simple rule can be found in many religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. It is commonly expressed as “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” and encourages people to act in the same manner that they would want others to act towards them. The importance of this rule lies in the fact that it involves taking into consideration the feelings of others and being considerate towards them, instead of simply doing whatever you want.</p><p></p><p>As an example of the Golden Rule, consider the following scenario: imagine you are walking down the street, and you notice someone in need of assistance. If you applied the Golden Rule in this situation, you would stop and take the time to help the person, considering that if the situation was reversed, you would expect someone else to help you. By treating others kindly and lending a helping hand when necessary, you will experience the rewards of showing and receiving kindness.</p><p></p><p>4. Article 3 of the 1987 Constitution states that the Filipino people have certain unalienable rights, and that protecting and promoting these rights is the duty of the government. This includes the right to life and liberty, the right to due process and protection from arbitrary arrest and punishment, the right to freedom of speech and assembly, the right to vote, the right to education, and the right to property and security. </p><p></p><p>For individual citizens and families, this means that these rights are guaranteed to them and should not be violated. This provides families with security and assurance that the government is looking out for their best interests. For example, the right to vote ensures that individuals and families have a say in choosing their leaders, which can have a direct impact on their lives. The right to due process gives individuals a fair trial, allowing them to hear the charges against them and have the opportunity to defend themselves in court. These rights also ensure better protection from discrimination, oppression, and arbitrary punishment. In essence, Article 3 of the 1987 Constitution provides legal protection to individuals and their families, allowing them to live and flourish in a stable and just environment.</p><br />

Often, people thought that these technologies belong to the realm of science fiction movies and novels. But what turned these technologies into a reality is the insatiable thirst for knowledge that we, humans, specifically scientists, have. It is this thirst for knowledge that drove scientists and researchers to develop a specific discipline for different scientific queries. Sometimes, these disciplines overlap and give room for a collaborative discipline.

                            22. Activity 1Directions. Write the expressions which signal causes and effects in the essay belowWhy Do People Keep Pets?manytypesWhat are pets? Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</h2><br />

                            23. THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF OPINION AND EXPRESSION 
Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regardless of 
sexual orientation or gender identity. This includes the expression of identity 
or personhood through speech, deportment, dress, bodily characteristics, choice 
of name, or any other means, as well as the freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, including with regard to human rights, 
sexual orientation and gender identity, through any medium and regardless of 
frontiers.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The preceding paragraph emphasizes the right to freedom of expression regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. It emphasizes that everyone has the right to express their identity or personhood in whatever way they see fit, whether through speech, dress, bodily characteristics, name choice, or other means. It also emphasizes the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of any kind, including those concerning human rights, sexual orientation, and gender identity, via any medium and without restriction.</p><p>This right is critical in ensuring that people have the freedom to express themselves without fear of repression or discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is significant because it ensures that individuals can freely express their ideas and opinions, challenge discrimination, and promote human rights. This right contributes to the growth of a diverse and inclusive society in which everyone's opinions and expressions are valued.</p><p>Freedom of expression is critical to the development of a democratic society. It enables people to express themselves, participate in public debate, and hold those in power accountable. The ability to freely express oneself contributes to the creation of an environment in which ideas can be shared and individuals can learn from one another. It also promotes social cohesion and mutual respect and understanding.</p><p>To summarize, the right to freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that must be protected and upheld. It is critical in combating discrimination and ensuring that individuals have the freedom to express their identity and personhood without fear of repression. The freedom to seek, receive, and disseminate information and ideas is also critical in constructing a diverse and inclusive society. As a result, it is critical to promote and protect this right in order to ensure that everyone's ideas and expressions are valued and respected.</p><p></p><br />

   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay:</p><p></p><p>1. Three Generations of Human Rights</p><p></p><p>Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that every individual is entitled to, simply because they are human beings. These rights have been categorized into three generations based on the time period and the focus of the rights.</p><p></p><p>First Generation: Civil and Political Rights</p><p>The first generation of human rights includes civil and political rights, which were first recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person, freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and association, as well as the right to a fair trial and freedom from torture, slavery, and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>Second Generation: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</p><p>The second generation of human rights emerged in the mid-20th century and focused on economic, social, and cultural rights. These rights include the right to education, work, social security, healthcare, and a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of the individual and their family.</p><p></p><p>Third Generation: Collective Rights</p><p>The third generation of human rights arose in the latter half of the 20th century and focuses on collective rights. These include the right to peace, a clean and healthy environment, and the right to self-determination of peoples and their cultures.</p><p></p><p>2. Sources of Human Rights Law in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Constitution and laws are the primary sources of human rights law in the Philippines. The 1987 Constitution specifically enumerates the civil and political rights, as well as economic, social, and cultural rights of all Filipino citizens. The Bill of Rights, in particular, outlines the fundamental rights of individuals and imposes limitations on the power of the state to ensure the protection of these rights.</p><p></p><p>International law is also a source of human rights law in the Philippines. The Philippines has ratified several international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. These treaties have become part of Philippine law and are recognized as sources of human rights law.</p><p></p><p>3. Personal Opinion on Human Rights Issues in our Country</p><p></p><p>As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions. However, I can provide a general statement on human rights issues in the Philippines. Despite the existence of laws and treaties protecting human rights, violations of these rights still occur in the Philippines. Human rights abuses such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture continue to be reported. There is a need for the government to uphold its commitment to protecting and promoting human rights and for individuals to be aware of their rights and actively advocate for them.</p><br />

                            27. Answer the following questions using own words "ESSAY"
1. What are the three views on human rights, what do you think is the most applicable in today's Philippine society?
2. In your own words, discuss how these views are observed in modern Philippine society.
A. Western views of human rights
B. Socialist view of human rights
C. Religious view of human rights</h2><br />
                        <p>1) Human rights are considered as the basic rights and freedoms that every person is entitled to, simply because they are human beings. These rights are considered inherent to human beings and are believed to be universal, inalienable, and indivisible. There are three main views on human rights: the Western view, the Socialist view, and the Religious view.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the most applicable view of human rights in today's Philippine society, it is difficult to determine a single view that is most applicable. Each view has its strengths and weaknesses and can be applied to different situations and issues. The most important thing is to recognize and promote the universality and indivisibility of all human rights, whether civil and political, economic, social, or cultural. It is also essential to respect and protect the rights of all individuals, especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized, regardless of their background, religion, or political beliefs. A comprehensive and balanced approach that recognizes the interdependence of all human rights is necessary to promote social justice and human dignity in Philippine society.</p><p></p><p>2) The Western view of human rights is based on the idea of individualism and liberalism, which emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and freedom from state interference. This view prioritizes civil and political rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, and the right to vote and participate in government. The Western view is typically associated with capitalist societies and is widely accepted in the Western world.</p><p></p><p>The Socialist view of human rights, on the other hand, is rooted in the principles of collectivism and socialism. It emphasizes the importance of economic, social, and cultural rights such as the right to work, education, healthcare, and a decent standard of living. The Socialist view also prioritizes collective rights and considers the state responsible for providing these rights to its citizens.</p><p></p><p>The Religious view of human rights is based on the idea that human beings are created by God and therefore have inherent dignity and worth. This view emphasizes the importance of moral and ethical values and promotes the protection of human life and dignity. The Religious view also considers the family and community as essential elements of society and prioritizes the rights of the vulnerable and marginalized.</p><p></p><p>In the Philippines, all three views of human rights have been observed in modern society. The Western view is evident in the country's Constitution, which guarantees civil and political rights to all citizens. The right to free speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to vote are all protected under the law. However, these rights are not always fully realized due to issues such as political repression, censorship, and violence against political activists and journalists.</p><p></p><p>The Socialist view is also observed in modern Philippine society, particularly in the government's efforts to promote social welfare programs and poverty reduction. The government provides subsidies for basic necessities, such as housing, healthcare, and education, and implements programs to address unemployment and poverty. However, the implementation of these programs has been criticized for being insufficient and ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the Religious view of human rights is widely embraced in Philippine society, where religion plays a significant role in people's lives. The Catholic Church, in particular, is influential in promoting moral and ethical values and advocating for the protection of human life and dignity. The Church is also active in providing humanitarian aid and social services to vulnerable and marginalized communities.</p><p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />

                            30. C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1. What is the editorial’s main point? 2. Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples. 3. How would you describe the editorial board’s argument? 4. Comment on the language and words used in the reading material. 5. Were you persuaded to believe the claims by the material’s ideas? Why or why not? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p>1.	What is the editorial’s main point?  <p>The central point of the editorial is to question whether United Kingdom should be accounted for causing the rising of cases and deaths due to COVID19. Although they are among the countries who have launched the vaccination drive, the new variant has originated from their country.  </p><p>
</p>2.	Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.  Among these evidences are;
<p>a.	UK’s premature lifting of COVID19 protocols
</p><p>b.	UK failed the rising cases and number of deaths immediately
</p><p>c.	They reopened without thinking that not all Britons are vaccinated and thus exposing them even further.  </p><p>
</p>3.	How would you describe the editorial board’s argument?  <p>The editorial board’s argument are counterintuitive yet informative. However, it is obviously not siding the UK government and that is Boris Johnson.  </p>4.	Comment on the language and words used in the reading material.  <p>The language and choice words are not that hard to understand. Although there are technical terms, the context clues were a large help to get the whole picture of a sentence.  </p><p>
</p>5.	Were you persuaded to believe the claims by the material’s ideas? Why or why not?  <p>Yes, because a lot facts and evidences were presented. Other than that, it sounded persuasive. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/21873944</p><br />
