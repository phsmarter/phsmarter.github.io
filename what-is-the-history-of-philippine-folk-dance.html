At noontime the peasants gather to eat their lunch together and to rest.  During this rest period Tiklos music is played with a flute accompanied by a guitar and the guimbal or tambora (drums).   The peasants then dance; thus, the Tiklos has evolved.</p><p></p><p>Tiklos was introduced at the 1967 University of the Pacific Folk Dance Camp by Bernardo T. Pedere, who was the lead male dancer and dance con- sultant of the Leyte Filipiniana Folk Dance Group which in 1966 toured the United States.</p><p></p><br />
