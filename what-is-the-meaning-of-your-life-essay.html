For us to completely describe the right triangles, one must find the measure of each of its sides and angles. The measures may not be that very exact, but we use defined formulas to find its estimated values. We can relate the concept of 'finding the missing parts of right triangles to one of the best quotations of Mr. Carl Jung, "Life calls, not for perfection, but completeness." What do you think are the things or qualities that may make a person's life complete? Write your answer (5-10 sentences) at the back of this paper.​</a>

Why does Schopenhauer think that suffering outweighs pleasure in life? Why does Schopenhauer reject God as a source of meaning in life? Why does he think that love is not capable of providing meaning either? If life is as meaningless as he intimates, does he think that suicide is an appropriate choice? Why or why not? What advice does Schopenhauer offer in terms of trying to inhabit a world with such woes? What arguments could one use to challenge him? Where do you stand on Schopenhauer's views, and why? Be sure to use concrete example to illustrate your points. Required Texts E.D. Klemke and Steven M. Cahn (eds.). The Meaning of Life, 4th Edition (Oxford 2017).

                                            Question: Can I get a long well explained University level essay that Analyze why Schopenhauer interprets life as amounting to suffering, and what he believes makes life more insufferable. Why does Schopenhauer think that suffering outweighs pleasure in life? Why does Schopenhauer reject God as a source of meaning in life? Why does he think that love is not capable of providing meaning either? If life is as meaningless as he intimates, does he think that suicide is an appropriate choice? Why or why not? What advice does Schopenhauer offer in terms of trying to inhabit a world with such woes? What arguments could one use to challenge him? Where do you stand on Schopenhauer's views, and why? Be sure to use concrete example to illustrate your points.

</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Even if there were many consequences and trials you've faced, you would still forced yourself to face them to move on in life. You won't just stop there, you will fight. And in every trial you would faced, there is always something that you would learn. And through that learning, you will learn to grow more and accept challenges with confidence and chin up high. There's no need to  be afraid of life. Life must be the one to be afraid of you, because your the one who makes choices that will later turn to sweet or bitter effects.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In facing life too, we must at all cost, learn to have fun along the way. Being serious about life is good too but too much of it, can lead you to unhappiness. Be positive and socialize with others, meet new people and learn new experiences. Life is never always sweet at us. There are always times that we wanted to give up but why do you think we never really completely have given up?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>One thing's for sure. It's love. There's a saying that goes, Love doesn't make the world go around but makes the ride worthwhile. There's always someone out there who is always helping you and concern about you. Don't make her/him go away, yet cherish and treasure him/her. That feeling will always be within you, no matter where you are. Love is really a great thing to experience while we are still alive and well yet we don't need to rush in order to find love. Let love find us instead. True happiness will eventually follow next after that. So don't give up on life, counter it and show life that there are plenty of reasons for you to smile</strong></p><p></p><br />

For us to completely describe the right triangles, one must find the measure of each of its sides and angles. The measures may not be that very exact, but we use defined formulas to find its estimated values. We can relate the concept of 'finding the missing parts of right triangles to one of the best quotations of Mr. Carl Jung, "Life calls, not for perfection, but completeness."

                        <p>The book of Matthew is one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is believed to have been written by Matthew, a disciple of Jesus, and is primarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The book contains the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of the Kingdom" due to its emphasis on the coming of the Kingdom of God.</p><p></p><p>The book of Mark is also one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Mark, a disciple of Peter, and is primarily focused on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. The book contains Jesus' baptism, temptation, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Action" due to its emphasis on Jesus' deeds rather than his words.</p><p></p><p>The book of John is another one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by John, a disciple of Jesus, and is primarily focused on the divinity of Jesus Christ. The book contains Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Belief" due to its emphasis on the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God.</p><p></p><p>The book of Luke is the third Gospel book in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Luke, a physician and companion of Paul, and is primarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The book contains the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Mercy" due to its emphasis on Jesus' compassion and concern for the poor and marginalized.</p><p></p><p>One of the most well-known Bible verses about the Gospel is John 3:16, which states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse highlights the central message of the Gospel, which is that through faith in Jesus Christ, we can be saved and have eternal life.</p><p></p><p>The Gospel is of utmost importance in the life of Christians because it contains the message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. It provides guidance, comfort, and hope to believers, and helps them to live a life in accordance with God's will.</p><p></p><p>At this moment in my life, the most significant Bible verse that I would use to communicate is Philippians 4:6-7, which states, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." This verse reminds us to trust in God and to bring our worries and concerns to Him in prayer.</p><p></p><p>To help my family read the Bible well, I can encourage them to set aside a specific time each day for Bible reading and prayer, and to choose a Bible study plan or devotional to follow. I can also discuss and reflect on the passages with them to deepen our understanding and share our insights.</p><p></p><p>In this pandemic time, I can apply the teachings of the Gospel by showing compassion and kindness to those who are affected by the virus, and by trusting in God's plan and His protection.</p><p></p><p>Dear God, we pray for your protection and good health during this pandemic time. May you guard our hearts and minds and keep us safe</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th century German philosopher, interprets life as amounting to suffering in his work "The World as Will and Representation." He argues that the fundamental aspect of existence is not the rational, conscious self, but rather the underlying will to live, which he refers to as the "will to exist." This will is the source of all suffering, as it drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer believes that the will to exist makes life more insufferable by constantly creating new desires and needs that can never truly be satisfied, resulting in a state of constant dissatisfaction. He states, "Desire is never satisfied by the satisfaction of a desire; indeed, the satisfaction of one desire is but the beginning of another" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.88). He also believes that suffering outweighs pleasure in life because suffering is more intense and longer-lasting than pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer rejects God as a source of meaning in life because he argues that the concept of God only serves to perpetuate the cycle of suffering caused by the will to exist. He states, "If God were to grant us all our desires and needs, we would only desire for more and greater things" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.89). He also argues that love is not capable of providing meaning because it is ultimately driven by the will to exist and therefore leads to suffering.</p><p></p><p>Despite his assertion that life is meaningless, Schopenhauer does not advocate for suicide as an appropriate choice. Instead, he advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. He suggests that individuals should focus on cultivating a sense of detachment and detachment from the will to exist, which he believes can lead to a state of contentment and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>However, one could argue that Schopenhauer's views are overly pessimistic and fail to take into account the positive aspects of life such as love, joy, and compassion. Additionally, his emphasis on detachment and denial of desires can be seen as a rejection of human nature and a failure to fully engage with the world.</p><p></p><p>Personally, while I acknowledge the validity of Schopenhauer's argument that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience, I believe that it is important to also recognize and appreciate the positive aspects of life. Therefore, I do not fully agree with his views.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Schopenhauer's interpretation of life as amounting to suffering is rooted in his belief that the fundamental aspect of existence is the will to live, which drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment. He rejects God and love as sources of meaning in life and instead advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. However, his views have been criticized for being overly pessimistic and for rejecting human nature.</p><br />
