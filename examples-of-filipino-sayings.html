Original Pilipino Music? Do you agree with what the title of this popular song "Kay Ganda ng Ating
Musika", is saying? Why is it that Filipino songs are considered beautiful? What makes them beautiful?

                        <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Filipinos are a very hospitable and friendly people. They always smile no matter how they feel. If meeting someone for the first time, it would be good to smile at the person before you even start a conversation.</p><p></p><p>Filipino, which is largely-based on Tagalog, is the national language. English is also widely spoken by most Filipinos. The medium of instruction in most school is English. Media is mostly in Tagalog and English so it is not surprising that most Filipinos can speak English.  It is easy for Filipinos to strike a conversation with any one even if they tend to be shy.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos have close family ties and always love to talk about their extended family, especially about their children. So a good conversation piece is asking about their family – which region or province they come from, whether they have children, their ages and what grade in school they are in. It is also acceptable to ask about what work they do or where they work. Since Filipinos do not mind talking about personal aspects of their life, do not be surprised to be asked very personal questions such as your marital status and your age.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(If someone throws a rock at you, throw him bread.)</p><p></p><p>If there is a Filipino proverb that can very accurately capture the Filipino character, it is this one. It’s a metaphor that instructs you to be compassionate and forgiving if someone has wronged you. It also reflects the notoriously non-confrontational nature of Filipinos, who prefer peace and quiet.</p><p></p><p>2| Nasa Diyos and awa, nasa tao ang gawa.</p><p></p><p>(To be merciful is God’s, while to act is man’s.)</p><p></p><p>Basically, this proverb tells us not only to pray for blessings but to work for them. God will be gracious to people who act and help themselves.</p><p></p><p>3| Mahirap gisingin ang nagtutulug-tulugan.</p><p></p><p>(It’s difficult to wake up someone who is pretending to be asleep.)</p><p></p><p>This Filipino proverb simply means that you cannot force someone to believe facts when they don’t want to. Sometimes, there is something about the truth that some people just don’t like to bear.</p><p></p><p>4| May pakpak ang balita, may tainga ang lupa.</p><p></p><p>(News have wings, while the ground has ears.)</p><p></p><p>This old Filipino proverb is a fair warning to all: Gossip travels fast. Interestingly, it also gives us insight that our Filipino ancestors may have peddled gossip long before the birth of mass media.</p><p></p><p></p><p>5| Ang taong walang kibo, nasa loob ang kulo.</p><p></p><p>(A quiet person hides his anger.)</p><p></p><p>The literal translation of this adage is "The rage of a quiet person is kept inside him." This proverb is a warning to people not to take someone’s silence as a sign of submission or tolerance, especially if he is being picked on. He might be hiding his true feelings or has bottled up emotions and could be harboring ill thoughts or intentions about you without you knowing.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Please help, say it in English because I don’t understand Filipino well.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Every number divisible by 9 is divisible by 3. For example, 7425 is divisible by 9, hence it is divisible by 3. However, a number divisible by 3 is not necessarily divisible by 9.</p><p>2.The Rule for 4 : If the last two digits of a whole number are divisible by 4 , then the entire number is divisible by 4 . ... If the last three digits of a whole number are divisible by 8 , then the entire number is divisible by 8.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. True. Because  9 is divisible by 3 and all numbers which have the sum of the digits divisible by 9 is always divisible by 9 and 3 but not all numbers divisible by 3 is divisible by 9.</p><p></p><p>81 - the sum of the digits is 9 so it is also divisible by 3</p><p>12- divisible by 3 but not divisible by 9</p><p></p><p>2.False. Not all numbers divisible by 4 is also divisble by 8 but all numbers divisible by 8 is divisible by 2 and 4.</p><p></p><p>12- divisble by 4 but not by 8</p><p>40 - divisible by 2,4, and 8.</p><br />
