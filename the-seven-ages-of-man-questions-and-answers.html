The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</a>

Do this in your notebook."I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacherin one of the smallest towns in the Philippines-Baler.My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectarerice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy andduring my early youth, my father saved as much as hecould from his meager salary and from what he couldget from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesoswith which to give me an education. During thoseSpanish days, a Filipino family could live in a smalltown on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus,did my family live for years. When I was at the age offive, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own fatherand mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primaryinstruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila andbegan my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I livedin the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for onepriest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father movedme to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded.The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him whocould only use his own feet as a means of transportation. Myclasses started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up veryearly to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and thefollowing year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as anintern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highesthonors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on myeducation. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop mystudies unless I could work my way through university education. I cameto Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, hadbecome very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be alawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for meas one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and boardand free tuition.

When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very . early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors.

                                            Answer the following questions. Woman A Simple Act of Kindness To see full packed buses is not surprising. In the past, when a lady or an old was standing, while the rest of the passengers were sented, almost expectedly, a man would after his seat as a gentleman's act. Over the years, this practice has become rare. Overloaded jeepneys are also not usual. Although there are laws that prohibit passengers to hang on at the back of the vehicle because it is dangerous, one can still see these almost anywhere. Now, there was this boy, maybe between 12-13 years old, who was seated in a fully loaded jeepney. He had two heavy looking bags probably filled with books and notebooks. As the jeepney made its stop, about two passengers got off but several people jostled one another just to be able to get seats. A man in his '70s tried to get on board. Since he was quite slow due to his age, he was not able to get a seat for himself. So, he decided to hang on at the back of the jeepney. This is dangerous because if the jeepney makes a sudden stop, one might lose this grip or his balance and the chance of falling from the jeepney is great. Suddenly and to the surprise of everyone inside the jeepney, the boy spoke out loud, "Tay (short for Itay), you may take my seat." The old man smiled and thanked the boy. Another passenger offered his lap for the boy to sit on, but he refused. The boy was able to sit when a passenger got off. seven-berit stones that-have-restored-ny-suth-the-fino 1.

And all the men and women merely players, They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms: And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel. Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut. Full of wise saws and modern instances: And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side: His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion. Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. 4.

Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</a>

My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education.

Yan po Sana po matulungan nyo po ako please Learning Task 4: READ ME Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</h2><br />

                            12. Answer the following questions. Woman A Simple Act of Kindness To see full packed buses is not surprising. In the past, when a lady or an old was standing, while the rest of the passengers were sented, almost expectedly, a man would after his seat as a gentleman's act. Over the years, this practice has become rare. Overloaded jeepneys are also not usual. Although there are laws that prohibit passengers to hang on at the back of the vehicle because it is dangerous, one can still see these almost anywhere. Now, there was this boy, maybe between 12-13 years old, who was seated in a fully loaded jeepney. He had two heavy looking bags probably filled with books and notebooks. As the jeepney made its stop, about two passengers got off but several people jostled one another just to be able to get seats. A man in his '70s tried to get on board. Since he was quite slow due to his age, he was not able to get a seat for himself. So, he decided to hang on at the back of the jeepney. This is dangerous because if the jeepney makes a sudden stop, one might lose this grip or his balance and the chance of falling from the jeepney is great. Suddenly and to the surprise of everyone inside the jeepney, the boy spoke out loud, "Tay (short for Itay), you may take my seat." The old man smiled and thanked the boy. Another passenger offered his lap for the boy to sit on, but he refused. The boy was able to sit when a passenger got off. seven-berit stones that-have-restored-ny-suth-the-fino 1. What is your opinion about the gesture of the boy? 2. Did he make the right decision of letting the old man sit? 3. If you were the boy in the story, would you do the same? Why?paki answer haba nang tinype ko tas ang answer nonsence help lng pls​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. My opinion about the boy, is he's very respectful and helpful. Probably because he's parents taught him well or he has a proper upbringing.</p><p>2. I believe he made the right decision to let the old man sit.</p><p>3. I would do the same because I was raised to show and act with respect to the elderly especially to those who are in need.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

“I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher 
in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. 
My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare 
rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and 
during my early youth, my father saved as much as he 
could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos

Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small

did my family live for years. When I was at the age of 
five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father

in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who 
could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My 
classes started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very 
early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the 
following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an 
intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest

Seven Ages of Man By William Shakespeare All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players, They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms: And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel. Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut. Full of wise saws and modern instances: And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side: His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion. Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. 4.

Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</h2><br />

Do this in your notebook. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law." own Source: http://www quezon ph/familyinfo/autoblography of manuell quezon-from-a-privilege-speech/ 1.

PLEASE ANSWERED THISS PLSSSSSSSSSS</h2><br />
                        <strong>Seven Ages of Man</strong><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The Seven Ages of Man</strong> was poem that spoke many volumes, it depicted the situations that every man face in his life. From cruel reality and the needs and wants from life’s unforeseen future. We roam the world as if we are in a state of oblivion. We do what we want to do, we finish what we want to finish. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>A soldier facing the war, with confidence. This part in the <strong>Seven Ages of Man</strong> reminded me of confident people that inspired me to do something brave for once in a while. The meaning of this, is pride, confidence, strength of a man. Also the courage to face something inevitably scary like the cannon’s mouth. A soldier that faces danger armed with courage and still reaches his goal. Roles in life like: A son , A lover , A soldier , A man in his old age . These roles were that of what Shakespeare thought of using to represent a man’s journey through life. Typically shown a son/ daughter, our first role in the society when we were born. A lover, when we grow into an adult we find someone who we want to spend our life with therefore cherish them. A soldier, someone who fights for his country, who protects other people despite the massive damage it might inflict upon themselves. A man in his old age, the last part where we finally settle with our life. It is expected that we get to enjoy the remaining days on earth by living most of what is left.  It was worth reading, for it helps people understand in another point of view.The poem’s message was heavy yet not enough to change the whole ideal perspective of someone. Well, it is enough to influence your opinion on a particular thing but not all. <p>The poem <strong>The Seven Ages of Man</strong> was Shakespeare’s point of view in beautiful writing and composition, with deep meaning words that supports his views in life. The mere fact that this was made back in the year 1500 and still has an impact as of today in the 20th century, clearly states that a man’s journey is still the same or going in the same direction.</p><p></p><p>For more topics like this click the links below:  </p><p>Poem of the seven age of man: https://brainly.ph/question/2245682  </p><p>Seven stages in The seven Ages of Man: https://brainly.ph/question/604613  </p><p>Imagery of the seven ages of man: https://brainly.ph/question/2203236  </p><p></p><br />
