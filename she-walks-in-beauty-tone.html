                                            Read the given story. Then answer the questions that follow In this dream I was the girl with tattered short pants and shirt. I enjoyed each beautiful day atid it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket inade of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. “Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pandesal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESALI PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pandesal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When, suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream. 1. Describe the setting of the story. 2. Describe the girl's character. 3. What would you do if you were on the girl's shoe and your money was taken away? Explain your answer. 4. In your own ways, how can you help your parents / guardians? 5. Give a title of the story.​</a>

Then, familiarize the rubrics and WRITE YOUR SHORT ANALYSIS My Dream in DreamIn this dream I was the girl with tattered short pants and shirt. I enjoyed each beautiful day and it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket made of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. "Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pan desal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESAL! PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pan desal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream.charactersplot - foreshadowing and flashbackPOVmoodsymboltonethemefig. lang​​</a>

I enjoyed each beautiful day atid it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket inade of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. “Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pandesal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESALI PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pandesal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When, suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream. 1.
