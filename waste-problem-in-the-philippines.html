While plans to expand some sites are being proposed and a controversial mega-incinerator project remains a possibility, focus in the city is turning to how to reduce the amount of waste it produces. The local government has created a task force to address the issue of food waste and has set a 10% reduction target by 2016. Globally, only around 3% of food waste is recycle.B. Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I have never been away from my homeland, the Philippines. First of all, the Philippines has a total land area of about 300 000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514 000 square kilometers. The latest census shows that Filipinos are now 100 000 000 in number. Thais, on the other hand, are now 67 000 000PROBLEM: SOLUTION:pasagot po. asapNonsense answer : report​</a>
