                                            Why it is important to know and understand by the waiter or server the establishment guidelines in operating ordering system?​essay: Every establishment has a specific protocol for taking orders from the table and giving them to the kitchen and assembly areas. A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. Asking for your order to be a "rush" order is not a good idea, unless there is a really good reason for it. Servers who are always "rush" orders will find themselves placed at the back of the queue, more often than not.Orders can be written on checks, the duplicate of which is given to the kitchen. If handwriting orders, your handwriting must be legible and easy to understand. Always use the appropriate abbreviations; do not make up your own -- the kitchen will not understand them. Keep your original check or ticket as this is your record of the food that you have ordered from the kitchen, and from which the final bill will be prepared. Never throw these away. If a mistake has been made, run a line through the mistake, and, if necessary, have the manager initial it.More and more restaurants are using a Point of Service computer where you will enter the order from your table and it is automatically delivered via the computer to the kitchen.Your biggest job will be the timing of your orders. Make a point of learning how long it takes to prepare any given dish, then put in the order for the one that takes the longest to prepare first. That way, all dinners for a given table should come out at the same time. Nothing is more uncomfortable for your guests than to serve three guests at a table, only to find out that the fourth guest's meal has not yet been started.The next point that requires your attention is to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Not only is this necessary for food safety, it also helps to preserve the beauty of the prepared food.There is nothing more unappetizing than to have a cold pat of butter melting on the bread and butter plate because it was served hot. It is your job to ensure that the food arrives at the table in the condition in which it was served from the kitchen.yan po sagot ko </a>

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</a>

You may modify the sample outline format presented before. This I Believe Carlos P. Romulo I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</a>

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                                            thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

My leaves are green and can provide shades; not mentioning the sweet fruits that I can give." The bamboo was listening but it remained silent. Day after day, the mango tree became proud of itself. 3 It usually talked about how strongly it became and how useful it was to the people. One day, a strong typhoon came. The mango tree stood proudly against the wind. It never bent nor yielded. But its roots were uprooted and it tumbled down. The bamboo tree might not be as robust as the mango tree; however, it found its way against the wind. Every time the strong winds blew, it bent. It swayed. Its branches swayed. At the end, the bamboo tree stood still. (Adapted from the essay, Pliant Like a Bamboo by I.V. Mallari) Process Questions 1. How will you describe the mango tree? 2.

Everybody is in a hurry to go somewhere. Industry for instance, is constantly demanding new invetions that will speed up production so that tha constant cry of bosses to the workmen is speed it up the maker of authomobiles, for example, boasts the newest type of a car which is faster than the old model. In the same way the shoppers push and shove each other all about the counters much likely when all are in a hurry to get something. And, in the same way, people who are going to school, shop, or office rush breathlessly to do important tasks.3. You have to beat first the eggs then pour them into the pan, turn the heat down and use your fork to mix slowly. And then just put a knife underneath and flip the omelet over. 4. Many people have never heard of the term confrere, for instance. One basic definition is a fellow member of a profession, fraternity, etc. As such, you could compare confrere with colleague, which is similar yet more familiar concept. 5. Speed is a concept that marks our day. Sluggishness is out. Speed is demanded by industry which is constantly on the look out for new inventions. Sluggishness is penalized, especially in industries where compensation depends upon output. Speed is the attractive come on for short term courses in cooking, computerizing, sewing, diving, learning, learning a new language, and others. The slower longterm courses are not so appealing. Instant coffee is usually preferred to coffee that must be boiled yet. Yes, speed is the word fir the day. ​</a>

                                            DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

Write your answers in the space provided. PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE by I.V. Mallari There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like a bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.” The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be PLIANT like the Bamboo.

An honest friend tellsyou the truth even if it’s not always what you want to hear. In the long run, that honest friend mayhave saved you from embarrassment or possibly rejection. They give you constructivecriticisms overall. A loyal friend is the type of friend that will be there for you through thick andthin. They don’t care how good or bad you may look one day; they are sensitive to your feelings,they respect you and the other people in your life, and most of all they will never let you downwhen times are hard. They may be what you call a best friend. The third group, the person thatfits you into their schedule, is the type of person that is always on the go. They barely have timefor themselves let alone another person. More than likely they will not be there for you whenyou need them most, because they are so wrapped up in their busy, hectic life.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To never give up means to stand up and try one more time even when you completely feel like you are unable to do and are tempted to quit. Regardless of whether you slow down or not, you should keep on trying. One of the main drivers of success is persistence, perseverance and a resolution to keep on trying. Even when your body aches and the scars seem to be wearing you down; do not accept in your mind to quit. Do not say no to your dreams. It is important to preserve as opposed to being lazy and letting defeatism take a toll on you. We tend to learn these negative vices from the society, our surroundings and our peers. Do not allow your environment to plunge you into despair; instead always have hope that in turn fuels perseverance.</p><br />

                            5. Why it is important to know and understand by the waiter or server the establishment guidelines in operating ordering system?​essay: Every establishment has a specific protocol for taking orders from the table and giving them to the kitchen and assembly areas. A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. Asking for your order to be a "rush" order is not a good idea, unless there is a really good reason for it. Servers who are always "rush" orders will find themselves placed at the back of the queue, more often than not.Orders can be written on checks, the duplicate of which is given to the kitchen. If handwriting orders, your handwriting must be legible and easy to understand. Always use the appropriate abbreviations; do not make up your own -- the kitchen will not understand them. Keep your original check or ticket as this is your record of the food that you have ordered from the kitchen, and from which the final bill will be prepared. Never throw these away. If a mistake has been made, run a line through the mistake, and, if necessary, have the manager initial it.More and more restaurants are using a Point of Service computer where you will enter the order from your table and it is automatically delivered via the computer to the kitchen.Your biggest job will be the timing of your orders. Make a point of learning how long it takes to prepare any given dish, then put in the order for the one that takes the longest to prepare first. That way, all dinners for a given table should come out at the same time. Nothing is more uncomfortable for your guests than to serve three guests at a table, only to find out that the fourth guest's meal has not yet been started.The next point that requires your attention is to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Not only is this necessary for food safety, it also helps to preserve the beauty of the prepared food.There is nothing more unappetizing than to have a cold pat of butter melting on the bread and butter plate because it was served hot. It is your job to ensure that the food arrives at the table in the condition in which it was served from the kitchen.yan po sagot ko </h2><br />

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</h2><br />

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</h2><br />

                            13. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                            14. thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

Once there were two different trees growing up together. The mango tree grew One morning, the mango tree stood still and proudly said, “I grow big and strong. My trunk is sturdy. My branches cannot easily be broken. My leaves are green and can provide shades; not mentioning the sweet fruits that I can give." The bamboo was listening but it remained silent. Day after day, the mango tree became proud of itself. 3 It usually talked about how strongly it became and how useful it was to the people. One day, a strong typhoon came. The mango tree stood proudly against the wind. It never bent nor yielded. But its roots were uprooted and it tumbled down. The bamboo tree might not be as robust as the mango tree; however, it found its way against the wind. Every time the strong winds blew, it bent. It swayed. Its branches swayed. At the end, the bamboo tree stood still. (Adapted from the essay, Pliant Like a Bamboo by I.V. Mallari) Process Questions 1. How will you describe the mango tree? 2. What kind of characteristics does the bamboo exemplify?3. To whom will you be able to compare the mango tree? Why? How about the bamboo tree? Why? 4.

Everybody is in a hurry to go somewhere. Industry for instance, is constantly demanding new invetions that will speed up production so that tha constant cry of bosses to the workmen is speed it up the maker of authomobiles, for example, boasts the newest type of a car which is faster than the old model. In the same way the shoppers push and shove each other all about the counters much likely when all are in a hurry to get something. And, in the same way, people who are going to school, shop, or office rush breathlessly to do important tasks.3. You have to beat first the eggs then pour them into the pan, turn the heat down and use your fork to mix slowly. And then just put a knife underneath and flip the omelet over. 4. Many people have never heard of the term confrere, for instance. One basic definition is a fellow member of a profession, fraternity, etc. As such, you could compare confrere with colleague, which is similar yet more familiar concept. 5. Speed is a concept that marks our day. Sluggishness is out. Speed is demanded by industry which is constantly on the look out for new inventions. Sluggishness is penalized, especially in industries where compensation depends upon output. Speed is the attractive come on for short term courses in cooking, computerizing, sewing, diving, learning, learning a new language, and others. The slower longterm courses are not so appealing.

                            24. DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The position paper is about whether anti-smoking ad campaigns really help or not. </p><p>2. The writer's evidences/reasons are that according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers has dropped significantly in recent years, their ads can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff, and they can help parents realize how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. </p><p>3. If I were the writer, my stand would be that anti-smoking ad campaigns are effective because they are able to motivate people to quit smoking and help parents realize the dangers of passive smoking for their kids. The evidence provided by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention also suggests that the number of smokers has declined significantly in the past decade, suggesting that the campaigns are having a positive impact.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Write your answers in the space provided. PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE by I.V. Mallari There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like a bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.” The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be PLIANT like the Bamboo.

                            29. Friends can be classified according to their honesty, loyalty, the type that fits you into theirschedule, or the type that finds time for you when they need something. An honest friend tellsyou the truth even if it’s not always what you want to hear. In the long run, that honest friend mayhave saved you from embarrassment or possibly rejection. They give you constructivecriticisms overall. A loyal friend is the type of friend that will be there for you through thick andthin. They don’t care how good or bad you may look one day; they are sensitive to your feelings,they respect you and the other people in your life, and most of all they will never let you downwhen times are hard. They may be what you call a best friend. The third group, the person thatfits you into their schedule, is the type of person that is always on the go. They barely have timefor themselves let alone another person. More than likely they will not be there for you whenyou need them most, because they are so wrapped up in their busy, hectic life. Then you havethe self-absorbent type of friend that finds time for you only when they need something. Thistype of person isn’t what you would call a friend. This person may always be extremely nice toyou because they know that if they are nice to you then they will more than likely get what theywant. They will call you every once in a while when it is almost time for them to use that personagain. It may be for a ride to work, home or they just want somebody to hang out with becausethey have no other friends. If the person that is being used is smart they will eventually realizethat they are getting used and will stop being there for that person. 1. What are the three types of friends?2.
