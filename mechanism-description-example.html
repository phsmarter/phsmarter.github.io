                        <p>I have accepted the fact that people who suffer from anxiety and depression will never be cured. Therapy is always there but I've never really seen it as an option probably because I live in the Philippines. However, I meet more and more people who have chosen to get help and so far, there are mixed opinions. The Philippines already has the Mental Health Act approved by the two houses of the senate which hopefully will be passed into law this year (2018).

It uses the complex grammatical sentence structure and vocabulary that are only known by experts in that field</p><p>2.)Formal Style</p><p>This type uses formal words and expressions and is mostly seen in writing rather than speaking. It also disallows the use of ellipsis, contractions, and qualifying modal adverbials.</p><p>3.)Consultative Style</p><p>The third level of language. It is basically unplanned speech since the speaker uses the participation and feedback of the listener. The speaker will supply background information, while again, the listener participates continuously</p><p>4.)Casual Style</p><p>Also known as informal style, it is usually used between, friends, or even insiders who have things to share. In this type, there is a free and easy participation of both speaker and listener.</p><p>5.)Intimate Style</p><p>The last type is used in talks between two very close individuals.

                        Physical weathering, also known as mechanical weather, is the process of rocks and minerals on Earth's surface breaking down or dissolving as a result of water, ice, salt, plants, animals or changes in temperature. Physical weathering does not change the chemical composition of the rock, just cracks and crumbles it into smaller pieces. After a rock has weathered, erosion occurs, transporting bits and pieces away. Finally a deposition process deposits the rock particles in a new place.<p></p><br />
