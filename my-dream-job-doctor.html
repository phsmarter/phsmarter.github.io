When Dad was a child, he wanted to be many things- a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, a business, and a security guard. His father, Lolo Dom, told him to just enjoy learning. Dad's mother, Lola Lydia, helped him make a daily schedule when he was a student. This helped him keep track of what he needs to do and accomplish for the day My grandmother also made sure that my dad finds time to play and do the activities he loves, like dancing, singing, and painting. My grandfather would often tell stories about my dad's performance in the school play and his stint as a school athlete. Although he is not a star performer or athlete, he always tries and does his best. He looks up to his favorite teacher who would challenge him to never give up on his dreams and to work hard to achieve them Do you want to know a secret? My dad does not stop learning. Just recently, he asked my older brother to teach him how to play the guitarl And the best job he ever had? "Being your father, of course," he said.1. What did dad want to be when he was a child?2.
