                                            Case Title: The Mexican Peso, the Japanese Yen, and Pokémon Go
Case Abstract
This case explores the implications of changing currency values on Japanese game maker Nintendo. Nintendo’s revenues in Mexico have been affected by the falling value of peso against the yen. In early 2015, one Mexican peso was equal to 8 Japanese yen, but by September of 2016, one peso was worth just 5.1 yen. Trades of Mexican pesos to Japanese yen typically require a conversion via the U.S. dollar. In 2016, the dollar was lower against the yen, while at the same time, the Mexican peso was lower relative to the dollar making conversions of revenues earned in pesos worth much less when translated back to yen.
Currency values often reflect investors’ risk assessments of a country. Japan’s position as a safe haven country, for example, helps to support the value of its currency. In contrast, the Mexican peso, the most liquid emerging market currency, took a hit following the election of Donald Trump in 2016. Trump had been outspoken in his perception that the trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, known as NAFTA, did not benefit the United States as much as it did Mexico and Canada, and that therefore, the United States should pull out of the agreement.
While NAFTA was ultimately renegotiated and renamed, the impact of the drop in the value of the peso relative to the yen created issues not only for Nintendo, but for other companies as well. Toyota and Mazda saw prices for components used in their assembly operation in Mexico rise when prices on Japanese-produced parts were translated into pesos. Higher prices resulted in lower profits for both companies. At the same time, the decline in the peso meant that some companies were better off. Mexican pork processors, for example, benefitted from the weak peso via exports to Japan. Convenience stores in Japan also profited from the lower peso, buying Mexican processed pork and capitalizing on currency movements and lower labor costs. 
Discussion Questions
Why are most trades between the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso made through U.S. dollars? (25 Points)
Explain why the peso fell in value against the Japanese yen during 2016. How predictable was this fall? (25 Points)
What were the benefits of the fall in the value of the peso against the yen for Mexican companies? What were the costs? (25 Points)
Should Japanese companies, such as Nintendo and Toyota, with business in Mexico have hedged against adverse changes in the peso/yen exchange rate? How might they have done that? (25 Points)</a>

                            3. Case Title: The Mexican Peso, the Japanese Yen, and Pokémon Go
Case Abstract
This case explores the implications of changing currency values on Japanese game maker Nintendo. Nintendo’s revenues in Mexico have been affected by the falling value of peso against the yen. In early 2015, one Mexican peso was equal to 8 Japanese yen, but by September of 2016, one peso was worth just 5.1 yen. Trades of Mexican pesos to Japanese yen typically require a conversion via the U.S. dollar. In 2016, the dollar was lower against the yen, while at the same time, the Mexican peso was lower relative to the dollar making conversions of revenues earned in pesos worth much less when translated back to yen.
Currency values often reflect investors’ risk assessments of a country. Japan’s position as a safe haven country, for example, helps to support the value of its currency. In contrast, the Mexican peso, the most liquid emerging market currency, took a hit following the election of Donald Trump in 2016. Trump had been outspoken in his perception that the trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, known as NAFTA, did not benefit the United States as much as it did Mexico and Canada, and that therefore, the United States should pull out of the agreement.
While NAFTA was ultimately renegotiated and renamed, the impact of the drop in the value of the peso relative to the yen created issues not only for Nintendo, but for other companies as well. Toyota and Mazda saw prices for components used in their assembly operation in Mexico rise when prices on Japanese-produced parts were translated into pesos. Higher prices resulted in lower profits for both companies. At the same time, the decline in the peso meant that some companies were better off. Mexican pork processors, for example, benefitted from the weak peso via exports to Japan. Convenience stores in Japan also profited from the lower peso, buying Mexican processed pork and capitalizing on currency movements and lower labor costs.

Explain why the peso fell in value against the Japanese yen during 2016. How predictable was this fall? (25 Points)
What were the benefits of the fall in the value of the peso against the yen for Mexican companies? What were the costs? (25 Points)
Should Japanese companies, such as Nintendo and Toyota, with business in Mexico have hedged against adverse changes in the peso/yen exchange rate? How might they have done that? (25 Points)</h2><br />
                        AnswerWhy are most trades between the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso made through U.S. dollars?  It is because the value of US dollar is lower against the yen, and Mexican Peso is lower than US dollar. The low currency value of the Mexican peso helps Japanese companies earn a profit because it is much easier to sell at a lower price. Explain why the peso fell in value against the Japanese yen during 2016. How predictable was this fall? In 2016, President Donald Trump thought that the United States did not benefit from NAFTA(The North American Free Trade Agreement). The fall of peso was expected because of Trump's  "Pro-America" political agenda.What were the benefits of the fall in the value of the peso against the yen for Mexican companies? What were the costs? Mexican pork processors, for example, benefitted from the weak peso via exports to Japan. Convenience stores in Japan also profited from the lower peso, buying Mexican processed pork and capitalizing on currency movements and lower labor costs. <strong>*This is taken from the Case Abstract</strong>Should Japanese companies, such as Nintendo and Toyota, with business in Mexico have hedged against adverse changes in the peso/yen exchange rate? How might they have done that? Japan’s position as a safe haven country, for example, helps to support the value of its currency. <strong>*This is taken from the Case Abstract</strong>*<strong>Hedged </strong>means protect oneself against loss on (a bet or investment) by making balancing or compensating transactions.<strong>Answer: </strong>Japan should maintain a healthy Yen value in the NAFTA market to sustain prices and lower labor costs.<p></p><p><strong>Importance of Visual Art Elements - </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2809402 </p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />
