                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Investment risk can be defined as the probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment. It is a measure of the level of uncertainty of achieving the returns as per the expectations of the investor. It is the extent of unexpected results to be realized. Risk is an important component in assessment of the prospects of an investment. Most investors while making an investment consider less risk as favorable. The lesser the investment risk, more lucrative is the investment. However, the thumb rule is the higher the risk, the better the return.</p><p></p><p>Portfolio risk is a chance that the combination of assets or units, within the investments that you own, fail to meet financial objectives. Each investment within a portfolio carries its own risk, with higher potential return typically meaning higher risk. In theory, portfolio risk can be eliminated by successful diversification: holding combinations of investments that do not depend on the same circumstances to return a profit. In reality, though, it is more probable that risks will be minimised and not eliminated entirely. Portfolio risk is just one of the risks that traders should be wary of.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ASSAY: Throughout the years electricity has become a source of energy that cannot seem to be replaced; however there are many different alternatives to this source of energy. One specific alternative is geothermal energy, which might be just as effective as electricity, but much less harmful to the environment. Electricity, although very helpful, produces fuels that might be harming not only our world, but our human society. To power electricity we must use fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. An electrical current is produced because of the attraction between the protons and the electrons. As the electron moves around the atom’s nucleus it forms an electrical current. Electricity is powered by the fossil fuels that are non-renewable,…show more content…</p><p></p><p>In the flash steam approach, very hot water is used to power the turbines, it is collected in a tank in which the pressure is lowered enough to cause the liquid to form to steam. The third approach, binary steam, uses very high temperatures to heat another fluid, and then this fluid is transformed into steam, and begins to power the turbines. And the cycle converts the steam back to a fluid starting once again. In comparison to the usage of electricity, geothermal energy is renewable, does not pollute the air as much as electricity, no additional sources of fuel are needed to keep the power running, and once a power station is created it is very effective and not as expensive. The earth has been producing heat for billions of years and it seems as if it will keep producing many more to come. Some disadvantages are that a power plant can only be placed in a certain place, and in some cases the site where the station was built might run out of heat to convert to steam. Dangerous gases might escape from the earth’s center when making these power stations. In the other hand, electricity is producing a great amount of greenhouse gases that are affecting our environment. Also the prices for electricity are much more expensive in comparison to geothermal energy. The average price for electricity in the United States was 20.0 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2013 according to The Bureau of Labor Statistics, and according to University of Michigan</p>ML ID : 600118590 PA HEART AT BRAINLIEST  <p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction <br />The fund is managed by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and it was established in 2010. It has a P50 million initial capital and it will be used to finance criminal cases filed against public officials, private individuals, or organizations who are involved in corruption. The NBI is the only agency that can file such cases since they have the mandate from the law to investigate crimes committed by public officials.</p><p></p><p>The Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) is a Philippine government-owned investment fund that was established in 2019 to provide financial assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The MIF has been touted as a way to help SMEs access capital and grow their businesses, but there are some who argue that the fund is not the best way to help SMEs. In this essay, I will make an argument in favor of the MIF, arguing that it is an effective way to help SMEs access capital and grow their businesses.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph 1</p><p></p><p>The MIF provides SMEs with access to capital that they would not otherwise have. The fund provides loans and grants to SMEs, which can be used to purchase equipment, hire new employees, and expand their operations. This access to capital can be invaluable for SMEs, as it allows them to invest in their businesses and grow. Furthermore, the MIF also provides technical assistance to SMEs, which can help them develop business plans and access other forms of financing.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph 2</p><p></p><p>The MIF is also beneficial for the Philippine economy as a whole. By providing capital to SMEs, the MIF helps to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. This can have a positive effect on the entire economy, as more jobs mean more people with money to spend, which can lead to increased consumer spending and economic growth. Furthermore, the MIF also helps to reduce poverty, as SMEs are often the primary source of employment in rural areas.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Maharlika Investment Fund is an effective way to help SMEs access capital and grow their businesses. The fund provides loans and grants to SMEs, which can be used to purchase equipment, hire new employees, and expand their operations. Furthermore, the MIF also helps to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty. For these reasons, the MIF is an important tool for helping SMEs and the Philippine economy as a whole. <br /><br />The fund will be used for purchasing evidence like documents, witness statements, and other items that could prove a case of corruption filed against an individual or organization. <br /></p><p><strong>Explanation: <br />I apologize, I seemed to have a hard time inputting a third body paragraph but, I hope this one helps. </strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>CALCULATING INTEREST GAINED</strong><p>The formula for determining the interest gained after investing a certain amount of money can be expressed by this equation:</p>i = Prt<p>where:</p><strong>i</strong> = refers to the <strong>interest gained</strong> after t years<strong>P</strong> = refers to the initial or <strong>principal amount</strong> of money invested<strong>r</strong> = refers to the <strong>interest rate</strong> in decimal form<strong>t</strong> = refers to the <strong>number of time</strong> (months, years, etc.)<p></p><p>Let us try solving this tricky word problem involving interest with the help of our knowledge in algebra:</p><p></p><p><strong>Steve invested a sum of money at 4%. He invested twice as much at 5%. The total annual income from these investment was $210. Find the amount he invested at each rate​.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>So, let us represent the variable <strong>x </strong>as the initial amount of invested money in the first account while <strong>2x</strong> in the second account since it was stated that he invested twice as much there. Going back to the formula of interest, we can substitute them to P. For the interest rates, 4% and 5%, they are converted to 0.04 and 0.05 respectively since 4% is equivalent to 4/100 while 5% is 5/100. When a number is in percent form and you want to convert them to decimal or fraction, remember that their denominators will always be 100.</p><p></p><p>At first investment: i = Prt = x(0.04)(1) = <strong>0.04x</strong></p><p>The t is substituted by 1 since t = 1 year.</p><p>At second investment: i = 2x(0.05)(1) = <strong>0.10x</strong></p><p>Since, it was stated that the total annual income that Steve gained from these investments is 210 dollars, then we will add the two terms and equate it to 210. The equation will become:</p><p></p><p><strong>0.04x + 0.10x = 210</strong></p><p></p><p>The next step is to solve for the value of x.</p><p>Combining like terms, 0.04x and 0.10x, will result to 0.14x.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>0.14x = 210</strong></p><p></p><p>Let us divide both sides by 0.14 to isolate x. So:</p><p><strong>0.14x/0.14 = 210/0.14</strong></p><p><strong>x = 1,500</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>This means that the value of x is 1,500 and this is the amount of money that Steve invested in the first account. To obtain the value of money he invested in the second account, just multiply 1,500 by 2 and so we get 3,000.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hence, Steve invested 1,500 dollars in his first account with 4% interest rate and 3,000 dollars in his second account with 5% interest rate.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Here is another sample problem about interest rate.

                            30. essay about agricultural investment biases​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Most developing countries strive to improve agricultural productivity by relaxing credit constraints, supplying better inputs, improving marketing and distribution. However the efficacy of these reforms needs to be examined in the context of the behavioral responses of farming households. This study examines gender biases within households that affect short-term investments in agriculture. The study utilizes data from ICRISAT's village level studies in India (1975-85) to highlight the effects of child gender on the use of agricultural inputs. The main finding is that households with boys tend to use purchased inputs such as fertilizers and insecticides more intensively compared with households with girls. In general, household with boys also tend to have larger land holdings, and use animal and human labor to a greater extent than household with girls.</p><br />
