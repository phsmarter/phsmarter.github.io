Meanwhile, walke cotton and charcoal filter by crushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as tree This will remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiled water. Fialy filter the boiled water through the cotton trap. 2. People looking to lose weight have a few options: exercise, diet, weight loss pills, and surgery. Exercising involves going to a gyro, working out at home or joining some sort of class or sports team. Those who are dieting can talk to a doctor about a plan for them. Weight loss pills can be taken, if proper precautions and directions are followed. Individuals who are severely overweight can talk to a doctor about having surgery to lose the weight that they need. 3. Energy and nutrients are transferred from organism through their feedins relationship. Producers are green plants, algae or microorganism that are capable of making their own food by converting the energy from the sun into a chemical energy Producers provide energy and nutrients to the organism. Consumer get their energy by feeding on plants and other organisms. Therefore, an animals are consumers Organism that eat only plants are herbivores. Living things that eat other animals are called carnivores. Some animals which eat pants and animals are omnivores. 4. Mixing Bleach Solution First, carefully pour the bleach into the spray bottle or jar first, then add the water. Mixing the solution in this order will prevent the bleach from splashing up on you. If you get any bleach on your skin, wipe it off immediately with a damp cloth. 5. Dogs are domesticated animals that have been living with humans for generations. Dogs can be classified in a number of different ways. Most notably they can be categorized by breed. Examples of different breeds include beagles, busset hounds golden retrievers, poodles, and countless others. They can also be classified by their role in the lives of their masters and the work they do. For example, a dog might be a family pet, a working dog, a show dog or a hunting dog. In many cases, dogs are defined both by their breed and their role. For example, a dog could be a beagle that is a family pet. me heart of the text classifies and​</a>

                                            REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.

                            24. REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.
