                                            1. The enforcement of shifting scheme in classes in Luis Palad Integrated High School is aggravating as it hampers the progress of the class. It has also raised some considerations and concerns that are of course, worth noting. To accommodate the big turnout of enrollees, Paladians had to follow different schedules that eventually led to shifting in classes where students have to be divided to morning and afternoon sessions. The shifting scheme enables schools to accept more students and educate them in less crowded conditions as well as provide them with greater access to education. However, more than 6 hours of studying is quite overwhelming for them to catch up on all of their lessons and to shape their learning experiences. - “Slip of the Tongue” by Karylle Anne Cabuyao.​</a>

It has also raised someconsiderations and concerns that are of course, worth noting. To accommodatethe big tumout of enrollees, Paladians had to follow different schedules thateventually led to shifting in classes where students have to be divided to morningand afternoon sessions. The shifting scheme enables schools to accept morestudents and educate them in less crowded conditions as well as provide them!with greater access to education. However, more than 6 hours of studying is quiteoverwhelming for them to catch up on all of their lessons and to shape theirleaming experiences. - "Slip of the Tongue" by Karylle Anne CabuyaoPremise:Conclusion:​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>. 1). State the hypothesis to be tested.<p></p>You will be looking for a hypothesis that can be tested statistically.  Review the handout on statistical testing from senior seminar.  One example would be to choose two cases of something and formulate the hypothesis that they are different.  This naturally leads to a T-test.  For example, “The blood pressure of patients with hypertension will be decreased by Altase (blood pressure medicine),” or “The blood pressure of patients with hypertension will decrease more by Altase than by Brand X (blood pressure medicine).”<p></p> 2). Glassware is found in abundance in laboratories and comes in all shapes and sizes. Though it has become preferable in recent years to substitute glass vessels for cheaper, more durable and less fragile plastic materials, some substances and experiments or applications still require the use of glassware.The reasons for these are manifold. Firstly, glass is relatively inert, meaning it will not react with the chemicals or substances placed inside and thereby upset or skew the results. It is also transparent, allowing for easy monitoring, and heat-resistant, allowing for high temperatures. Furthermore, it is easy to shape and mould into any form required.<p></p>3).

                            7. 1. The enforcement of shifting scheme in classes in Luis Palad Integrated High School is aggravating as it hampers the progress of the class. It has also raised some considerations and concerns that are of course, worth noting. To accommodate the big turnout of enrollees, Paladians had to follow different schedules that eventually led to shifting in classes where students have to be divided to morning and afternoon sessions. The shifting scheme enables schools to accept more students and educate them in less crowded conditions as well as provide them with greater access to education. However, more than 6 hours of studying is quite overwhelming for them to catch up on all of their lessons and to shape their learning experiences. - “Slip of the Tongue” by Karylle Anne Cabuyao.​</h2><br />
