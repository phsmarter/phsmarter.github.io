Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyonearrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape.

Learning to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules areimportant well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules!Activity​</a>

                                            pleshActivity 1: Let's Identify!Directions: Read and analyze the texts that you are about to read. Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</a>

                                            1. Read each short text carefully and tell whether it is  expository,  persuasive, descriptive, or  narrative,  (Rx 3 points) ____1. Junks food increases cholesterol and triglyceride levels which are major risk factors for the development of heart diseases.

Junk foods also increases your risk of cancer. Don't hesitate, stop eating junk foods now! 2. Rules Foster Safety for Everyone. One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school. Leaming to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules are important well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules! ____3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing in the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise. I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel reaixed and peaceful When I want to relax in summer, i go to the beach. ____4. One sunny morning, I and my siblings started to roam around inside a zoo. A lion rushed towards us and we were frightened. Their fierce looks were frightening. After seeing them, we came across a garden in which stags and deer were frisking about. These animals were very beautiful. I could smell good things like popcorn and yucky things like manure. There were lots of people at the zoo, too. It was a fun day. I hope I can go again. ____5. A salt seller used to carry the salt bag on his donkey to the market every day. On the way they had to cross a stream. One day the donkey suddenly tumbled down the stream and the salt bag also fell into the water. The salt dissolved in the water and hence the bag became very light to carry. The donkey was happy. Then the donkey started to play the same trick every day. The salt seller carne to understand the trick and decided to teach a lesson to it. The next day he loaded a cotton bag on the donkey. Again it played the same trick hoping that the cotton bag would be still become lighter. But the dampened cotton became very heavy to carry and the donkey suffered. It leant a lesson. It didn't play the trick anymore after that day, and the seller was happy _____6.In most parts of the world, there are not so many crocodiles as there use to be This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necessary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamp and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the delimma as crocodiles have been desikred for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures people must take care of the crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.  PAKI ANSWER PLSS..​</a>

Summarize this text type based on elements of persuasive text.STORY:Why Is It Important to Follow School Rules?Every school, every classroom and every teacher has rules for students to follow, no matter the learners' ages. These rules often address responsibilities like being on time. being prepared, being courteous to staff and other students, being respectful of property, doing your best and following any other rules that the school sets forth.While some students may see the rules as unnecessary or simply a way for teachers and administrators to control them. Following school rules can be extremely important for safety. ensuring everyone has an equal chance at learning and preparing kids for the future.                Rules Foster Safety for Everyone. One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school.

                                            CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus.

Junk foods also increases your risk of cancer. Don't hesitate, stop eating junk foods now! 2. Rules Foster Safety for Everyone. One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school. Leaming to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules are important well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules! ____3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing in the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise. I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel reaixed and peaceful When I want to relax in summer, i go to the beach. ____4. One sunny morning, I and my siblings started to roam around inside a zoo. A lion rushed towards us and we were frightened. Their fierce looks were frightening. After seeing them, we came across a garden in which stags and deer were frisking about. These animals were very beautiful. I could smell good things like popcorn and yucky things like manure. There were lots of people at the zoo, too. It was a fun day. I hope I can go again. ____5. A salt seller used to carry the salt bag on his donkey to the market every day. On the way they had to cross a stream. One day the donkey suddenly tumbled down the stream and the salt bag also fell into the water. The salt dissolved in the water and hence the bag became very light to carry. The donkey was happy. Then the donkey started to play the same trick every day. The salt seller carne to understand the trick and decided to teach a lesson to it. The next day he loaded a cotton bag on the donkey. Again it played the same trick hoping that the cotton bag would be still become lighter. But the dampened cotton became very heavy to carry and the donkey suffered. It leant a lesson. It didn't play the trick anymore after that day, and the seller was happy _____6.In most parts of the world, there are not so many crocodiles as there use to be This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necessary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamp and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers have also contributed to the delimma as crocodiles have been desikred for their strong, smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures people must take care of the crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needless shooting of these animals.  PAKI ANSWER PLSS..​</h2><br />

Summarize this text type based on elements of persuasive text.STORY:Why Is It Important to Follow School Rules?Every school, every classroom and every teacher has rules for students to follow, no matter the learners' ages. These rules often address responsibilities like being on time. being prepared, being courteous to staff and other students, being respectful of property, doing your best and following any other rules that the school sets forth.While some students may see the rules as unnecessary or simply a way for teachers and administrators to control them. Following school rules can be extremely important for safety. ensuring everyone has an equal chance at learning and preparing kids for the future.                Rules Foster Safety for Everyone. One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape.

                        <strong>THE ISSUE:maybe making the rules less strict will be a lot more easier for student. THE POINT OF VIEW:this rules are also good but some of them are just way to strict.THE EVIDENCE:students can take care of themself and maybe they will learn from their own mistakes by letting them have fun and letting them learn from their mistakes THE EXAMPLE:for example no running in the hallway what if they are late? they are still gonna keep walking what if there is an emergency? maybe making it less strict wont hurt right?</strong><p><strong>Explanation: </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>issue </strong><strong> is the idea that u are weiting about the </strong><strong>point of view</strong><strong> is your opinion about </strong><strong>the issue</strong><strong> the </strong><strong>evidence</strong><strong> is the reasons you are using to support your argument the </strong><strong>examples</strong><strong> provide support and help to illustrate the reasons.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            20. CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

                        <p> </p><p></p><p> Schools are the mental concentration camps. Schools train people to accept a society where the government and other institutions tell us what to think and do.</p><p></p><p>Following school rules is extremely important for students in school. When students follow school rules it can lead to staying safe and focused.</p><p></p><p>When students in school stay focused they will most likely get a better education. Staying focused is probably not a written rule in school, but it is definitely a rule that teachers, principals, and parents want students to follow. Rules that students can follow to help stay focused include not talking in class unless told by a teacher or supervisor. When a class is unsupervised students should work on class work and ask a friend or someone who is close for help if needed.</p><p></p><p>School rules are important to maintain discipline. School rules play important role in ensuring that the students know how to behave and the consequences of misbehaving. I strongly feel that school rules are a useful guide to prevent any unwanted punishments and embarrassments.</p><p>Firstly, school rules are to make students aware of what they are not supposed to do, bring or say inside to school or in public. If students are aware of the school rules, they will know how to behave and carry themselves so as not to become a disgrace to their school. I feel that it is necessary to have school rules to maintain discipline and order in the school.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, following school rules is extremely important for students of all ages in order to get a better education. Following rules can help students stay safe and focused all day.</p><p></p><br />
