I wonder what animal made these prints," she criedm"I know, I saw the same kind of tracks two years ago. They're turtle tracks. A turtlecame to this beach and laid her eggs. Then I guess she went right back into the ocean," Paengreplied. "Let's follow the tracks and look for the nest."So they followed the tracks until they came upon the turtle's nesi."Where are the eggs?" asked Delia."The mother turtle must have covered them with sand to keep the eggs warm," repliedThey would have continued with their investigation but it was getting dark.

After they hatch, the sea turtles head towards the light. Onbeaches where people do not live, the brightest area would be the waves reflecting the light ofthe moon and the stars. So the turtles followed the house lights. We can help the turtles findtheir way to the sea if we turn off the lights at night as soon as we finish our chores.""It's a good thing we saw these sea turtles. If they continued crawling away from thesea, they would have been eaten by crabs and other animals.If they do not reach the sea, they would die from loss of water in their bodies. Comeon, let's guide the turtle to the sea," continued mother.Paeng got a lamp and to his delight the sea turtles followed the light of the lamp.When they reached the shore, Paeng waded to the sea and held the lamp.Before long, the small sea turtles scrambled into the water.

Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. “Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pandesal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESALI PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pandesal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When, suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream. 1.

My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket made of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me.

After they hatch, the sea turtles head towards the light. Onbeaches where people do not live, the brightest area would be the waves reflecting the light ofthe moon and the stars. So the turtles followed the house lights. We can help the turtles findtheir way to the sea if we turn off the lights at night as soon as we finish our chores.""It's a good thing we saw these sea turtles. If they continued crawling away from thesea, they would have been eaten by crabs and other animals.If they do not reach the sea, they would die from loss of water in their bodies. Comeon, let's guide the turtle to the sea," continued mother.Paeng got a lamp and to his delight the sea turtles followed the light of the lamp.When they reached the shore, Paeng waded to the sea and held the lamp.Before long, the small sea turtles scrambled into the water.

I enjoyed each beautiful day atid it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket inade of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. “Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pandesal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESALI PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pandesal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When, suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream. 1.
