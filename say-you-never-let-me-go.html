And promised three words you know you'll never meet Remember when I believed You meant it when you said it first to me? And now I'm pickin' her apart Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart But she's beautiful, she looks kind She probably gives you butterflies - [Chorus] I hope you're happy But not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy I wish you all the best, really Say you love her, baby Just not like you loved me And think of me fondly when your hands are on her I hope you're happy, but don't be happier - [Bridge] Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh - [Chorus] I hope you're happy Just not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy but don't be happier​                                   -Olivia Rodrigo​</a>

                                            part 6
I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

                                            Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</a>

                                            Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feels the same
That's the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me and I'm laughin' at the pain
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red"
They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade
Six-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together but I would be lost without their love
Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think and I don't do pain
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
Lay still, restless
Losing sleep while I lose my mind
All thrill, no stress
All my muses left behind (left behind)
World is below
So high up, I'm near-divine (I'm so high up)
Lean in, let go
I feel fear for the very last time</a>

                                            1)What’s in the basement?•Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet2)Mommy’s home•I heard one, a father is laying in bed after just waking up, he grabs the baby monitor and walks to his desk in his office at home, he has his baby on the baby monitor and hears his wife singing to her, he cracks a smile as he hears his wife “Go to sleep… go to sleep…” When suddenly the front door opens up and his wife comes in with groceries.3)“Yees?“•When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.I called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me​</a>

If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)</a>

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere

                                            Describe the message of Pope Francis in his homily:We have a high priest who is capable of symphatizing with our weaknesses but one who is similarly been tested in every way yet without sin. Jesus is like us. Jesus lived like us. Jesus is the same with us in every respect except sin. Because Jesus was not a sinner.But to be more like us, He assumed our condition and our sin. He made himself unto sin. This is what Saint Paul tells us. Jesus always goes before us. And when we pass and experience a cross, He passed there before us.And if today we find ourselves 14 months after, 14 months precisely after the typhoon Yolanda hit, it is because we have the security of knowing that we are not going to weaken in our faith, because Jesus has been there before us. In His passion, He assumed all our pain.I’d like to tell you something close to my heart.When I saw from Rome the catastrophe, I felt that I had to be here and on those very days I decided to come here.I am here to be with you. A little bit late, I have to say, but I am here.I come to tell you that Jesus is Lord and He never lets us down.Father, you might say to me, I was let down because I have lost so many things, my house, my livelihood. It’s true, if you would say that, and I respect those sentiments, but Jesus there (pointing to the cross), nailed to the cross, and from there, He does not let us down.He was consecrated as Lord, on that throne and there He experienced all calamities that we experienced. Jesus is Lord and the Lord from the cross is there for you.Therefore, He is capable of understanding us, as we heard in the first reading. In everything, the same as us.That is why we have a Lord who is capable of crying with us, capable of walking with us, in the most difficult moments of life.So many of you have lost everything. I don’t know what to say to you. But the Lord does know what to say to you. Some of you have lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart. Many of you have asked the Lord, why Lord?And to each of you, to your heart, Christ responds from His heart upon the cross.I have no more words to tell you, let us look to Christ, He is the Lord. He understands us because He underwent all the trials that we, that you, have experienced. And beside the cross was His mother. We are like this little child, just there.In the moments when we have so much pain, when we no longer understand anything, all we can do is grab hold of her hand firmly. And say, Mom, as a child does to a mother, when he or she feels fear.It is perhaps the only word we can say in such difficult times, Mother, Mom.Let us together hold a moment of silence, let us look to that Christ on the cross. He understands us because He endured everything. Let us look to our mother, and like that little child, let us grab hold of her mantle, and with a true heart, say, mother.In silence, let us say this prayer, say it to the mother, what you feel in your heart.(silence)Let us know that we have Mother Mary and our great brother Jesus, we are not alone. We also have many brothers who in this moment of catastrophe came to help you, and we too, because of this we feel more brothers and sisters, because we helped each other.This is what comes from my heart and forgive me if I have no other words to express this: But please know, Jesus never lets you down. Please know that the love and tenderness of Mother Mary never lets you down.And holding on to her mantle and with the power that comes from Jesus love on the cross, let us move forward, always forward, and walk together as brothers and sisters in the Lord forward.Thank you very much.​</a>

And promised three words you know you'll never meet Remember when I believed You meant it when you said it first to me?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CONSTELLATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>constellation</strong> is a region on the divine circle where a gathering of noticeable stars frames an apparent framework or example, commonly addressing a creature, legendary individual or animal, or a lifeless thing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The beginnings of the most punctual <strong>constellations </strong>probably return to ancient times. Individuals utilized them to relate accounts of their convictions, encounters, creation, or folklore. Various societies and nations embraced their own <strong>constellations</strong>, some of which endured into the mid twentieth century before the present <strong>constellations </strong>were universally perceived. The acknowledgment of <strong>constellations</strong> has changed altogether after some time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became famous, just to drop into lack of definition. Some were restricted to a solitary culture or country.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 48 conventional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Peculiarities and Ptolemy's Almagest, however their starting point presumably originates before these works by a few centuries. <strong>Constellations</strong> in the far southern sky were added from the fifteenth century until the mid-eighteenth century when European wayfarers started going toward the Southern Half of the globe. Twelve old <strong>constellations </strong>have a place with the zodiac. The beginnings of the zodiac remain generally dubious; its mysterious divisions became noticeable c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean cosmology.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is a constellation? - Brainly.ph

                            11. part 6
I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

                            17. Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me

                            18. Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feels the same
That's the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me and I'm laughin' at the pain
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red"
They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade
Six-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together but I would be lost without their love
Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think and I don't do pain
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
Lay still, restless
Losing sleep while I lose my mind
All thrill, no stress
All my muses left behind (left behind)
World is below
So high up, I'm near-divine (I'm so high up)
Lean in, let go
I feel fear for the very last time</h2><br />

                            20. 1)What’s in the basement?•Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet2)Mommy’s home•I heard one, a father is laying in bed after just waking up, he grabs the baby monitor and walks to his desk in his office at home, he has his baby on the baby monitor and hears his wife singing to her, he cracks a smile as he hears his wife “Go to sleep… go to sleep…” When suddenly the front door opens up and his wife comes in with groceries.3)“Yees?“•When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.I called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me​</h2><br />

Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go

Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing

But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey

                            27. Describe the message of Pope Francis in his homily:We have a high priest who is capable of symphatizing with our weaknesses but one who is similarly been tested in every way yet without sin. Jesus is like us. Jesus lived like us. Jesus is the same with us in every respect except sin. Because Jesus was not a sinner.But to be more like us, He assumed our condition and our sin. He made himself unto sin. This is what Saint Paul tells us. Jesus always goes before us. And when we pass and experience a cross, He passed there before us.And if today we find ourselves 14 months after, 14 months precisely after the typhoon Yolanda hit, it is because we have the security of knowing that we are not going to weaken in our faith, because Jesus has been there before us. In His passion, He assumed all our pain.I’d like to tell you something close to my heart.When I saw from Rome the catastrophe, I felt that I had to be here and on those very days I decided to come here.I am here to be with you. A little bit late, I have to say, but I am here.I come to tell you that Jesus is Lord and He never lets us down.Father, you might say to me, I was let down because I have lost so many things, my house, my livelihood. It’s true, if you would say that, and I respect those sentiments, but Jesus there (pointing to the cross), nailed to the cross, and from there, He does not let us down.He was consecrated as Lord, on that throne and there He experienced all calamities that we experienced. Jesus is Lord and the Lord from the cross is there for you.Therefore, He is capable of understanding us, as we heard in the first reading. In everything, the same as us.That is why we have a Lord who is capable of crying with us, capable of walking with us, in the most difficult moments of life.So many of you have lost everything. I don’t know what to say to you. But the Lord does know what to say to you. Some of you have lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart. Many of you have asked the Lord, why Lord?And to each of you, to your heart, Christ responds from His heart upon the cross.I have no more words to tell you, let us look to Christ, He is the Lord. He understands us because He underwent all the trials that we, that you, have experienced. And beside the cross was His mother. We are like this little child, just there.In the moments when we have so much pain, when we no longer understand anything, all we can do is grab hold of her hand firmly. And say, Mom, as a child does to a mother, when he or she feels fear.It is perhaps the only word we can say in such difficult times, Mother, Mom.Let us together hold a moment of silence, let us look to that Christ on the cross. He understands us because He endured everything. Let us look to our mother, and like that little child, let us grab hold of her mantle, and with a true heart, say, mother.In silence, let us say this prayer, say it to the mother, what you feel in your heart.(silence)Let us know that we have Mother Mary and our great brother Jesus, we are not alone. We also have many brothers who in this moment of catastrophe came to help you, and we too, because of this we feel more brothers and sisters, because we helped each other.This is what comes from my heart and forgive me if I have no other words to express this: But please know, Jesus never lets you down. Please know that the love and tenderness of Mother Mary never lets you down.And holding on to her mantle and with the power that comes from Jesus love on the cross, let us move forward, always forward, and walk together as brothers and sisters in the Lord forward.Thank you very much.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The figurative language used in the lyrics is:</p><p></p><p>Simile: "I'm in a field of dandelions, wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine." - This is a simile because it uses the word "like" to compare being in a field of dandelions to the act of wishing on every one of them, implying that the person's desire for the other person is as abundant as the dandelions in the field.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime, and I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the rarity of finding true love by saying it only comes once in a lifetime, implying that the person believes the other person is their one true love.</p><p></p><p>Metaphor: "Dandelion, into the wind you go, won't you let my darling know?" - This is a metaphor because it compares a dandelion being blown by the wind to the act of conveying a message to the person's "darling." It implies that the person is hoping the message reaches their loved one just like a dandelion disperses its seeds through the wind.</p><p></p><p>Personification: "I see forever in your eyes" - This is personification because it gives human qualities, such as seeing forever, to the eyes of the person the lyrics are addressed to. It implies a deep emotional connection and suggests that the person's eyes hold a sense of eternity.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "I've never felt so alive and free, when you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the intensity of the person's feelings when the other person is looking at them. It implies that their happiness and sense of freedom are greatly amplified in the presence of the other person.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Glad to help ^^ </p><p>pa brainly if you don't mind </p><p></p><br />
