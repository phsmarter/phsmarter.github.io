                            11. Why people may have poor oral hygiene?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Brush your teeth at least twice a day.</p><p>Smiling woman brushing her teeth.</p><p>Yes, you should brush your teeth before breakfast!</p><p>This is one of the first things we’re taught as children, and for good reason! Bacteria and saliva can build up in the mouth pretty quickly while we’re sleeping, and brushing in the morning helps get rid of this buildup, along with morning breath. On the other hand, experts recommend brushing your teeth after dinner and before bedtime as well, if you are susceptible to gum problems and to avoid plaque.</p><p></p><p>You should also spit, not rinse, since rinsing washes away the fluoride. Products such as closeup Menthol Fresh Toothpaste, or closeup Red Hot Toothpaste, have fluoride, which protects the enamel on your teeth from tooth decay and cavities, gives you fresh breath, and a bright, confident smile.</p><p></p><p>Close Up Menthol Fresh Toothpaste</p><p>closeup Menthol Fresh Toothpaste</p><p>Buy Now</p><p>Close Up Red Hot Toothpaste</p><p>closeup Red Hot Toothpaste</p><p>Buy Now</p><p>Pro tip: Dental hygienists actually recommend brushing teeth before breakfast, instead of after. The fluoride in toothpaste protects teeth from the acids and sugars you may have had, and might rub into teeth with brushing. In this instance, you may rinse your mouth with water afterwards (minty fresh breath and orange juice don’t quite go well together, after all).</p><p></p><p>2. Make flossing a daily habit.</p><p>Teeth cleaning thread.</p><p>Nope, too short! Experts recommend using at least 18 inches of floss every time. </p><p>Dental floss can reach areas that the bristles on your toothbrush can’t, so it’s important to floss daily to help prevent plaque and food between teeth that may cause bad breath and tender gums. It is recommended to floss before brushing, since flossing dislodges any buildup or food residue between teeth — you’d want to brush that stuff away after.</p><p></p><p>Gently move the floss up and down between teeth. Make sure you floss both sides of the teeth. Don’t forget to — again, gently — floss the base of your teeth. Do this by starting from the curved base and swiping upward.</p><p></p><p>Pro tip: Use 18 inches of floss every time. At this length, you’ll have enough clean sections of floss to cover all your teeth. As you near your gums, don’t forget to floss that C-shape at the base of your teeth and give it a nice, thorough cleaning. </p><p></p><p>3. Brush your tongue.</p><p>The truth is, your tongue is covered with bacteria. If bacteria can sit between your teeth, it can definitely grow on the textured surface of your tongue. It is between the taste buds that bacteria accumulate, and brushing your tongue is an important part of a good oral care routine. If a tongue scraper isn’t quite your thing, you can clean your tongue with your toothbrush and a bit of toothpaste.</p><p></p><p>Start from the back of your tongue, brush to the front, and then go all the way back again. Repeat this a few times. Cleaning your tongue reduces bacteria that cause bad breath, as well as gives you a fresh feeling in your mouth. </p><p></p><p>Pro tip: Cleaning your tongue also improves your sense of taste! If you want a more acute ability to distinguish flavors (or simply wish to enjoy food better), clean your tongue twice daily.</p><p></p><p>4. Use mouthwash — but not after brushing your teeth.</p><p>Mouthwash is a great way to freshen up and feel confident with your smile on the go. It rinses away food particles, fights against plaque between teeth and gums, and prevents cavities. It’s a common misconception to use mouthwash right after brushing.</p><p></p><p>This washes away the nice coating of fluoride you just got from your toothpaste. The fluoride needs to stay on your teeth for it to do its job, so use mouthwash at other times of the day, like after lunch. Avoid eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes after rinsing with mouthwash. </p><p></p><p>Pro-tip: Are you sure your mouthwash is giving your teeth and gums the protection they need? Check the label for fluoride! You want a mouthwash that has fluoride and a lot of them actually don’t have it. </p><p></p><p>5. Remove stains from teeth.</p><p>Prevention is always better than cure, so you could avoid drinks that stain, such as tea, coffee, or red wine — but that’s no fun. If you already have stains and don’t want any more, brush immediately after consuming these drinks with a lightening toothpaste like closeup Natural Smile Toothpaste, which has lemon essence and sea salt to naturally lighten teeth. The citric acid in lemon makes it a natural bleaching agent, while the sea salt acts as a gentle abrasive that removes stains. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Economist Richard Easterlin conducted studies on income and happiness in the 1970s and found that richer people are usually happier than poor, but only to a certain income level.

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="why-do-people-have-poor-social-skills">
                            21. why do people have poor social skills</h2><br />
                        <p>1. Ordinary topics might bore them</p><p>A major reason why intelligent people can have poor social skills is that they can’t summon up the enthusiasm to join in everyday conversations with people. Men may understand this feeling when listening to women discussing cosmetics, and women may understand it when listening to men analyze a football game.</p><p>Some highly intelligent people feel this way about most of the conversation topics of both the sexes.
</p><p>
</p><p>2.They can find it tough to find common ground with people
</p><p>Most of the interests of a highly intelligent person will be of limited interest to those of average intelligence. This can mean that subjects that would make the highly intelligent person engaging and enthusiastic in conversation are off bounds because the other person wouldn’t be able to relate.
</p><p>
</p><p>Two neuroscientists might be very animated when discussing neuroscience, for example, but totally unable to respond in a conversation about celebrity gossip.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. They’re more self-conscious
</p><p>One of the disadvantages of higher intelligence can be a higher degree of awareness of oneself and one’s behavior in social interactions. Highly intelligent people may be super conscious of themselves while socializing.
</p><p>
</p><p>Imagine if you always had critical eyes watching and judging you while you speak. You’d feel like you were on stage and you’d be unable to act naturally. For many highly intelligent people, that critic is in their own heads.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. They’re more conscious of you too
</p><p>Another character flaw that can afflict the highly emotionally intelligent is that they can be extremely aware of other people’s responses in conversation. A person with a high emotional quotient can spot the micro-expressions and subtle body language cues in other people, which show when they’re impatient, bored, or not really listening.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p> 
</p><p>This can be crippling because people don’t really listen to others and aren’t genuinely interested in them at least half of the time! Once you’re aware of this, it can be almost impossible to continue a conversation with someone.
</p><p>
</p><p>5.They’re naturally more anxious
</p><p>Many correlations have been found in research between higher levels of intelligence and increased levels of generalized as well as social anxiety. Anxiety is a major cause of poor social skills.
</p><p>
</p><p>The reasons why this might occur are open to speculation. But it could be argued that ignorance is bliss and someone who is really conscious of what the world is realizes that it is a dangerous and unpleasant place. This naturally gives rise to feelings of fear and anxiety.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. They’re uncomfortable with revealing personal info
</p><p>The more intelligent a person is, the less comfortable they may be with revealing too much about themselves to people then don’t know well. This is the logical thing to do in many ways, as we all know that there are people around who might use personal information against a person.
</p><p>
</p><p>It’s reasonable to want to know a person enough to trust them with details about your life that could place you in a position of vulnerability. This has a cost in terms of social skills, though.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p> 
</p><p>7. They hide their vulnerabilities
</p><p>Following on from the previous point, intelligent people may be extremely cautious about revealing their vulnerabilities. This kind of self-protective behavior may be learnt rather than innate in intelligent people, but intelligent people are more likely to learn from mistakes and change their behavior in response to failures.
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem with this cautious attitude is that it robs them of essential social skills. People can’t warm to people who are unwilling to reveal their humanity to others. It prevents others sharing with them too.
</p><p>
</p><p> 8.Their impassioned responses about intellectual matters can alienate them
</p><p>The problems that highly intelligent people have with social skills are not restricted only to the times when they hardly open their mouths. The real damage can occur when they do get talking.
</p><p>
</p><p>When an intelligent person gets involved in a conversation that happens to interest them, they can become so heated and enthusiastic that people think they are aggressively opinionated, or even that what they’re expressing is anger.
</p><p>
</p><p>This couldn’t be further from the truth. Intelligent people enjoy a heated debate and aren’t easily offended, nevertheless others mistake impassioned responses for aggressiveness and take offense easily.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p> 
</p><p>9. It’s hard for them to avoid conflict at some point
</p><p>A highly intelligent person often ends up in conflict with others because it’s difficult for them to let throwaway remarks about things to pass by unnoticed. Intelligent people are highly aware of the importance of ideas and how a bad idea can have terrible consequences for the human race.
</p><p>
</p><p>For this reason, they’re not likely to let you get away with saying something you haven’t thought through properly like most people would. People tend to take personal offense to being corrected in this way, even if (or especially if) they know they were wrong.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, I think but other poor people just be happy for what they have.</p>No because even if they don't have the things of wealth and don't experience a good life, they still have a happy family and a bow of love. That's enough for them to be happy despite being poor.<br />

                            23. why do poor people tend to have more children?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong></strong></p>Families in poverty, particularly those who make their living through agriculture, may have more kids as a way of supporting the family's livelihood. Children are often tasked with chores like walking to collect water, gardening, field work and animal care, even when they're very young<p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p></p>Some poor parents made some bad decisions to become poor in the first place, it's not unusual for them to make a bad decision with how many kids they should make.<p></p>More kids means better opportunity one will become successful enough to bring the family large amounts of income.<p></p>Living in low-income areas, access to subpar education, restricted access to getting life skill information from the internet (either no time, or no means), they never really realized how expensive all those cute kids will be.<p></p>They grew up with 5 siblings, they don't see it as unusual. An adult is likely to want as many kids as the family they grew up in had.<p></p>More dependents could lead to better social benefits like tax returns, and filing for government assistance.<p></p>A single parent could have a child from a multitude of spouses/relationships. I know someone with 3 kids, each one from a different father that disappeared. Every time she thinks this guy is "the one" and they want a kid, then he disappears. Seems more likely with lower-income individuals with unsure futures and daily financial struggles (not my dream date either).<br />

We look at 11 of the top causes of global poverty.</p><p>Living on less than $2 a day feels like an impossible scenario, but’s a reality for around 600 million people in our world today. Approximately 8% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, commonly defined as surviving on only $1.90 a day, or less</p><p>There is some good news: In 1990, that figure was 1.8 billion people, so serious progress has been made. While many wonder if we can really end extreme poverty, we at Concern believe the end is not only possible — but possible within our lifetimes. There’s no “magic bullet” solution to poverty, but understanding its causes is a good first step. Here are 11 of those causes, fully revised for 2020.</p><p>1. INEQUALITY AND MARGINALIZATION</p><p>“Inequality” is an easy, but sometimes misleading term used to describe the systemic barriers leaving groups of people without a voice or representation within their communities. For a population to escape poverty, all groups must be involved in the decision-making process — especially when it comes to having a say in the things that determine your place in society. Some of these may be obvious, but in other situations, it can be subtle.</p><p>Gender inequality, caste systems, marginalization based on race or tribal affiliations are all economic and social inequalities that mean the same thing: Little to no access to the resources needed to live a full, productive life. When combined with different combinations of vulnerability and hazards which comprise the rest of this list — a marginalized community may become even more vulnerable to the cycle of poverty.</p><p>2. CONFLICT</p><p>Conflict is one of the most common forms of risk driving poverty today. Large-scale, protracted violence that we’ve seen in areas like Syria can grind society to a halt, destroying infrastructure and causing people to flee (often with nothing but the clothes on their backs). In its tenth year of conflict, Syria’s middle class has been all but destroyed, and over 80% of the population now lives below the poverty line.</p><p>But even small bouts of violence can have huge impacts on communities that are already struggling. For example, if farmers are worried about their crops being stolen, they won’t invest in planting. Women also bear the brunt of conflict, which adds a layer of inequality to all conflict: During periods of violence, female-headed households become very common. And because women often have difficulty getting well-paying work and are typically excluded from community decision-making, their families are particularly vulnerable.</p><p>3. HUNGER, MALNUTRITION, AND STUNTING</p><p>You might think that poverty causes hunger (and you would be right!), but hunger is also a cause — and maintainer — of poverty. If a person doesn’t get enough food, they’ll lack the strength and energy needed to work (or their immune system will weaken from malnutrition and leave them more susceptible to illness that prevents them from getting to work).</p><p>The first 1,000 days of a child’s life (from womb to world) are key to ensuring their</p><p></p><br />

                            30. are rich people really happy because they have everything?Are poor people really sad because they don't have anythingExplain your answer 5 sentences​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>No, being rich does not guarantee happiness. You have many money, then you are may be the target of the robbers,criminals,etc. </p><p>It is not necessarily true that all poor people are sad because they don't have anything. While poverty can create challenges and limitations, happiness is a subjective experience that can be influenced by a range of factors beyond material possessions. Many people living in poverty find joy and meaning in their lives despite their circumstances, and prioritize relationships, community, and personal values over material possessions.</p><br />
