Its intent is the exploration of the nature of the materials that fabricate our physical environment, why they hold the different properties that depict them, how their atomic structure may be fathomed, and how they may be manipulated and changed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Although organic reactions have been conducted by man since the discovery of fire, the science of Organic chemistry did not develop until the turn of the eighteenth century, mainly in France at first, then in Germany, later on in England. By far the largest variety of materials that bombard us are made up of organic elements. The beginning of the Ninetieth century was also the dawn of chemistry, all organic substances were understood as all being materials produced by living organisms: wood, bone, cloth, food, medicines, and the complex substances that configure the human body. Inorganic material was believed to come from the Earth: salt, metals, and rock, just to name a few.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Because of the human’s wonder of natural life, organic materials were believed to possess an enigmatic “Vital Force.” Thus organic chemistry was separated from inorganic chemistry, and it became it’s own field of science. By the turn of the Nineteenth the “Vital Force” theory was immensely discredited, but this branch of science still stayed separated from inorganic chemistry. Back when Organic chemistry was the chemistry of living matter, Professor Wohler succeeded in synthesizing in the laboratory an organic compound previously observed in living tissue as Urea. Professor Wohler made this organic compound from non-living chemical substance, Ammonium Cyanate. He evaporated a solution of Ammonium Cyanate to produce Urea. Thus rendering the “Vital Force” theory to be with flaws. Other famous experiments proved the vitalism theory was wrong. In 1845 Kolbe synthesized acetic acid, the chief component in vinegar, in a flow of reactions starting with Carbon, the experiment is demonstrated better defined since acetic acid (C6H4O2) is a carbon-carbon bond. The theory of vitalism, like many other scientific theories, disappeared slowly under the weight of accumulated evidence rather than as a consequence of any one brilliant and enlightening experiment.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Structural theory, which developed in the 1860’s, started the second major period of growth in the organic chemistry field. The de...</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>... middle of paper ...</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>...reactions were already known and in active use to synthesize organic compounds into other compounds, only with this understanding of the nature of a chemical bond did a clear reason of the nature an mechanism of chemical reactions begin to appear. This will be clear when one realizes that the transformation of one molecule to another, a chemical reaction, requires the breaking of some bonds and the making of others. This process could not be understood until one knew what a bond is. Thus if the nineteenth century was devoted to unraveling the fixed structures of molecules, the twentieth century will be devoted to the study of their transformations.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The study of science and more specifically the study of organic chemistry is an on going affair.

What makes organic compounds unique from inorganic compounds?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Organic compounds always contain carbon while inorganic compounds contain metal and other elements. Carbon-Hydrogen bonds are the characteristic of organic compounds while these are not found in inorganic compounds. Inorganic compounds contain metal atoms while they are never found in organic compounds</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Organic chemistry is the science that deals with all aspects of organic compounds. Organic synthesis is the procedure of their preparation. The present meaning of organic compound contains a significant amount of carbon even though many of the “organic compounds” today have no association with any substance found in living organisms. There is no official meaning of an organic compound. Some books and others define an organic compound as something that contains one or more C-H bonds; others include C-C bonds in the definition.</p><br />

                        <strong>ORGANIC </strong><strong>COMPOUND</strong><p></p><p>Organic molecules are made up of carbon atoms that are covalently bound to hydrogen, frequently oxygen, and other elements. They are created by living organisms and can be found in soils, seas, commercial items, and every cell of the human body. <strong>Carbohydrates</strong>, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides are the four categories most vital to human structure and function. You must first grasp the chemistry of carbon before you can investigate these molecules.</p><p></p>Carbon's Chemical Make-Up<p></p><p>The chemistry of organic molecules' carbon core is what makes them so common. Remember that carbon atoms have four electrons in their valence shell, and the octet rule demands that atoms react in such a way that their valence shell is completed with eight electrons. By donating or absorbing four electrons, carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells. Instead, they share electrons easily through covalent connections.</p><p></p>Carbohydrates<p></p><p><strong>Carbohydrate</strong> is short for "hydrated carbon," which comes from the root hydro-, which means "water." A <strong>carbohydrate</strong> is a molecule made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; hydrogen and oxygen are found in most carbohydrates in the same two-to-one ratio as they are in water. In actuality, a "generic" <strong>carbohydrate</strong> molecule has the chemical formula (CH2O)n.</p><p></p>Monosaccharides<p></p><p>A monosaccharide is a <strong>carbohydrate</strong> monomer. The human body relies on five monosaccharides. Three of them are hexose sugars, so named because each one has six carbon atoms.</p><p></p><p>what are the organic compounds mentioned in the organic compounds </p><p>brainly.ph/question/11912161</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

                        <p>Organic and inorganic compounds are both important in our daily lives.

They include important biological molecules like carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, which are necessary for energy, cell structure, and metabolism.</p><p></p><p>Inorganic compounds, on the other hand, are compounds that do not contain carbon and are not produced by living organisms. They are important because they are the building blocks of many materials that we use in our daily lives, such as metals, glass, and concrete.

Although the virus usually first invades and infects the lung and respiratory track tissue, in extreme cases, almost all major organs in the body are now known to be negatively impacted often leading to severe systemic failure in some people. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for this disease. Pre-existing pathological conditions or comorbidities such as age are a major reason for premature death and increased morbidity and mortality. The immobilization due to hospitalization and bed rest and the physical inactivity due to sustained quarantine and social distancing can downregulate the ability of organs systems to resist to viral infection and increase the risk of damage to the immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal systems and the brain.
