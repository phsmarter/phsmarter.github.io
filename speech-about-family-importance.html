                            3. Write an informative speech about the importance of family in education, decision making and strengthening faith​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Family values are unique to each family; however, they provide families with a perspective on life, a way of viewing the world and their circumstances, as well as a sense of identity by assisting family members in better understanding their history. The fact that values are so important to families is that they can give family members a sense of hope, meaning, and significance, especially when they are faced with challenges and crisis situations, is part of the reason for this. When people aren't living their lives in a way that is consistent with their values, they may even experience feelings of despair.</p><p></p><p>A second reason that values are important is that they serve as a foundation for protection and guidance as well as affection and support.. Instilling family values can protect and guide children against making harmful decisions in the future because they teach them a sense of what is and is not acceptable. They can make a positive contribution to relationships and have an impact on judgments, behaviors, and parenting styles. A great deal of what we do and how we react to different situations and topics is influenced by our personal values. Values provide families with a perspective on life, a way of viewing the world and their circumstances, as well as an identity by assisting family members in better understanding their own history. Family involvement in planning and decision making is important because families know their child best. Family input is instrumental in making sure that the student receives appropriate support, and that necessary changes are made so they can be fully included in the classroom. Research indicates that family and community involvement in schools is associated with improvements in students' academic achievement, higher attendance rates, and improved quality of school programs, as well as improved student behavior and school discipline.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Here's an example for the topic "Importance of Education":</p><p></p><p>TOPIC SENTENCE: Education is a fundamental aspect of human life.</p><p></p><p>OPENER/INTRODUCTION: Good day everyone. Today, I would like to talk about the importance of education.</p><p></p><p>BODY: Education is an essential ingredient in developing individuals and societies. It is through education that people gain knowledge, skills, and values that enable them to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. The benefits of education are vast, from personal growth to social and economic development. For one, education can improve people's lives by giving them a better understanding of the world around them. It allows them to make informed decisions and think critically. Moreover, education can unlock opportunities for people, such as higher-paid jobs, improved health outcomes, and increased participation in civic life.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why education is essential is that it builds character, instills values, and shapes attitudes. Education cultivates a sense of responsibility, respect for others, and a desire for lifelong learning. Also, it promotes tolerance, empathy, and understanding between cultures and communities. Education can foster social cohesion and harmony, which are critical in building peaceful and prosperous societies.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, education is an investment in the future. It is through education that we can address the complex challenges facing our world, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. By equipping people with the right skills and knowledge, education can help create a more sustainable and equitable world.</p><p></p><p>AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, education is crucial in shaping the future of individuals and communities. It empowers people to fulfill their potential, contribute to society, and make a positive impact on the world. Therefore, let us all recognize the importance of education and work to ensure that everyone has access to quality education and lifelong learning opportunities. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
