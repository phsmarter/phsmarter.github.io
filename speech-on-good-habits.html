Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells ofanimals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When thishappens, the virus uses the cell's chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible forcausing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. Inconclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.7. It is definitely frightful to be infected with COVID-19. Though a large number ofpatients experience mild symptoms, turning it to a severe condition is still a possibility. I could notimagine a patient to experience chest pain, loss of speech or movement, and difficulty in breathingWhat is worse is the patient is all alone when he or she experiences all these struggles. Furthermore,anxiety and self-pity add to the struggle of the patients. Therefore, in order to avoid such conditions,let us not put our guards down from COVID-198. Cooking spaghert is very simple.

Crocodiles came from the family of Crocodilia while alligators came from the familyof Alligatoridae. In terms of their habitat, crocodiles prefer to live in saltwater while alligators live infreshwater like rivers and lakes. The main reason for this geographical separation is that Crocodileshave well-developed salt glands on their tongue that expel large amounts of sait, enabling them tolive in more salty waters. However, alligators' salt glands don't function well, leading them to stick tofreshwater habitats. Another way to differentiate the two is by looking at the shape of their snoutsCracodiles have long pointed V shaped snouts while alligators have rounded U-shaped snouts. Thesefeatures make crocodiles and alligators distinct from each other.10. Despite the problems brought by the pandemic, it has undeniably cultivated certainFilipino values.

                                            Read the letter below. This was given by Justice Felix Frankfurter to a 12-year old boy from Virginia who was thinking of going into law studies. No one can be a truly competent lawyer unless he is a cultivated man. If I were you, I would forget about my technical preparation for the law. The best way to prepare for the law is to come to the study of the law as a well-read person. This alone can one acquire the capacity to use the English language on paper and in speech with the habits of clear thinking which only a truly liberal education can give. No less important for a lawyer is the cultivation of imaginative faculties by reading poetry, seeing great paintings, in the original or in easily available reproductions, and listening to great music. Stock your mind with the deposit of much good reading, and widen and deepen your feelings by experiencing vicariously as much as possible the wonderful mysteries of the universe, and forget all about your future career. Answer the following reflection questions: 1. Why did the Justice advise the boy to forget about his technical preparation for the law?2. What is meant by “cultivation of imaginative faculties?”  3. Although you may not be going into law school, do you think you still need to stock your mind with the deposit of much good reading? Why or why not? 4. What is achieved by reading poetry, seeing great paintings, and listening to great music?5. What then is a “cultivated man” based on the letter of Justice Felix Frankfurter?Sana po may mag answer ng maayos, ASAP.​</a>

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Ang galing ha?pati performance task mo ako pa pinagawa  Sabihin mo yan lahat ha?TITLE: Harmful Impacts of Technology Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Today, I would like to talk to you about the harmful impacts of technology on our lives. Technology has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate, but it has also had negative consequences that we cannot ignore.Firstly, technology can have a detrimental impact on our physical health. With the advent of smartphones and other mobile devices, many people spend long hours sitting in front of screens, leading to eye strain, headaches, and back pain. Furthermore, excessive use of technology has been linked to poor sleep quality, which can lead to fatigue, mood swings, and decreased productivity.Secondly, technology can also have a negative impact on our mental health. Studies have shown that social media use is linked to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Social media can also create a sense of constant comparison, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.Thirdly, technology can have a negative impact on our relationships. Many people are so engrossed in their devices that they neglect their loved ones, leading to a breakdown in communication and a loss of intimacy. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to bully and harass others online, which can have devastating consequences.Fourthly, technology can have a negative impact on our environment. The production and disposal of electronic devices contribute to the growing problem of electronic waste, which can have serious environmental consequences. Moreover, the energy consumption associated with the use of technology is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which exacerbate climate change.In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly brought many benefits to our lives, we cannot ignore its harmful impacts. It is crucial that we use technology responsibly and consider the potential negative consequences of our actions. By doing so, we can ensure that we harness the power of technology for good while minimizing its harmful effects on our lives and the environment. Thank you for your attention.<p></p><p></p><br />

Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells ofanimals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When thishappens, the virus uses the cell's chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible forcausing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. Inconclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.7. It is definitely frightful to be infected with COVID-19. Though a large number ofpatients experience mild symptoms, turning it to a severe condition is still a possibility. I could notimagine a patient to experience chest pain, loss of speech or movement, and difficulty in breathingWhat is worse is the patient is all alone when he or she experiences all these struggles. Furthermore,anxiety and self-pity add to the struggle of the patients. Therefore, in order to avoid such conditions,let us not put our guards down from COVID-198. Cooking spaghert is very simple.

Crocodiles came from the family of Crocodilia while alligators came from the familyof Alligatoridae. In terms of their habitat, crocodiles prefer to live in saltwater while alligators live infreshwater like rivers and lakes. The main reason for this geographical separation is that Crocodileshave well-developed salt glands on their tongue that expel large amounts of sait, enabling them tolive in more salty waters. However, alligators' salt glands don't function well, leading them to stick tofreshwater habitats. Another way to differentiate the two is by looking at the shape of their snoutsCracodiles have long pointed V shaped snouts while alligators have rounded U-shaped snouts. Thesefeatures make crocodiles and alligators distinct from each other.10. Despite the problems brought by the pandemic, it has undeniably cultivated certainFilipino values.

It has mountains, valleys, and fields rich with crops and minerals. It has rivers, waterfalls, and seas abundant in fish and precious sea products. It abounds in enchanting beaches, caves, and tourists' spots. It is no wonder that the Philippines is called the "Pearl of the Orient Seas." 12. The apple orchard was beautiful on the spring morning. Tiny white blossoms dotted the trees. The green grass sparkled with dew. Mist drifted against the faraway mountains. 13.

We had a great time on the raft ndel The ride begins with a walk up a double flight of stairs. Then, riders wait until a raft comes up the conveyor belt. A lifeguard helps people onto the raft, Once the green light comes on, all it takes is push to get the raft sliding into the deep, dark tunnel. After sliding through a few twists and turns, the raft emerges back into the light and riders find themselves in a small pool - and ready to go again! 18. Dogs are often called as man's best friend. The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with best friendships, was fomed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. People are of great value to dogs too. Dogs that live with people usually have easier access to food and safer place to stay than they would their own, and that truly is what friends are for. 19. Writing names in a smooth bark can harm a tree. Diseases can attack the tree through the cuts in the bark. Trees can die because of these diseases. 20. Many children in the city go to school.

                            17. Read the letter below. This was given by Justice Felix Frankfurter to a 12-year old boy from Virginia who was thinking of going into law studies. No one can be a truly competent lawyer unless he is a cultivated man. If I were you, I would forget about my technical preparation for the law. The best way to prepare for the law is to come to the study of the law as a well-read person. This alone can one acquire the capacity to use the English language on paper and in speech with the habits of clear thinking which only a truly liberal education can give. No less important for a lawyer is the cultivation of imaginative faculties by reading poetry, seeing great paintings, in the original or in easily available reproductions, and listening to great music. Stock your mind with the deposit of much good reading, and widen and deepen your feelings by experiencing vicariously as much as possible the wonderful mysteries of the universe, and forget all about your future career. Answer the following reflection questions: 1. Why did the Justice advise the boy to forget about his technical preparation for the law?2. What is meant by “cultivation of imaginative faculties?”  3. Although you may not be going into law school, do you think you still need to stock your mind with the deposit of much good reading? Why or why not? 4. What is achieved by reading poetry, seeing great paintings, and listening to great music?5. What then is a “cultivated man” based on the letter of Justice Felix Frankfurter?Sana po may mag answer ng maayos, ASAP.​</h2><br />
