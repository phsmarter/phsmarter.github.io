                            15. My father's boss is a peculiar man. On one occasion, the employees heard their boss's telephone ring. It reag several times but no one answered it. It seemed as if no one was there. Someone opened the door to his office. There, inside, the employee the ringing telephone. “Sir , the telephone, please. “Yes, yes," and he walked to the door as if someone were waiting outside for him. “No, sir. I mean the telephone." “What? Oh, yes, I was about to answer it, but I was thinking of the accounts you gave me, I'm afraid that I have lost them.” The papers comprising the statement of accounts were in his hand.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The single incident that is the focus of the story is when the employees heard their boss's telephone ringing but found out that he had it with him in his office and was unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>2. The observation by the author that reinforces this incident is the boss's absent-mindedness, which is highlighted by the fact that he had the telephone with him but did not realize it was ringing.</p><p></p><p>3. This incident brings out a general truth about human beings, which is that we can sometimes become so absorbed in our thoughts and tasks that we become unaware of our surroundings. This can result in absent-mindedness and forgetfulness, as demonstrated by the boss in the story. It is a reminder that we need to be mindful of our actions and surroundings, especially in situations where our attention is divided between different tasks.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO ^^</p><br />
