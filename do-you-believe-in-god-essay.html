                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes, he made everything in the world and he also took on our sins and he is our only one who is safe, good -hearted and forgiving.</p><p></p><p>2. It is good that religion is uniting these people, but they are still only being united with other people who believe in the same religion. People will only go to their own place of worship and the different religions will still be divided. ... Religion tends to divide people more than it unites people.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. As a christian believer who accept Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior, yes I do believe that God really exist. But some people do not believe that God exist because they are people who don't know God, the people who don't have faith. John 3:16 "For God so love the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life". </p><p>2. Religions, such as Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, have often been proclaimed by their believers as a unifying force, one that transcends gender, race and physical borders. However, these religions have also been seen to be the case of conflict and divisions around the world. Religion ideally serves several functions. It gives meaning and purpose to life, reinforces social unity and stability, serves as an agent of social control, promotes psychological and physical well-being, and may motivate people to work for positive social change.</p><p>3. Definitely yes, it helps us to be a good and a better person. It also helps us to  grow, not only physically, but also mentally and spiritually. Religion can also give people a sense of purpose. It can affect them by making them want to dedicate their lives to accomplishing some sort of good in the world.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th century German philosopher, interprets life as amounting to suffering in his work "The World as Will and Representation." He argues that the fundamental aspect of existence is not the rational, conscious self, but rather the underlying will to live, which he refers to as the "will to exist." This will is the source of all suffering, as it drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer believes that the will to exist makes life more insufferable by constantly creating new desires and needs that can never truly be satisfied, resulting in a state of constant dissatisfaction. He states, "Desire is never satisfied by the satisfaction of a desire; indeed, the satisfaction of one desire is but the beginning of another" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.88). He also believes that suffering outweighs pleasure in life because suffering is more intense and longer-lasting than pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer rejects God as a source of meaning in life because he argues that the concept of God only serves to perpetuate the cycle of suffering caused by the will to exist. He states, "If God were to grant us all our desires and needs, we would only desire for more and greater things" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.89). He also argues that love is not capable of providing meaning because it is ultimately driven by the will to exist and therefore leads to suffering.</p><p></p><p>Despite his assertion that life is meaningless, Schopenhauer does not advocate for suicide as an appropriate choice. Instead, he advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. He suggests that individuals should focus on cultivating a sense of detachment and detachment from the will to exist, which he believes can lead to a state of contentment and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>However, one could argue that Schopenhauer's views are overly pessimistic and fail to take into account the positive aspects of life such as love, joy, and compassion. Additionally, his emphasis on detachment and denial of desires can be seen as a rejection of human nature and a failure to fully engage with the world.</p><p></p><p>Personally, while I acknowledge the validity of Schopenhauer's argument that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience, I believe that it is important to also recognize and appreciate the positive aspects of life. Therefore, I do not fully agree with his views.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Schopenhauer's interpretation of life as amounting to suffering is rooted in his belief that the fundamental aspect of existence is the will to live, which drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment. He rejects God and love as sources of meaning in life and instead advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. However, his views have been criticized for being overly pessimistic and for rejecting human nature.</p><br />
