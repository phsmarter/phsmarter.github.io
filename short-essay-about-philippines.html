                            1. Short essay about Philippines ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Philippines is a sovereign archipelago country in South East Asia situated in the Western Pacific Ocean. The country is divided into three geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. These group of islands houses picturesque and breath-taking views. We have the perfect cone-shaped Mayon Volcano in Albay, the crystal-clear waters of Maria Cristina Falls in Iligan, the man-made stairway to heaven of Banaue Rice Terraces, the route to another dimension through Palawan’s Underground River, the powder-white sand of Boracay in Aklan, and the bumpy Mt. Pinatubo trek in Sta. Juliana, Capas. Who would not be amazed by these natural wonders? These are just examples. We have more.</p><p> </p><p>The Philippines also boasts an exceptional culture! Prior to Spanish colonization in 1521, Filipinos already had a rich culture and were trading with nearby super countries like China and Japan. The mixture of different traditions and influences made the Philippine culture dynamic and diverse. We have relics and traditions that serve as witnesses to this legacy: the 500-year-old Magellan’s cross in Cebu, the 400-year-old foundation of faith in Quiapo church, the colorful Masskara Festival in Bacolod, and the world’s longest Christmas celebration lasting four months. I rest my case!</p><p> </p><p>Our greatest treasure perhaps is our people. We Filipinos are well-known for our hospitality. We value new connections and cherish these relationships.  We value respect. We have the age-old tradition of pagmamano, a way of honoring our parents and elders through speech and symbolic gestures. We value hard work and industry. We are persevering people. No typhoon can drag us down. No earthquake can tear us apart. We face the calamities of life wearing a smile with optimism as our armor.</p><p> </p><p>Welcome to the Philippines. Welcome to the family.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Population Explosion In The Philippines</p><p>             Population explosion is considered as one of the undisputable alarming obstacles that stand on the path of the less developed countries. These countries produce great numbers in terms of human resources because the birth rate is much higher than in the rich countries, but the rate of employment and production in the poor countries is very low. Definitely this is a very serious problem that the government should never take for granted.</p><p>             The Philippines belong to the group of these "less developed countries." And as we all know, the growth of population in our country is unstoppable. In fact, the Philippine population is one of the fastest growing countries in the world. It is estimated that 3,000 Filipino babies are born every day, 100,000 every month, or one million a year to round up the figures. There are more babies being born today than there were in the 1970s. There will be more babies born 20 years from now than the number of babies that are born this day. In this lies the problem: at first, the babies need milk, diapers and vitamins. But the trouble is, babies grow up. And when they do, they need education, which requires more school structures; they need food, clothing, houses, jobs, etc. These are basic needs that must be filled. Providing them creates a large number of problems that demand the fullest utilization of the nation's resources.</p><p>             This rapid growth of population is quite hard to endure for it really affects both the social and economic condition of our country. However, population growth cannot be controlled easily because of cultural and religious reasons, not to mention, the Philippines is known to be very conservative and very much Catholic, in its broadest sense. The Filipinos are truly bound to their being "Christians" that their minds are closed to the idea of contraceptives as one of the ways of family planning (to avoid the rapid increase of the population</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope It Help's.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:
</p><p>
</p><p>The arguments for coercion to consume merit goods include the potential for people to act irrationally, increasing consumption of important goods for the beneficiaries and maximization of social welfare. Social welfare is the most critical argument for the Covid-19 vaccines viewed as merit goods. The global loss from the Covid-19 pandemic is huge and will grow if the world fails to control the spread of the disease. There are both positive and negative externalities in imposing the Covid-19 vaccines. Positive externalities include additional protection to large populations, which can reduce infection transmission, thus reducing health workers’ burden and freeing up spaces in hospitals for non-Covid-19 patients. It also reduces both private and public costs for patients’ treatment and prevents productivity loss from infected people.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An indigenous tribe of Philippine mountain people has lived in seclusion for centuries. They have made the mountains their home and survived off the land and its bounty. </p><p></p><p>The tribe openly welcomed the modern world when it reached their doorstep a few decades ago. While they accepted the new technology, they also kept their traditional way of life intact. Their language was protected, and they welcomed outsiders and visitors with open arms.</p><p></p><p>The mountain people revere nature and all that it provides – from the fruits and vegetables they grow, to the wildlife that share their home. They live in harmony with nature and respect the laws of their ancestors. </p><p></p><p>One day, a group of environmental activists visited the tribe to learn more about their way of life. The tribe was surprised to see outsiders interested in their ways, but they willingly shared their stories and customs. The activists were inspired by what they heard and promised to help protect the tribe and their land. </p><p></p><p>Inspired by this act of kindness, the mountain people decided to give back too. They began sending monthly donations to local animal sanctuaries in the area to help preserve nature's balance. There was nothing that made them happier than knowing that they were doing their part in protecting nature's harmony, just like their ancestors taught them to do.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> <strong>HOPE </strong><strong>IT </strong><strong>HELPS </strong><strong>PA </strong><strong>BRAINLIEST </strong><strong>THANKS </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For thousands of years, indigenous people have inhabited the Philippine archipelago. These communities have developed unique cultural traditions and practices that reflect their deep connection to the land and their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Despite their rich cultural heritage, indigenous people in the Philippines have faced significant challenges in recent decades. Many have been displaced from their ancestral lands due to large-scale development projects, mining operations, and other forms of resource extraction. This displacement has led to the loss of traditional knowledge and practices, as well as social and economic marginalization.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, many indigenous communities in the Philippines continue to fight for their rights and their way of life. They have organized themselves into advocacy groups and have sought legal recognition of their rights to their ancestral lands and resources. They have also worked to preserve their cultural heritage through traditional practices, music, dance, and storytelling.</p><p></p><p>Today, there is a growing recognition of the importance of protecting the rights and cultural heritage of indigenous people in the Philippines. The government has passed laws and policies aimed at recognizing and protecting the rights of indigenous communities, and many organizations and individuals are working to support these efforts.</p><p></p><p>Through their resilience and determination, indigenous people in the Philippines continue to contribute to the cultural diversity and richness of the country, while also advocating for their rights and the protection of their ancestral lands and resources.</p><br />

                            15. short essay about internet connection in the Philippines using evaluative language ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipinos need internet connectivity more than ever as most professionals are now working from home and as students start taking their classes online. However, the internet in the Philippines remains unreliable. Most people find their connection slow, unavailable, and quite frustrating. Why is that so?</p><p></p><p>How Fast is Philippine Internet?
</p><p>According to an Ookla Speedtest in August 2020, the Philippines ranked at the lower part of the global index in terms of average broadband and mobile speeds. At 16.44Mbps for mobile downloads, the country landed the 199th spot out of 139. With 25.34Mbps for broadband, we landed at the 106th place out of 174.</p><p></p><p>The Price of Internet in the Philippines
</p><p>Despite having the second cheapest mobile data per gig in the Asia Pacific, the internet in the Philippines also remains quite expensive. In the Digital Quality of Life Index 2020, the Philippines lands at the 82nd place, out of 85 spots in terms of internet affordability.
</p><p>
</p><p>The study also reveals that it takes 1,994 seconds of work to get the cheapest mobile internet and 75 minutes of work to afford the cheapest broadband internet in the country.</p><p></p><p>So Why is Internet in the Philippines Expensive?</p><p>The country has over 7,000 islands making it difficult to construct fixed networks.
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, the process of building cell towers is extremely time-consuming and hard. You need to get to layers of bureaucracy before a permit is approved. First, you need to get a permit from the barangay where the cell tower will be built then you would need to get various permits at the city or municipal level. You also need another set of permits and approvals from various national agencies.
</p><p>
</p><p>On average, 25 to 30 permits from Local Government Units (LGUs) are needed to build just one cell site. The process also takes approximately eight months.
</p><p>
</p><p>In other countries, governments actively invest in ICT infrastructures to provide better internet service to their citizens. While the Philippine government is doing its part to improve every Filipino’s connectivity, much of the burden is still carried by the private sector.
</p><p>
</p><p>Additionally, there are only two major internet companies in the country. Despite having various internet service providers, PLDT and Globe still have the biggest market share. In fact, Globe hits an all-time high market share of 84.4% in the first quarter of 2019 for its home broadband.
</p><p>
</p><p>In August, the House of Representative granted DITO Telecommunity a 25-year franchise, allowing the company to operate in the country. The China-led company is said to be the third telco company that will the long-standing telco monopoly in the country.</p><p></p><p>Final Thoughts
</p><p>These days, fast and reliable internet is essential. While internet in the Philippines continue to be one of the slowest and most expensive globally, new technologies are on their way to make Filipinos more connected than ever. Until they reach our soil, let’s keep our fingers crossed a better internet connection in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Folk performing arts range from vocal and instrumental music, dance and drama. It is one of the important genres of folklore. They include numerous cultural expressions that reflect human creativity and that are also found in many other intangible cultural heritage domains. It involves one’s ability to stand back from where he or she is to become more aware of cultural values, beliefs, and perceptions. Preserving these values, beliefs, and traditions can pose a great challenge especially today when culture has become vulnerable because of globalization.Philippine culture is exceptional and unique in nature. It was also discussed that culture separates its distinction from the rest of the world since the country showcased colorful and lively culture that makes distinctly Filipino. This includes traditions, language, arts, music, literature, etc. which are found in museums, churches, and galleries within the heart of the key cities. Also, provinces have their own identifying folk dances showcasing the elegance and beauty of the way people do things, dress, and illustrate different paintings as they have been influenced by events that happened in history.The preservation of the cultural heritage of one country is as important as the understanding of the historic wealth where the culture comes from. This signifies the essence of culture in one country down to the people living within. Culture individually affects people on the different questioning of how and where such a thing came from. These also cater to the balance of the atmosphere of the historic past experience that will harmonize modern society today. Moreover, the law tells that culture is one of the inspirationsto steward the present and the future.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>hope it helps&lt;3</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>---&gt;|ANSWER|&lt;---</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet.</strong><strong>Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signalling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a "buzzing" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.<br /><br /><br />AND PLS SUB TO MY CHANNEL RONALDOMG AND RONALD KURZAWA</strong><strong>GAMERGIRL</strong><strong>SIS VS BRO</strong><strong>KARINA KURZAWA.</strong><strong></strong><strong>ANSWERED by: RONALDOMG</strong><strong></strong><strong>#CARRY on learning</strong><strong>#Stay safe and have faith</strong><strong>#Brainliest</strong><br />
