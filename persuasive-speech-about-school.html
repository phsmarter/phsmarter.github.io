                                            Should students be required to wear a uniform to school? That is the question that has been raised for discussion here today.Private schools have long been known for having school uniform policies. Now some public schools such as ours are deciding whether or not they want their students to wear a school uniform.Some people argue that requiring students to dress a certain way takes away their sense of creativity and individuality. However, there are several strong arguments in favor of schools requiring school uniforms.Wearing a school uniform can encourage some students to take their responsibilities more seriously.If they wear the same clothes to school that they wear when they go to the mall with their friends, they may have the same laid back attitude in both places.Students may take school more seriously, teasing and violence can be decreased, and you may even save some money.Please keep these benefits in mind when you vote today!1.

A Homeless Man One day, I saw a homeless man in the subway. He was a little bit different from other homeless people. When he came into our car, he started making a speech about how hard he had tried to find a job, how difficult it was to do so, how hungry he was, and so on. Then, he sang a song with a sad low voice. It sounded pitifully throughout the car. Moreover, his speech was so persuasive that people could not help feeling sympathy. As a result, most people there gave him some change, or even a dollar. His paper cup was filled with money in a minute. The Educational System in Burma During my father's generation, the education system was very different. Back in those days, more schools were provided by the government. In those days, people had a better education than nowadays because teachers had different ways of teaching. Most of the students were taught by British teachers. Therefore, they spoke better English and had high standards in English. Also, they began learning English in primary school. Furthermore, all of the subjects were taught in English. The schools' rules were strictly followed, and the administrators had punishments for every little thing. Now, the educational system is far different from my father's. For example, all the subjects are taught in Burmese, except for English. I, myself, and other students started to learn English in the fifth grade. In the fourth and eighth grades, our final exams were given by the state board of education, and in the tenth grade, our exam was a nation-wide exam. In each grade, we have to pass every subject. Otherwise, we have to repeat that particular grade. Therefore, it can be really difficult to graduate from high school. After tenth grade, we can enter college. In the old days, there was no limit in choosing any major or professional field that students wanted. However, things are not as easy in my generation. The students have fewer opportunities to learn and fewer careers from which to choose​</a>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Persuasive speech on school uniforms</p><p></p><p>I believe that having a school uniform would be a good thing for multiple reasons. The first being how it would completely and utterly eradicate the issue of dress code. The next reason is how it would be able to create a more focused learning environment by eliminating clothing distractions.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p></p><p>Today, I am here to talk to you about the importance of school uniforms.</p><p></p><p>First of all, let me ask you a question: why do we have schools in the first place? Is it not to provide a safe and conducive environment for children to learn and grow? A school uniform is one way to ensure that this environment is maintained.</p><p></p><p>When students wear uniforms, they are immediately identifiable as part of the school community. This promotes a sense of belonging and unity among students. It also helps to reduce bullying and other forms of aggression, as students are not able to judge each other based on their clothes.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, school uniforms promote equality among students. In a world where children can sometimes be judged based on the clothes they wear or the things they own, a school uniform levels the playing field. It ensures that all students are treated the same, regardless of their socio-economic background.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these benefits, school uniforms can also save parents money. Instead of having to buy their child a new wardrobe every season, parents can simply purchase a few sets of uniforms that can be worn year-round. This can be a significant financial relief for many families.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps most importantly, school uniforms help to create a sense of discipline and order in the school. When students are dressed in the same clothes, they are more likely to focus on their studies and less likely to get distracted by their appearance or the clothes of their peers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, school uniforms promote unity, equality, and discipline in the school community. They provide a safe and conducive environment for children to learn and grow. Let us support the use of school uniforms and help our children get the most out of their education. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>brainliest please thank you!!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is of vital essence in our world today, with most focus directed to making sure all individuals get access to education. Many parents are putting a lot of effort in getting the best education for their kids, as long as they can afford so that they can be successful. One of the most controversial topics in education today is whether traditional schooling or homeschooling is better and if both are equals. Many people have argued against homeschooling because of variety of reasons. For most parents, traditional schooling is the norm for the society, although some have different views and prefer homeschooling. They are the best way for the future as it provides student centered education, that is adaptive to the needs of the students. This paper seeks to discuss on traditional and homeschooling, and while both have a main goal of producing the best performances, they quite differ in terms of meeting the child’s needs, the learning environment, physical activities, and the aspect of socializing.</p><p></p><p>Traditional schooling is the oldest educational system that has preferences to homeschooling by some people. The traditional schooling is also termed as public schooling, and the cost for learning here are much less compared to homeschooling. This is because the government pays most of the tuition fees, and the parents are left with little responsibilities like buying uniform’s and maintaining their kids. This kind of education system favor’s all the children from humble and rich backgrounds. Besides that, in public schooling, the level of student socialization is high. The children meet with many kids from diverse background from all parts of the region. From this, they get to know and interact with each other, although their cultural and languages differ. In addition, public schooling sponsors most of extra-curricular activities like sporting, club, and participating in bands, that widens the experience of the kid, making them grow healthy and with enough confidence.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlist po</p><p></p><p><strong>ito po ang answer ko thank you po pa brainly na lang</strong></p><br />

These reasons must in turn be supported by facts and evidence. As this is a speech, make sure to use cohesive devices, emphasis markers and include the rhetorical devices and techniques​​</h2><br />
                        <p>Good day, fellow students. Today, I stand before you as a delegate to discuss a critical issue that affects each and every one of us - limited face-to-face classes in the next school year. As we face this unprecedented situation, it is essential that we raise our voices and express our opinions about it.</p><p></p><p>My stand is clear: we must fight for more face-to-face classes in the next school year. As we all know, face-to-face learning is an essential aspect of our education. It provides us with the opportunity to interact with our teachers and classmates, ask questions, and receive immediate feedback. It allows us to learn more effectively and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter.</p><p></p><p>I have three reasons to support my stand, and I hope that they will convince you of the validity of my argument.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, limited face-to-face classes may have a detrimental effect on our mental health. Over the past year, we have all experienced the challenges of online learning - the isolation, lack of motivation, and difficulty in concentrating. With limited face-to-face classes, we may feel even more disconnected and may struggle to cope with the challenges of virtual learning.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, online learning may not be suitable for all students. While some may thrive in a virtual learning environment, others may struggle. This may be due to a lack of access to technology or a lack of support from their families. Limited face-to-face classes may exacerbate these issues and widen the gap between students who can adapt to online learning and those who cannot.</p><p></p><p>Finally, limited face-to-face classes may affect our academic performance. Research has shown that students who participate in face-to-face classes perform better academically than those who do not. Face-to-face learning allows us to engage in discussions, work collaboratively with our peers, and receive individualized support from our teachers. These opportunities may be limited in an online learning environment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, we must fight for more face-to-face classes in the next school year. Limited face-to-face classes may have a detrimental effect on our mental health, may not be suitable for all students, and may affect our academic performance. It is essential that we raise our voices and express our opinions about this issue. Let us work together to ensure that we have access to the education we deserve. Thank you.</p><p></p><br />

                            13. Should students be required to wear a uniform to school? That is the question that has been raised for discussion here today.Private schools have long been known for having school uniform policies. Now some public schools such as ours are deciding whether or not they want their students to wear a school uniform.Some people argue that requiring students to dress a certain way takes away their sense of creativity and individuality. However, there are several strong arguments in favor of schools requiring school uniforms.Wearing a school uniform can encourage some students to take their responsibilities more seriously.If they wear the same clothes to school that they wear when they go to the mall with their friends, they may have the same laid back attitude in both places.Students may take school more seriously, teasing and violence can be decreased, and you may even save some money.Please keep these benefits in mind when you vote today!1.

He was a little bit different from other homeless people. When he came into our car, he started making a speech about how hard he had tried to find a job, how difficult it was to do so, how hungry he was, and so on. Then, he sang a song with a sad low voice. It sounded pitifully throughout the car. Moreover, his speech was so persuasive that people could not help feeling sympathy. As a result, most people there gave him some change, or even a dollar. His paper cup was filled with money in a minute. The Educational System in Burma During my father's generation, the education system was very different. Back in those days, more schools were provided by the government. In those days, people had a better education than nowadays because teachers had different ways of teaching. Most of the students were taught by British teachers. Therefore, they spoke better English and had high standards in English. Also, they began learning English in primary school. Furthermore, all of the subjects were taught in English. The schools' rules were strictly followed, and the administrators had punishments for every little thing. Now, the educational system is far different from my father's. For example, all the subjects are taught in Burmese, except for English. I, myself, and other students started to learn English in the fifth grade. In the fourth and eighth grades, our final exams were given by the state board of education, and in the tenth grade, our exam was a nation-wide exam. In each grade, we have to pass every subject. Otherwise, we have to repeat that particular grade. Therefore, it can be really difficult to graduate from high school. After tenth grade, we can enter college. In the old days, there was no limit in choosing any major or professional field that students wanted. However, things are not as easy in my generation. The students have fewer opportunities to learn and fewer careers from which to choose​</h2><br />

As a delegate, you have been selected to deliver a persuasive speech that motivates students to voice out their opinion about having limited face- to-face classes in the next school year. The speech must include a clearly declared stand (an action for the listener to take regarding the issue), and at least three reasons seeking to convince the audience of the validity of the stand. These reasons must in turn be supported by facts and evidence. As this is a speech, make sure to use cohesive devices, emphasis markers and include the rhetorical devices and techniques​</h2><br />
                        <p>Dear fellow students,</p><p></p><p>As we look towards the upcoming school year, we are faced with an important question: should we continue to have limited face-to-face classes, or should we push for more in-person learning? As a delegate to this youth conference, I believe that we should voice our opinions and advocate for more in-person classes. Today, I urge you to join me in taking action to ensure that we receive the education that we deserve.</p><p></p><p>My first reason for advocating for more face-to-face classes is that students learn better in a physical classroom environment. Research has shown that students are more engaged and motivated when they are in a classroom with their peers and teachers. Additionally, being in a classroom allows for more opportunities for hands-on learning and face-to-face interaction with teachers. In-person classes allow for a better understanding of complex topics and increased student-teacher communication.</p><p></p><p>My second reason for pushing for more face-to-face classes is that not all students have access to the technology needed for online learning. Many students do not have reliable internet access, a quiet space to study, or a computer that is capable of running video conferencing software. By limiting in-person classes, we are creating a situation where students who are already at a disadvantage are being further marginalized.</p><p></p><p>My third reason for advocating for more face-to-face classes is that the social aspect of school is an important part of the educational experience. Students need to interact with their peers and build social skills, which is difficult to do in an online setting. Additionally, extracurricular activities and clubs play a vital role in the development of well-rounded students, and these are difficult to run in an online-only setting.</p><p></p><p>As you can see, there are many reasons why we should push for more in-person classes. It is important that we voice our opinions and advocate for the education that we deserve. We must work together to ensure that our voices are heard and that we receive the best possible education. Let us take action and work towards a brighter future for ourselves and future generations.</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><br />

To convince the reader, use emphasis markers to show importance about whatare trying to pinpoint. If you have trouble finding a topic, answer one of the followquestions1. What school policy would you change or enact if you could?2. Who is the greatest historical figure of all time in the Philippines?3. Should public school students wear uniforms?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I would change the wearing of school uniforms due to the fact that some students are not comfortable wearing them and that would lead them to not focusing properly in school. Although we still need to follow the dress code. And most people now a days express how they feel through the way they dress. Feeling comfortable makes us focus more and it makes us be ourselves better. </p><p>2. In my opinion, it is Jose Rizal because even our past heroes said that Jose Rizal's sacrifice was the biggest one of all. He persuaded filipino's to fight harder and dream bigger through his novels, stories, etc. He was very smart and he helped filipino's so much, let's not forget that he loves Philippines so much. </p><p>3. For me, I think no because as I said earlier they might not be comfortable and some students can't afford uniforms. Although it is up to them because I am just stating my opinions and probably they like uniforms better, but wearing what you're comfortable with helps a lot because your mind is gonna get motivated and it will want to learn more. </p><p></p><p>Hope this helps </p><br />
