                        <p>800 - Word essay about cyberbullying </p><p></p>AnswerIn my opinion, it’s too early to say, the rise of reported bullying cases is a consequence of the reporting requirements of the law.  Bullying cases is rampant, however, it remain under reported prior to the anti-bullying act. This is understandable, since no parents or even school administration would like his/her family or school to be famous because of bullying.
  Schools, however, to mitigate the effects and reduce the incidence of bullying, should comply with the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-bullying law of 2013 to address the root causes of bullying. Any severe or repeated use by one or more students of a written, verbal or electronic expression, or a physical act or gesture, or any combination thereof, directed at another student that has the effect of actually causing or placing the latter in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to his property; creating a hostile environment at school for the other student; infringing on the rights of the other student at school; or materially and substantially disrupting the education process or the orderly operation of a school; such as, but not limited to, the following:

a. Any unwanted physical contact between the bully and the victim like punching, pushing, shoving, kicking, slapping, tickling, headlocks, inflicting school pranks, teasing, fighting and the use of available objects as weapons;

b. Any act that causes damage to a victim’s psyche and/or emotional well-being;

c. Any slanderous statement or accusation that causes the victim undue emotional distress like directing foul language or profanity at the target, name-calling, tormenting and commenting negatively on victim’s looks, clothes and body; and

d. Cyber-bullying or any bullying done through the use of technology or any electronic means.#BRAINLY.PH<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The phrase nature vs nurture relates to the relative importance of an individual 's innate qualities, compared to an individual 's personal experiences and how either of these affect individual differences, especially in behavioral traits. Project Nim was an experiment conducted on a chimpanzee to discover...The debate between nature vs nurture is one of the longest and most heated ones in the history of psychology. The terms "nature" and "nurture" refer to the roles of environment and heredity in the development of a human psyche. Since the early stages of psychology scholars have divided into...Nature vs. Nurture The dubious history of the heredity environment controversy can be easily traced as far back as the start of the present century with at least some argumentative essay regarding how nurture affects our development, rather than our nature, which is our genetics we acquire.Nature verses Nurture are both concepts of what makes us who we are today. Nature is described as our physical attributes and genes from when we are born. Our genetics that make us who we are include our eye colour, height and hair colour, as well as our natural talents, abilities and our intelligence level. Nurture refers to our physical and social worlds that influence our childhood with our surroundings and our environment we were brought up in from birth An example of both these is my mother who is a single parent. She was stereotyped from the beginning, being a single parent back than meant her children would be raised in an unfair and disadvantaged environment and wouldn’t have the support we needed to grow which turns out was completely untrue. With our physical attributes I was given the short genes my brother the tall genes, both of us have blue eyes and brown hairs. With regards to our environment thought we grew up in a normal surrounding nothing different from a two parent family. The only difference was I believe we were closer as a family, more open to each other’s views, yes mum worked two jobs but at the same time we spent a lot of time together as much as any family would. Now at the age of 25 and 23 my brother is applying for the police force and I am here studying what I’ve always wanted to do. A lot of theorists are stuck in the middle of the nature verses nurture. Some believe it’s a biological factor ultimately responsible for human growth. Others believe that children become whatever the environment shapes them to be.

Food security refers to the availability, accessibility, and affordability of nutritious food for all individuals. As the world's population continues to grow, it is essential that we find ways to produce more food while also protecting the environment and preserving natural resources. Sustainable agriculture practices are key to achieving this goal.</p><p></p><p>Sustainable agriculture is a holistic approach to farming that takes into account the environmental, economic, and social impacts of food production. It involves using techniques that minimize the use of synthetic inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and instead focus on building healthy soil and promoting biodiversity. This approach also prioritizes the well-being of farmers and their communities by ensuring fair wages and working conditions.</p><p></p><p>One of the main benefits of sustainable agriculture is that it helps to preserve natural resources and protect the environment. Conventional farming practices often rely heavily on the use of synthetic inputs, which can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. In contrast, sustainable agriculture practices such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and conservation tillage help to build healthy soil, reduce erosion, and preserve natural habitats.</p><p></p><p>In addition to protecting the environment, sustainable agriculture also helps to ensure food security by increasing the productivity of small-scale farmers. Many small-scale farmers around the world lack access to the resources and technologies needed to increase their yields. Sustainable agriculture practices, such as agroforestry and intercropping, can help to increase productivity and income for small-scale farmers, which in turn can help to improve food security in these communities.</p><p></p><p>Another benefit of sustainable agriculture is that it can help to reduce poverty and promote social justice. The majority of the world's small-scale farmers are women, who often face additional challenges such as lack of access to land, credit, and training. Sustainable agriculture practices can help to empower women farmers by providing them with the resources and training they need to increase their productivity and income.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sustainable agriculture is a critical aspect of achieving food security for the growing global population. It helps to protect the environment, increase productivity, and promote social justice. Governments, international organizations, and the private sector all have a role to play in supporting sustainable agriculture practices and promoting food security. By working together, we can ensure that all people have access to nutritious food and that our planet remains healthy for future generations.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dengue is a life-threatening disease. It is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito called Aedes. Its bite takes an epidemic form causing a tremendous situation. Dengue is a virus fever originating from Africa. It is a fear in the tropical countries like Bangladesh. Burma, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines etc.</p><p></p><p>Places of laying eggs: Aedes mosquitoes lay their eggs on stagnant water in the well, in the absconded pots, polythene bags, in the holes of a tree where rainwater remains, on the rotten things, on the heap of waste materials etc.</p><p></p><p>Kinds and symptoms of dengue fevers: Dengue fever is of Iwo kinds— classical dengue fever and, hemorrhagic dengue fever. The temperature of classical dengue rises 104–105 celsius. The victim or the patient being attacked with classical dengue fever feels a backache, headache, rashes, and loss of appetite. There is no bleeding in classical dengue fever.</p><p>Don’t Forget to Check: Essay in English</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>But hemorrhagic dengue fever is quite serious than the former. The severe illness is suspected to be due to double infection with the viruses. Other symptoms of DHF include accumulation of reddish spots on the body. The victim always feels pain, loss of appetite, serious headache all over the body and vomiting.</p><p>The WHO guidelines: According to WHO guidelines, if the patient level falls to 15000 or 10000 сmm, a transfusion is necessary. A dengue patient is advised to drink fluids and to take Intravenous saline until the patient’s condition becomes normal. If the fluid volume drop is too low, the patient goes into shock and may die. Shock syndrome occurs when the low volume of blood causes less oxygen to go into the tissue. The patient’s body may get cold and clumsy, blood pressure may fall, and the pulse rate becomes rapid and weak. Bado</p><p></p><p>Prevention: To cure a dengue patient prevention is a better means. The following are the preventive measures to be adopted in this regard. Containers should be covered to prevent mosquitoes and flies from their access and laying eggs.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Both air-conditioner and air cooler need to be kept neat and clean so that mosquitoes cannot take shelter there. The portable water pitchers and containers should be kept upside down. Mosquito bite should be checked by ringing up the curtail or mosquito net or using mosquito repellents.  People should be especially careful about both at morning and at evening.</p><p></p><p>Dengue specialists predict that one-third of the Dhaka households are carrying Aedes mosquitoes breeding space. The city corporation should collect monitoring reports from every household and take special steps against it. Aedes mosquitoes breed mainly in man-made containers like earthen pot, metal drums, plastic containers, used automobile tires and other things in which rainwater remains stagnant.</p><p></p><p>People of all classes should be made alert and awareness should be created among them so that they may keep their home and homesite neat and clean. But in case of a seriously dengue attacked patient, he should immediately be taken to a hospital or health clinic/complex for proper treatment. The first aid can be managed as a primary treatment.</p><p></p><p>Dengue devastation in various places: Dengue devastation has especially be marked in recent years but it had been identified as far back as in 1966. A project is known as Integrated Vector Borne Disease Control Project (I.V.B.D.C.P) supported by WHO detected the dengue virus in Chittagong. Then 25 patients were detected to be seriously attacked with dengue fever.</p><p></p><p>Then in 1977-78, the ICDDRB detected dengue virus in some people in Mohammadpur area. Dengue fever paralyzed the city of Dhaka with fear. The panic, of course, justified was considering that there was no effective care of the disease and that any group was suspicious of it. The whole countrymen were afraid of dengue. oot ar</p><p></p><p>Treatment: Medical science has advanced far in the field of treatment. The dengue attacked patient needs a few tests to diagnosis the nature of dengue fever. The arrangement of first aid should be made. The patient should be encouraged. The serious patient must be hospitalized at an early date.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Mark </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>as </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>brainliest</strong></p><p><strong>Correct</strong><strong> me</strong><strong> if</strong><strong> I'm</strong><strong> </strong><strong>wrong</strong></p><p><strong>I </strong><strong>don't </strong><strong>know</strong><strong> </strong><strong>if </strong><strong>that's </strong><strong>8</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>0</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or </strong><strong>more</strong><strong> </strong><strong>than</strong><strong> </strong><strong>8</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>0</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Question:</strong></p><p><strong>What is or are the importance of biomolecules?</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>These molecules carry out or initiate critical metabolic events in living organisms. Understanding the physiological function that governs the appropriate growth and development of a human body may be gained through researching biomolecules. Biomolecules are significant because they regulate practically every element of organisms. From structure to energy function. Carbon, protein, lipid, and nucleic acid are the four categories of biomolecules. Biomolecules provide a wide range of tasks, including energy storage, protection, and so on. When we talk about biomolecules, we generally refer to four types: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. There are distinct functions for each kind. Proteins, for example, serve as the functional center of the cell. Enzymatically boosting chemical processes, acting as various channels, and clamps and so on- they basically carry out the cell's "activities." Lipids are additional structural components of the cell; they play a role in the formation of "walls," or membranes of live cells. Lipids are also excellent insulators and energy storage materials. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are employed as a major source of energy since they are easier to catabolyze. As a result, carbs function more like energy storage. Nucleic acids are utilized to convey genetic information from one generation to the next. A biomolecule, often known as a biological molecule, is any of the various compounds created by cells and living creatures. Biomolecules come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and they serve a wide range of functions. Carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins are the four primary categories of biomolecules. All biomolecules have a basic link between structure and function, which is modified by factors such as the environment in which they occur. Because lipids are hydrophobic in water, many spontaneously organize themselves in such a manner that the hydrophobic ends of the molecules are shielded while the hydrophilic ends are exposed. Lipid bilayers, or two layers of phospholipid molecules, form the membranes of cells and organelles as a result of this arrangement. In another instance, consider DNA, which is an extremely long molecule in humans; the aggregate length of all the DNA molecules in a single cell stretched end to end would be around 1.8 meters, whereas the cell nucleus is approximately 6 meters in diameter—has a highly flexible helical structure that allows the molecule to become tightly coiled and looped. This structural feature plays a key role in enabling DNA to fit in the cell nucleus, where it carries out its function in coding genetic traits. The human body is made up of around 30 trillion cells that work together to accomplish the main processes of life. These life-sustaining processes are carried out by the cells with the assistance of many organic compounds found within them. Biomolecules are the name given to these organic compounds.</strong></p><p><strong>Biomolecules come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and they play a variety of roles in life. They are made up of about 25 naturally occurring elements, the most important of which being carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.</strong></p><p><strong>Lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins are examples of biomolecules. Biomolecules are required by all living beings. They exist because bio implies life. Each biomolecule in your body is used by your body to maintain homeostasis. Each biomolecule has its own monomer, which are small molecules that may create lengthy chains that can form polymers, which are multiple monomers bound together; monomers are connected together by a chemical process known as dehydration synthesis. Biomolecules are those that are produced by living things and are required for their daily activities. They are fundamentally reliant and rely on interruption to function. They are typically composed of basic components known as monomers, which artificially solidify to form large and complicated polymers. The fundamental components that make up the majority of biomolecules are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</strong></p><p><strong>Biomolecules are produced by living organisms and are produced for functional reasons. Biomolecules, or at least the vast majority of them, do not exist outside of living creatures because they are too complicated to be formed by random chemical collisions. The chances of a single average-sized protein forming by chance are 1 in 10 to the 77th power. To form, biomolecules REQUIRE intelligent agency.</strong></p><p><strong>Biomolecules are an organism's molecular base (building block/foundation). Consider an organism to be a compound, with biomolecules serving as the particles that combine to create the compound. There would be no aggregation and hence no organism if these biomolecules did not exist. Biomolecules are the fundamental components of living beings.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><strong> Hope it helps.</strong></p><p><strong>Correct me if i'm wrong</strong></p><p></p><br />

As I looked at the videos, I discovered that without art, there is no culture. The skill and desire to render images are uniquely human. I also learned the term iconography which means the study of the symbols or messages and the underlying story or context of an image or art. I get to know the various historical art and artists through the video "70 Million" by Hold Your Horses. This video demonstrates appreciation of various arts through recreation. I learnt about John Baldessari and his short background in the third video. John Baldessari has been dubbed as the godfather of conceptual art, master of appropriation, and surrealist for the digital age. I also learned that it is important for the people to look at art because we live in a visual world. It is interesting to look at and appreciate art and to think about how objects communicate. The importance you pay to objects, whether they're newspaper pictures, artworks from museum, or nature makes us a better person. In a more aware, alert. environment, we live. Many people sometimes believe that looking at art means going to a museum or art gallery, but in fact, art is everywhere. We can find art on the streets, in architectural places, or even in our homes. Thus, art is in our everyday lives. Moreover, art is about noticing. It is about how to see the hidden message in each artwork. We jus need to look a little deeper on the details and deeply understand the art.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>HOPE </strong><strong>IT </strong><strong>HELPS</strong><strong> </strong><strong>YOU</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PABRAINLIEST</strong><strong> </strong><strong>NALANG </strong><strong>PO </strong><strong>SALAMAT^</strong><strong>^</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Title: The Importance of Freedom of Expression in a Democracy</p><p></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Today, I would like to talk to you about the importance of freedom of expression in a democracy. As we all know, freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that allows individuals to express themselves freely without fear of censorship or punishment. It is a cornerstone of any democratic society, and it is essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy.</p><p></p><p>A democracy is built on the principle of the people's participation in governance. And for the people to participate effectively, they need to have access to information and the ability to express their opinions. This is where freedom of expression comes in. It allows individuals to voice their opinions, share their ideas, and participate in public discourse. Without this freedom, the people are not able to hold their leaders accountable and make informed decisions.</p><p></p><p>Freedom of expression also plays a crucial role in promoting diversity and tolerance. In a society where different voices are heard, people are exposed to different perspectives and ideas. This exposure helps to break down stereotypes and prejudices, and it allows people to understand and appreciate the diversity of human experience. Moreover, it allows people to learn from the mistakes of the past and to build a better future.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, freedom of expression is essential for the development of science, art and culture. When people are free to express themselves, they are able to create new ideas, new technologies, and new forms of art. This creativity and innovation is what drives the growth and development of society. Without freedom of expression, society would be stagnant and backward.</p><p></p><p>However, it is important to remember that freedom of expression is not an absolute right. It is a right that comes with responsibilities. People must use this freedom responsibly, and they must respect the rights of others. They must also be aware that certain forms of expression, such as hate speech, are not protected by the freedom of expression and can lead to serious consequences.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, freedom of expression is a fundamental right that is essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy. It allows individuals to participate effectively in governance, promotes diversity and tolerance, and drives the development of science, art, and culture. We must all work together to protect and promote this right, and to use it responsibly. Thank you.</p><br />

However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror. The implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) came on the heels of serious negligence — namely, the authorities failing to keep up with the preventive measures of neighboring countries and grossly underestimating the virus.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Electromagnetic waves or EM waves are waves that are created as a result of vibrations between an electric field and a magnetic field. In other words, EM waves are composed of oscillating magnetic and electric fields.</p><p>Electromagnetic waves are formed when an electric field comes in contact with a magnetic field. They are hence known as ‘electromagnetic’ waves. The electric field and magnetic field of an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular (at right angles) to each other. They are also perpendicular to the direction of the EM wave. </p><p></p><p>EM waves travel with a constant velocity of 3.00 x 108 ms-1 in vacuum. They are deflected neither by the electric field, nor by the magnetic field. However, they are capable of showing interference or diffraction. An electromagnetic wave can travel through anything - be it air, a solid material or vacuum. It does not need a medium to propagate or travel from one place to another. Mechanical waves (like sound waves or water waves), on the other hand, need a medium to travel. EM waves are 'transverse' waves. This means that they are measured by their amplitude (height) and wavelength (distance between the highest/lowest points of two consecutive waves). </p><p>The highest point of a wave is known as 'crest', whereas the lowest point is known as 'trough'. Electromagnetic waves can be split into a range of frequencies. This is known as the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of EM waves are radio waves, microwaves, infrared waves, X-rays, gamma rays, etc.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pwede pa brainliest please</p><p>by the way,stay safe and sound..</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>try mo essaytyper.com para sa mga essays mo :D sana makatulong! :)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang nasyonalismo ay isang konsepto na kung saan ang isang indibidwal ay nagtataguyod at nagmamalasakit sa kanyang bansa at kultura. Ito ay nakatuon sa pagpapahalaga at pagtatanggol sa kagustuhan at kagalingan ng isang bansa, at sa pagpapalaganap ng pagkakaisa at pagkakakilanlan ng mga mamamayan nito. Sa panahon ngayon, ang nasyonalismo ay patuloy na nagiging mahalaga sa mga paksang pampolitika at pangkultura.</p><p></p><p>Ang nasyonalismo ay maaaring magdulot ng mga positibong epekto sa isang bansa. Ito ay nakapagbibigay ng mga pagkakataon upang mapalawak ang kaalaman ng mga mamamayan tungkol sa kasaysayan, kultura at tradisyon ng kanilang bansa. Sa ganitong paraan, nakatutulong ito upang mapanatili ang pagkakaisa at pagkakakilanlan ng mga mamamayan ng isang bansa. Bukod dito, ang nasyonalismo ay nakapagbibigay rin ng inspirasyon sa mga mamamayan upang magsumikap at magbigay ng ambag sa pagpapaunlad ng kanilang bansa.</p><p></p><p>Gayunpaman, mayroon din mga negatibong epekto ang nasyonalismo, lalo na kung ito ay nagiging dahilan ng pagkakahiwa-hiwalay ng mga bansa o pagkakawatak-watak ng mga mamamayan sa loob ng isang bansa. Sa kasalukuyang panahon, mayroon mga pangyayari kung saan ang mga extremistang grupong nasyonalista ay gumagawa ng karahasan at kaguluhan upang ipagtanggol ang kanilang mga paniniwala. Ito ay maaaring magdulot ng hindi magandang epekto sa bansa at mamamayan nito.</p><p></p><p>Sa kasaysayan ng mundo, may mga naganap na mga pagkakataon kung saan ang nasyonalismo ay nagdulot ng mga malalang konflikto at giyera. Halimbawa, noong panahon ng Unang Digmaang Pandaigdig, ang nasyonalismo ay isa sa mga pangunahing dahilan ng pagkakaroon ng giyera. Ang labanan para sa pagpapalaya ng mga bansa at mga kolonya ay nagdulot ng malalang digmaan na nagdulot ng maraming pagkamatay at pagkasira ng mga lupain.</p><p></p><p>Ngunit, sa kabila ng mga negatibong epekto ng nasyonalismo, hindi ito dapat ituring na kabuuan ng negatibong konsepto. Sa katunayan, ang nasyonalismo ay maaaring maging isa sa mga paraan upang mapangalagaan at mapalaganap ang pagkakakilanlan ng isang bansa at kultura. Ang pagpapahalaga sa mga kasaysayan, kultura, at tradisyon ng isang bansa ay nagbibigay ng malaking kontribusyon sa pagpapaunlad</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            19. death of salesman 800 words summary​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman addresses loss of identity and a man's inability to accept change within himself and society. The play is a montage of memories, dreams, confrontations, and arguments, all of which make up the last 24 hours of Willy Loman's life. The play concludes with Willy's suicide and subsequent funeral.</p><p></p><p>Miller uses the Loman family — Willy, Linda, Biff, and Happy — to construct a self-perpetuating cycle of denial, contradiction, and order versus disorder. Willy had an affair over 15 years earlier than the real time within the play, and Miller focuses on the affair and its aftermath to reveal how individuals can be defined by a single event and their subsequent attempts to disguise or eradicate the event. For example, prior to discovering the affair, Willy's son Biff adored Willy, believed all Willy's stories, and even subscribed to Willy's philosophy that anything is possible as long as a person is "well-liked." The realization that Willy is unfaithful to Linda forces Biff to reevaluate Willy and Willy's perception of the world. Biff realizes that Willy has created a false image of himself for his family, society, and even for himself.</p><p></p><p>Willy is not an invincible father or a loyal husband or a fantastically successful salesman like he wants everyone to believe. He is self-centered. He fails to appreciate his wife. And he cannot acknowledge the fact that he is only marginally successful. Hence, Willy fantasizes about lost opportunities for wealth, fame, and notoriety. Even so, it would be incorrect to state that Miller solely criticizes Willy. Instead, Miller demonstrates how one individual can create a self-perpetuating cycle that expands to include other individuals. This is certainly the case within the Loman family. Until the end of the play, Willy effectively blocks the affair out of his memory and commits himself to a life of denial. He cannot remember what happened, so naturally he does not understand why his relationship with Biff has changed. Willy wants Biff's affection and adoration as before, but instead the two constantly argue. Willy vacillates, sometimes criticizing Biff's laziness and ineptitude, other times praising his physical abilities and ambition.</p><p></p><p>Linda and Happy are also drawn into the cycle of denial. Linda is aware of Willy's habit of reconstructing reality; however, she also recognizes that Willy may not be able to accept reality, as shown through his numerous suicide attempts prior to the beginning of the play. As a result, Linda chooses to protect Willy's illusions by treating them as truth, even if she must ignore reality or alienate her children in doing so. Happy is also a product of Willy's philosophy. Like Willy, he manipulates the truth to create a more favorable reality for himself. For example, when Happy tells everyone that he is the assistant buyer, even though he is only the assistant to the assistant, he proves that he has incorporated Willy's practice of editing facts.</p><p></p><p>Miller based Willy's character on his uncles, Manny Newman and Lee Balsam, who were salesmen. Miller saw his uncles as independent explorers, charting new territories across America. It is noteworthy that Miller does not disclose what type of salesman Willy is. Rather than drawing the audience's attention to "what" Willy sells, Miller chooses to focus on the fact that Willy is a "salesman." As a result, Miller expands the import of Willy's situation. Willy is an explorer — conqueror of the New England territory — and a dreamer, and this allows the audience to connect with him because everyone has aspirations, dreams, and goals.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang <strong>kalamidad</strong> ay itinuturing na mga pangyayaring nagdudulot ng malaking pinsala sa kapaligiran, ari-arian, kalusugan, at ng mga tao sa lipunan. Ang anumang klase ng kalamidad ay maaaring umatake kahit kailan.  
</p><p>Tulad na lang dito sa ating bansa sa Pilipinas na taon-taon ay napipinsala ng mga <strong>kalamidad</strong>, tulad ng malalakas na bagyo at lindol. Ngunit masasabi nating tila normal lamang ito at nagiging bahagi na rin ng ating buhay.
</p><p>Ang mga <strong>kalamidad</strong> na ito ay nagdudulot man ng pagkawasak at pagkasira ng mga ari-arian at kumukuha pa ng buhay ng tao, sa mga pagkakataong ito naman nabubuhay ang iba’t ibang uri ng pagkakawangga, pagtutulungan at pagkakaisa ng lahat. Tila ang mga <strong>kalamidad</strong> ay isa lang pagsubok sa atin kung gaano tayo katatag at kalakas harapin ang lahat ng pagsubok na dumarating sa ating buhay.  </p><p>Sa mga ganitong panahon, hindi dapat tayo magsisihan dahil walang sinuman ang may gusto ng ganitong uri ng kapahamakang dala ng kalikasan. Maging handa na lamang tayo dahil wala namang nakakaalam kung kalian ito darating.  </p><p>Ang dapat lang natin gawin ay ang pangalagaan ang ating kalikasan, maging responsable sana tayo at maging disiplinado. Mas maging mapagmahal at madisiplina sa kalikasan. Iwasan na ang mga gawain nakasisira dito kabilang ang di wastong pagtatapon ng mga basura, pagputol ng mga puno, at paggamit ng mga nakalalasong kemikal at kung anu-ano pang maaring makasira sa kalikasan na ipinahiram lang sa atin ng Panginoon.
</p><p>Kailangan na nating kumilos dahil kung ang mga tao ay magiging pabaya, mas malala pang mga <strong>kalamidad</strong> ang ating mararanasan na laong makapamiminsala at maging sanhi ng tuluyang pagkawasak ng daigdig.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Volunteering to serve the community is not only beneficial to the individuals involved but it is necessary in creating better societies for all. For instance, community members may volunteer to clean up a town near them or feeder roads.</p><p></p><p>This way, all members benefit by living in a clean environment which is free from illnesses related to sanitation. By cleaning the compounds surrounding them, society members help promote the health of their young ones who are always playing during which time they can eat anything on the ground which would have otherwise caused them serious infections.</p><p></p><p>Community work does not always revolve around environmental work but it is equally important for the fortunate members of the society to help those who are less fortunate. Community members may volunteer to offer gifts and other services to help the less fortunate ones.</p><p></p><p>For example, people may contribute goods such as clothes and food stuffs to help the street children who have no homes or take it to children’s’ homes from where they can be provided for. This way, the members of the society will have helped others live a more and better comfortable life.</p><p></p><br />

                            29. Essay about blind student 800-1200 words help</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The challenges faced by blind students in accessing education are immense. While there are assistive technologies available to help them navigate their way through the learning process, these are not always accessible or affordable. In this essay, we will explore the challenges faced by blind students and what can be done to support their education.</p><p></p><p>Blind students face many challenges in accessing education. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of accessibility of educational materials. Many textbooks and other educational materials are not available in braille or other accessible formats. This makes it difficult for blind students to keep up with their peers and can lead to them falling behind in their studies.</p><p></p><p>Another challenge faced by blind students is the lack of access to visual materials such as diagrams, charts, and graphs. These are important tools used in many subjects, such as science, mathematics, and geography. Blind students may struggle to understand these concepts without access to the same visual aids as their peers.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, blind students face challenges in accessing technology. Many digital resources are not designed with accessibility in mind, and the cost of assistive technologies can be prohibitive for many families. This can limit the learning opportunities of blind students and make it difficult for them to keep up with their peers.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, there are many ways to support blind students in their education. One approach is to ensure that educational materials are available in accessible formats. This can include braille, audio recordings, and digital formats that are compatible with screen readers. By making educational materials accessible, blind students can access the same resources as their peers and keep up with their studies.</p><p></p><p>Another approach is to provide access to visual materials. This can include descriptions of visual aids or the provision of tactile aids such as 3D models or raised maps. These tools can help blind students understand concepts that are traditionally presented visually and provide them with the same learning opportunities as their peers.</p><p></p><p>In addition, assistive technologies can be used to support blind students. These technologies can include screen readers, text-to-speech software, and Braille displays. While these technologies can be expensive, they are essential for blind students to access educational materials and participate in classroom activities.</p><p></p><p>Another way to support blind students is through accommodations in the classroom. This can include providing extra time for exams, assigning a note-taker, or allowing the use of assistive technologies. By making these accommodations, blind students can participate in classroom activities on an equal footing with their peers.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it is essential to provide training and support to teachers and other educational professionals. Many educators may not be familiar with the needs of blind students or the assistive technologies available to support them. By providing training and support, educators can better understand the needs of blind students and provide the necessary accommodations to support their learning.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, blind students face many challenges in accessing education. However, with the right support, these challenges can be overcome. By providing accessible educational materials, access to visual aids, assistive technologies, classroom accommodations, and training and support to educators, we can ensure that blind students have the same learning opportunities as their peers.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa Brainliest po.</p><p>follow for more.</p><p>or message me.</p><br />

Our environment consists of all living beings as well as their surroundings. A healthy environment is one that is sustainable for a long period of time. It is the source of life for everyone. It directs the life of everyone and determines the proper growth and development.
</p><p>
</p><p>The good or bad quality of our life is depending on the quality of our natural environment. Our need for food, water, shelter, and other things depends on the environment around us. There must be a balanced natural cycle that exists between the environment and the lives of human beings, plants, and animals.
