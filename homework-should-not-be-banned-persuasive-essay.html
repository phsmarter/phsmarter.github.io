                            1. should we ban homework :  does homework promote learning?  (Persuasive speech)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer in explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>while to some it seems logical to ban homework-- I'm afraid that's not as true as it seems, homework is in many ways beneficial; it helps students take what they learn outside of school in a place where they might look at the information differently and have more time to learn from it. For example, a student may feel distracted at school but have a more quiet place to learn at home, and practicing the things they learn can stick with them through life. </p><p></p><p>That's an example, in a persuasive speech its important to keep the attention of whoever is reading while still covering the main points, having a strong argument is most important when you try to persuade someone.</p><br />

                            2. Arguementative essay about homeworks should not be banned in highschool</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research, React, Write</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  Research - In research you gather data. These are collection of statements from both sides of the arguements. Group your data into "who said it?", like the goverment (DepEd, Congressmen, or other politicians) , teachers or educators,  the students, and the parents. Then divide it into pro-homework and anti-homework. </p><p>News articles in the internet have recorded opinitions of DepEd and of local politicians. For teachers and students, you can interview your teachers and fellow students.</p><p></p><p>2. React - Validate which statement makes sense to you as a student. Then, group it into supportive arguments, these are statements you will add supportive response to; and against arguments, these are statements you will provide defensive statements againts.</p><p>Example:Homework help students demonstrate freely their deeper undestanding of the lesson by allowing them to apply the lesson to the questions provided in their own pace.</p><p>Your response: I agree with this because you remove the pressure of fellow students expecting you to know the answer right away</p><p></p><p>3. Write - With sufficient data and analysis, you will be able to present an informed and an intelligent argumentative essay. Remember to keep sentences short but clear. And it must be orderly, so the reader can understand the sequence of your statements, like knowing which argument support which statement.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>4.Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p><p></p><p>5.One of the valuable reasons why homework should be banned is the fact most teachers fail to explain everything needed to solve the task during the class. Parents cannot help with every task. Student's friends lack the experience to help, and they have work to do.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me, if im wrong. </p><p>hope it helps!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cheating in school has become a prevalent issue, and it not only undermines the integrity of education but also deprives students of learning valuable life skills such as honesty, hard work, and responsibility. Therefore, it is essential to establish a system of punishment that is effective in deterring cheating behavior and promoting academic integrity.</p><p></p><p>One of the most common forms of cheating in school is cheating on exams. Students who cheat on exams undermine the fairness and validity of the assessment process, and this behavior can have a detrimental effect on the student's academic performance and future prospects. Therefore, it is necessary to establish strict penalties for students who cheat on exams.</p><p></p><p>One effective punishment for cheating on exams is to invalidate the student's test results and require the student to retake the exam under strict supervision. Additionally, schools could implement a policy of zero-tolerance for cheating on exams, which could result in the student being suspended or expelled from school. These consequences would serve as a powerful deterrent to students who might be tempted to cheat.</p><p></p><p>Cheating on homework assignments and projects is also a significant problem in schools. These assignments are intended to help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and time-management skills. Cheating on these assignments undermines the purpose of the assignment and deprives students of the opportunity to develop these skills. Therefore, schools should establish a system of penalties for students who cheat on homework assignments and projects.</p><p></p><p>One effective punishment for cheating on homework assignments and projects is to give the student a failing grade for the assignment or project. Additionally, the student could be required to redo the assignment or project, and their grade would be reduced accordingly. Schools could also implement a policy of reporting cheating incidents to colleges and universities, which could impact the student's future academic and career prospects.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cheating in school is a significant problem that needs to be addressed with effective punishments. It is essential to establish a system of penalties that is strict enough to deter cheating behavior and promote academic integrity. By punishing students who cheat on exams, homework assignments, and projects, we can ensure that they learn the valuable life skills of honesty, hard work, and responsibility, and we can protect the integrity of the education system</p><br />

                            7. Write a persuasive essay on the topic Homework is necessary giving two reasons against the topic</h2><br />
                        <p>Homework is a topic that has been heavily debated for decades. Some argue that it is necessary for students to succeed, while others believe it is an unnecessary burden. In this essay, we will explore two reasons why homework is not necessary.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework can be harmful to a student's mental health. With the increasing amount of homework being assigned, students are being put under immense pressure to perform. This can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression. Students should be able to enjoy their free time after school and pursue other interests, such as sports or hobbies, which can benefit their mental and emotional well-being.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework may not always be an effective way of learning. Some students may struggle to complete homework tasks independently and may not have access to resources that can help them. This can lead to frustration and a lack of understanding of the material. Classroom instruction and discussion can be more beneficial for some students as it provides an opportunity to ask questions and receive immediate feedback.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, homework is not always necessary and can have negative effects on a student's mental health and learning. Schools should consider alternative methods of learning and assessment to provide a more well-rounded education for students.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>I choose A. Cigarettes should be banned.</p><p></p><p>Assertion: It is important to prohibit cigarettes since smokers (and passive smokers especially) battle with the effects eventually. Smoking makes one vulnerable to various health problems, for example, lung diseases like chronic bronchitis. It causes most cases of lung cancer.</p><p></p><p>Reasoning: Tobacco manufacturing have a long history of promising to stop the production of cigarettes, should they ever be proven harmful. The most important reason to ban the sale of cigarettes, however, is that most smokers do not even like the fact they smoke; cigarettes are not a recreational drug.</p><p>Evidence: Apart from reducing human suffering, abolishing the sale of cigarettes would result in savings in the realm of healthcare costs, increased labour productivity, lessened harms from fires, reduced consumption of scarce physical resources, and a smaller global carbon footprint.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is My Own Opinion (You don’t have to Copy my opinion, if you want to): My Own Opinion is Cigarettes are not good and carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke reduces the amount of oxygen in your blood. This means your heart has to pump harder to supply the body with the oxygen it needs.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Sana makatulong</p><p>/</p><p>Hope it helps a lot!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student, it is important to have a balance between academic responsibilities and personal life. One way to achieve this balance is by eliminating homework on weekends. Homework is an essential part of learning, but it can be overwhelming and stressful when it is assigned during weekends. Therefore, I firmly believe that students should not have homework on weekends.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, weekends are a time for rest and relaxation. After a long week of classes, students deserve a break from the academic workload. A homework-free weekend allows students to recharge their batteries and spend time with their family and friends. Moreover, students who have hobbies or engage in extracurricular activities have the opportunity to pursue their interests without the added stress of homework.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework can be a significant source of stress and anxiety for students. When homework is assigned on weekends, students may feel like they are constantly under pressure to complete their work. This can lead to a lack of motivation, which can ultimately harm academic performance. In addition, excessive homework can also affect the physical and mental health of students, leading to fatigue and burnout.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, it is essential to remember that homework is not the only measure of a student's academic success. While it is necessary to complete homework assignments to a satisfactory standard, a student's ability to learn and retain knowledge should not be solely based on homework completion. Teachers can provide alternative methods of assessing students' understanding of the material, such as class discussions, group projects, or in-class assignments.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the weekend is a time for relaxation, family, friends, and personal interests. Therefore, I strongly believe that students should not have homework on weekends. A break from the academic workload allows students to recharge, destress, and engage in other activities that contribute to their overall well-being. By eliminating homework on weekends, students can achieve a healthy balance between academic responsibilities and personal life.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Digital technology makes children's lives better.</strong></p><p>Digital technology has had a profound impact on children's lives by providing them with access to a wealth of educational, recreational, and communication opportunities. It has enabled them to explore and discover new things, while also giving them a platform to express themselves and connect with others. From online learning resources to interactive games, digital technology has made it easier than ever for children to learn, create, and engage with the world around them. In short, digital technology has made children's lives better by providing them with the tools to stay educated and connected in a quickly changing world.</p><p></p><p><strong>Books are better than television.</strong></p><p>Books are far superior to television when it comes to providing educational and entertainment value. Not only do books offer the opportunity to engage with complex storylines and characters, but they also allow the reader to challenge their critical thinking skills and expand their knowledge base. In contrast, television simply offers passive entertainment with minimal educational or thought-provoking content. Therefore, books are undeniably the better choice for readers seeking to truly engage with the stories they consume.</p><p></p><p><strong>School uniforms should be abolished.</strong></p><p>School uniforms should be abolished because they limit students' individual expression, create an unnecessary financial burden on families, and do not influence academic performance. Requiring students to wear uniforms goes against the very core of our educational system, which is to nurture independent thought and creativity. Furthermore, the cost of the uniforms can be a significant financial burden on lower-income families, who may be forced to make difficult choices between buying uniforms and other basic necessities. Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that requiring uniforms in schools leads to any improvement in academic performance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Homework should be banned.</strong></p><p>Homework should be banned because it takes away valuable time from students to pursue their interests, practice sports, and spend time with family. Furthermore, research has shown that homework does not necessarily lead to improved academic performance, and it can cause unnecessary stress and anxiety in students. Therefore, it is in the best interest of students to eliminate homework altogether.</p><p></p><p><strong>We should all be vegetarian.</strong></p><p>We should all be vegetarian because it is a more sustainable and healthier dietary choice than eating meat. Not only does it reduce the environmental impact of animal agriculture, but it also reduces the risk of certain diseases and helps to limit the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, plant-based diets are low in saturated fat and cholesterol, making them an excellent choice for those looking to improve their overall health.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> i choose Effect on video games</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Playing video games has negative impacts on a child's education. Studies have shown that out of four children, playing video games interferes with academic performance of one child. Some children spend most of their time playing games to the extent of not sparing some time to do their homework. Violent video games are harmful because they can lead to health problems and effect learning , portray bad things and teach kids wrong doings, and can lead to serious crimes. Playing video games can lead to brain damage and effect learning.It's true that some studies have shown certain video games can improve hand–eye coordination, problem-solving skills, and the mind's ability to process information. ... And kids who play violent video games might act more aggressively. But here's the good news: Playing video games some of the time can be OK.</p><p></p><p>#CARRY ON LEARNING </p><p></p><br />

                            23. make a persuasive essay about" Should we have to do Homework? "​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In modern education, homework has been a longstanding practice that has been the subject of debate for decades. While some educators argue that homework is an essential part of a student's education, others believe that it is an unnecessary burden on students' time and mental health. In this essay, I will argue that students should not be burdened with homework.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework often results in an overwhelming amount of stress for students. When students are given a substantial amount of homework, they become anxious and overwhelmed, which can result in feelings of burnout and exhaustion. This stress not only negatively impacts their mental health but can also affect their performance in class, leading to poor academic performance and low grades.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the time spent doing homework could be better used for other important activities. After spending six to eight hours at school, students should be able to spend their free time engaging in activities they enjoy, such as sports, hobbies, or spending time with family and friends. These activities are important for a student's mental and physical health and help to promote a balanced lifestyle.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, homework can also create a significant imbalance in the time and workload between students. Some students may have the resources, support, and time to complete their homework while others may not. This imbalance creates a disadvantage for students who cannot afford to dedicate extra time and resources to their homework, thus widening the achievement gap and creating an unfair playing field.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, homework should not be a requirement in modern education. Homework often results in an overwhelming amount of stress, reduces time for other important activities, and can create an imbalance between students. Instead, educators should focus on in-class activities, group projects, and other innovative teaching strategies that promote a healthy and balanced learning environment. It is time to reconsider the value of homework and place students' mental and physical health as a top priority.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>     Teachers should give homework on weekends, possibly relevant to the environment the students are working in, reasonably within a set time limit and should have a clear schedule. It should be followed-up in the school to show that it is valued and makes a useful contribution to learning.</p><p>     Homework gives better retention of factual knowledge, increases understanding, critical thinking, concept formation and information processing and also curriculum enrichment. It encourages learning during leisure time, improves attitude towards school, develops better study habits, greater self-direction, self-discipline, better time organisation, more inquisitiveness and independent problem-solving, promoting the student-parent-teacher partnership.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the valuable reasons why homework should be banned is the fact most teachers fail to explain everything needed to solve the task during the class.
