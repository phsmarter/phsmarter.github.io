                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I jump to the conclusion that the bartender has no logical reason why did he did that</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>You see, the waiter assumed the man was asking for the cure of a hiccup for himself without getting the full picture. He drew the conclusion by slapping the inquirer, thinking he was the one that needed the hiccup cure. He did not get the full picture and so he got the wrong picture. He assumed to know and quickly concluded wrongly. Most of us are like the waiter. Several times we have slapped, judged, condemned, assumed and conclude on people without giving them any chance or opportunity. Some of us have killed and buried alive fathers, sons and people that should have been generals in the kingdom too quickly. We act too quick, assume wrongly, judge poorly and conclude on people too quickly.</p><p></p><br />

"drama is very important in life you have to come on with a bang you never want to go out with a whimper everything can have drama if it's done right even a pancake". -julia chil2. "before i write down one word i have the carter in my man through and through i must penetrate into the last twinkle of his soul". -henrik ibsen 3. "I think what makes people fascinating is conflict its drama it's human condition nobody wants to watch perfection". -nicholas cage​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>- Drama is life with the enjoyable aspects cut out. Everyone experiences peaks and troughs in life. If we're in pain, it is difficult to remain positive and calm. Life isn't always a perfectly fine. We just had to deal with a lot of stuff that we don't want to interact with. We are confronted with various situations that make us want to give up. Nevertheless, life is about fulfilling obligations. Life is about gaining knowledge from our failures and doing the proper thing. We must keep going to do our better, and our mistakes will inevitably lead us to the proper path. A life without drama is a good life. It is not an easy journey. It's a hard life full of ups and downs. We learn from our mistakes as well as our successes. In the final moment, we make progress.</p><p></p><p>-  I know characters just about as one would know them after a few weeks’ stay in a spa; I have learned the fundamental traits in their characters as well as their little peculiarities; yet it is not impossible that I might make an error in some essential matter. In the last draft, finally, I stand at the limit of knowledge; I know my people from close and long association — they are my intimate friends, who will not disappoint me in any way; in the manner in which I see them now, I shall always see them.”</p><p></p><p>Henrik Ibsen </p><p></p><p>- It means that the real individuals and actual reality aren't neatly packaged or sealed in the strands of decorum, command, aspirations, and predicted outcomes, so get prepared and be equipped for anything to happen, because anything is a reasonable chance. </p><br />
