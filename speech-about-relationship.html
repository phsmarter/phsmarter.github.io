                                            What's InIn our last module, we learned that a shift in speech context, speech style,speech act, and communicative strategy affects the way people communicate invarious aspects and we were also taught how to respond to different speakingsituations considering these changes.Now, we will learn about the principles of effective speech writing focusing onaudience analysis and logical organization. Often times, we focus so much on whatwe want to say that we often overlook the question of who our audience is. Doesyour audience care what you as a speaker think? Can they see how your speechapplies to their lives and interests? The act of public speaking is a shared activitythat involves interaction between speaker and audience. In order for your speech toget a fair hearing, you need to create a relationship with your listeners. Moreover, wewill also learn how to organize your ideas into a coherent, strategic speech.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Role of a Friend</p><p>True friends always support each other even during the hardest of times. A true friend is one who feels happy for our success, on the other hand, who feel gloomy for our failures. A true friend may criticize also so that we may come out of our weakness.</p><p></p><p>He may scold us if we do a mistake and guide the right path. That’s why it is being said that true friend is more precious than any gem in our life. Love from your friend will always be unconditional. They may expect nothing from us but shower their love always.</p><p></p><p>Friendship – A Divine Relationship</p><p>Friendship is a divine relationship, which is beyond the definition of blood relations. It is the only relation that is truly priceless. We may acquire all kinds of pleasures by putting our efforts. But even then life may remain dull, without having someone to share our life with some true friends.</p><p></p><p>It’s natural that human being always tends to find emotional support and social life. In spite of having everything in life, we may remain in a vacuum. It happens only when we have no such good friend to share our small and small happiness in life. Friends are always there to listen to us unconditionally.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good day everyone,</p><p></p><p>Today I want to talk to you about relationships. Relationships are a fundamental part of our lives, and they come in many different forms. We have relationships with our family, friends, partners, colleagues, and even with ourselves.</p><p></p><p>But what makes a good relationship? I believe that the key to a healthy and fulfilling relationship is communication. Communication involves listening, understanding, and expressing oneself in a way that is honest, respectful, and compassionate. It is about being open and receptive to the thoughts, feelings, and needs of others, and being willing to share our own thoughts, feelings, and needs.</p><p></p><p>Good communication is the foundation of a strong and healthy relationship. It allows us to build trust, connection, and intimacy with others, and to resolve conflicts and challenges in a constructive and positive way.</p><p></p><p>But communication is not the only important aspect of a good relationship. It is also important to show empathy, kindness, and support to those we care about. This might involve offering words of encouragement, lending a helping hand, or simply being there for someone when they need us.</p><p></p><p>In addition, it is also important to set boundaries and maintain our own sense of self-respect and self-worth in our relationships. This means standing up for ourselves and our values, and not sacrificing our own needs and well-being for the sake of someone else.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, relationships are an essential part of our lives, and good relationships require communication, empathy, kindness, and self-respect. By fostering these qualities in our relationships, we can build strong, healthy, and fulfilling connections with others. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I would like to talk about relationships, and the importance of them.</p><p></p><p>Relationships are an important part of our lives. They provide us with companionship, emotional support, and a sense of belonging. They can also help us develop self-confidence and emotional resilience.</p><p></p><p>We all have different kinds of relationships in our lives - family, friends, colleagues, partners. Each of these relationships has its own set of challenges and rewards. It’s important to nurture these relationships and to be open and honest with those closest to us.</p><p></p><p>When we are in healthy relationships, we are more likely to feel supported, respected and valued. We can share our feelings and experiences with those around us, and we can rely on them to be there for us when we need them.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, not all relationships are healthy. If a relationship becomes abusive, or if we feel neglected or taken for granted, it can cause us to feel isolated, anxious, or even depressed. In these cases, it is important to seek help and support, and to get out of the unhealthy situation as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of relationship we have, it’s important to remember that relationships are a two-way street. We all need to be willing to put in effort and to give and take, in order for the relationship to be successful.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, relationships are an important part of our lives, and we should always strive to keep them healthy and positive. Thank you for listening.</p><br />

                            19. What's InIn our last module, we learned that a shift in speech context, speech style,speech act, and communicative strategy affects the way people communicate invarious aspects and we were also taught how to respond to different speakingsituations considering these changes.Now, we will learn about the principles of effective speech writing focusing onaudience analysis and logical organization. Often times, we focus so much on whatwe want to say that we often overlook the question of who our audience is. Doesyour audience care what you as a speaker think? Can they see how your speechapplies to their lives and interests? The act of public speaking is a shared activitythat involves interaction between speaker and audience. In order for your speech toget a fair hearing, you need to create a relationship with your listeners. Moreover, wewill also learn how to organize your ideas into a coherent, strategic speech.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Students don’t always want to go to class. They may have required classes that they find difficult or don’t enjoy, or they may feel overwhelmed by other commitments or feel tired if they have early morning classes. However, even if instructors allow a certain number of unexcused absences, you should aim to attend every class session. Class attendance enhances class performance in the following ways:</p><p></p><p>Class participation: If you don’t attend class, you can’t participate in class activities. Class activities are usually part of your final grade, and they can help you apply concepts you learn from lectures and reading assignments.</p><p>Class interaction: If you rely on learning on your own (by doing the reading assignments outside of class, for example), you’ll miss out on class discussions with fellow students. Your classmates will often have the same questions as you, so going to class enables you to learn from them and ask your instructor about topics you all find difficult.</p><p>Interaction with the instructor: There is a reason why classes are taught by instructors. Instructors specialize in the subjects they teach, and they can provide extra insight and perspective on the material you’re studying. Going to class gives you the chance to take notes and ask questions about the lectures. Also, the more you participate, the more your instructors will come to know you and be aware of any help or support you might need. This will make you feel more comfortable to approach them outside of class if you need advice or are struggling with the course material.</p><p>Increased learning: Even though you will typically spend more time on coursework outside of the classroom, this makes class sessions even more valuable. Typically, in-class time will be devoted to the most challenging or key concepts covered in your textbooks. It’s important to know what these are so you can master them—also they’re likely to show up on exams.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Sana Po makatulong</p><p>pa brainlaist po ❤</p><br />

                        <p> </p><strong>Title: The Importance of Building Strong Relationships</strong><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to speak with you today about the importance of building strong relationships. Relationships are an essential part of our lives, both personally and professionally. They help us to connect with others, build trust, and achieve our goals. In this speech, I will discuss the benefits of building strong relationships and provide some practical tips on how to do so.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Firstly, building strong relationships can help us to achieve our goals. Whether it is in our personal or professional lives, having a strong support system can help us to overcome obstacles and achieve success. This is because when we have strong relationships, we have people who believe in us, support us, and are willing to help us when we need it. </p><p></p><p>Secondly, building strong relationships can help us to improve our communication skills. When we have strong relationships, we are more likely to communicate openly and honestly with others. This can help us to resolve conflicts, build trust, and strengthen our connections with others. </p><p></p><p>Finally, building strong relationships can help us to improve our overall well-being. Studies have shown that people who have strong relationships are happier, healthier, and more fulfilled in their lives. This is because having strong relationships can provide us with a sense of belonging, purpose, and meaning in our lives. </p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, building strong relationships is essential for our personal and professional growth. It can help us to achieve our goals, improve our communication skills, and enhance our overall well-being. I encourage you all to take the time to invest in your relationships, whether it is with your family, friends, or colleagues. Thank you for listening.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
