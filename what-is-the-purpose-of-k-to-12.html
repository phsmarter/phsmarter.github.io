                                            Should our school have a civilian attire day? by Mary Catherine Siena (An Excerpt) High school students like us, who are mostly teenagers, find many ways to express ourselves. Sometimes, we like to express ourselves through art like those cool drawings and paintings we find in our Visual Arts classroom or the small doodles we draw in our notebooks. However, one of the simplest ways we express ourselves is through the clothes that we wear. Hence, I believe that we should have a day for civilian attire. Source: Language in Literature K to 12 (2020) Questions: 1. Based on the text, what are some ways people express themselves? 2. Are these ways similar to or different from the way you express yourself? If so, in what ways are they the same or different? 3. What is the purpose of the author in writing the essay? 4. Do you agree or disagree with the author's stance? Explain.​</a>

The qualitative research design that can be used to study the lives of the Aboriginal people in Australia is ethnography. Ethnography is a method of research that involves observing and interacting with a specific group of people to understand their culture, beliefs, and behaviors.</p><p>2. The qualitative research design that can be used to describe the implementation of K-12 among kindergarten pupils in Brgy. Pembo, Makati City is case study. A case study is an in-depth analysis of a specific case or situation to understand its complexities and unique characteristics.</p><p>3. The research topic "Most Profitable Recipe: The Best Wintermelon Milk Tea Recipes from 200 Local Milk Tea Shop" is not an appropriate research topic for qualitative research because it is more suited for quantitative research. Quantitative research involves collecting numerical data to analyze and draw conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Activity #2</p><p>1. The statement "Purposive sampling chooses its sample based on the idea of using referrals" is incorrect. Purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling technique that involves selecting participants based on a specific purpose or criteria relevant to the research study, rather than relying on chance or randomness. Referral sampling, on the other hand, involves participants being referred to the researcher by other participants.</p><p>2. The statement "A non-probability sampling technique, by other respondents to locate other members of the population" is not a complete statement and is unclear. It is difficult to determine which sampling technique is being referred to without additional context.</p><br />

                            29. Should our school have a civilian attire day? by Mary Catherine Siena (An Excerpt) High school students like us, who are mostly teenagers, find many ways to express ourselves. Sometimes, we like to express ourselves through art like those cool drawings and paintings we find in our Visual Arts classroom or the small doodles we draw in our notebooks. However, one of the simplest ways we express ourselves is through the clothes that we wear. Hence, I believe that we should have a day for civilian attire. Source: Language in Literature K to 12 (2020) Questions: 1. Based on the text, what are some ways people express themselves? 2. Are these ways similar to or different from the way you express yourself? If so, in what ways are they the same or different? 3. What is the purpose of the author in writing the essay? 4. Do you agree or disagree with the author's stance? Explain.​</h2><br />
