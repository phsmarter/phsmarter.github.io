1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                            7. (Essay)what is the importance of marriage? How do you see yourself 10years from now?​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>When it comes to family life, I would like to get married by the age of 29 but choose to avoid it before the age of 26. It is a time to strengthen career, have fun and understanding life better before you add important extensions to the responsibilities. Family life indispensably includes parents and folks. So, I earnestly wish my relationship with my family to be hale and hearty. In case, I get married, I wish to be a very supportive and loving spouse.</p><p></p><p>In 10 years, I see myself healthier and more sensible than today. A good lifestyle, distance from unhealthy habits and hence, a stronger mind and body to live in or with is significant. How can I be a support to my family or myself in any respect if I choose to be careless about my well-being? So, a healthier mind and body are definite to happen.</p><p></p><p>The last but never the least, I aspire to be a better human being within next 10 years. I wish my will power strengthens and so does my wisdom. I will be able to distinguish between right and wrong after 10 years, whose endeavour begins from here, the present. A better understanding of life, a tendency to resolve matters with and for peace, a clear conscience and fair decisive power- I will attain these abilities within next 10 years.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I see myself after 10 years as a dedicated professional, loving and caring member of family and a better human being. A person who can be sought for advice, help and suggestions, who is a good citizen and values simple things of happiness in life- these must be my qualities by the end of next decade. And it is important to know that these visions can come true only if the venture begins today.</p><p></p><p></p>IMPORTANCE OF MARRIAGE<p>What is <strong>marriage</strong>? Is it really important?</p><p>They say <strong>marriage </strong>binds two souls in one but do we really need marriage in this lifetime? I know I have a lot of questions in my mind and feels like no one can answer them but myself. In this generation, many couples live under one roof already even without the sanctity of <strong>marriage</strong>. Statistics also proved that many married couples still ended up with divorce. So, let me ask you again, does marriage really important? What if today you got married and then the next morning you fell out of love with your husband or your wife? I know it's complicated but life should be simple right? So, why make it complicated by just getting married. I am not telling you to stop getting married, if that's your dream then go for it. My point here is <strong>marriage </strong>is sometimes unnecessary and just leaves you with trauma and disgust. If you love someone, then spend the rest of your life loving them but do not get married for it will just ruin the love that you most cherish. I wonder if ten years from now, my perspective in marriage will still be like this? I even wonder if I a married by that time. However, one thing is for sure, <strong>marriage </strong>will never be my thing.</p><p></p><p>Importance of Marriage: brainly.ph/question/8967985</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><p></p><br />

I want to raise people's knowledge of the advantages of being a vegetarian because I am one. Being a vegetarian these days is harder than it used to be because of distractions like peer pressure.

                            18. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />
