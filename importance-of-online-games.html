We also discussed limitations and implications for mental health practice<br />

                        <p><strong>1. Climate is an significant topic even in the  face of economic crises, conflicts and constant social problems.  This matters because Earth is human beings' only  habitat, and it provides air, food and other necessities. The whole life support system of mankind relies  on the well-being of all the animals on earth.  This is commonly called the biosphere, a  term coined by 1920s Russian scientist Vladimir Vernadsky.  Biosphere refers to one global ecological  environment that interdepends on all living things.  There are smaller ecosystems within the overall biosphere or  ecosystem, such as the rainforests, oceans, desert, and tundra.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Playing online games can be both beneficial and harmful at the same time. Playing video games can improve one's patience and teaches someone how to be gumptious when trying to complete a certain task in a game. On the harmful side, online games can be addictive. Irregular sleeping patterns, skipping meals and isolation from the real world are just some of the negative effects of game addiction.</strong></p>Hope this will help you po<br />
