                                            The current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the significant variations in coronavirus control and containment techniques throughout the world, as well as the variable efficacy of such efforts in reducing corona virus transmission. While earlier research has demonstrated that combining air travel data and governmental policy responses in global disease transmission modeling has a high predictive value, variables affecting the choice to enact travel and border restriction policies are not well understood. In this regard, travel-related policies would have an influence on globalization. If a country continues to permit tourists to travel or visit their country, the public health would most likely suffer as a result of the existing scenario. On the other side, if we refuse to admit tourists, the economy of a certain country would suffer. In your opinion, should a country begin to allow visitors in order to restore the economy's life, or should it prioritize public health first?​pahelp po</a>

                                            Summarize and report the articleETO PO KARUGTONGTwo faces of changeAs many have said, Covid-19 will usher in a new normal. And as we are experiencing now, change can be difficult, especially if it happens abruptly. But change also has a positive side. In a famous speech by the late US President John F. Kennedy, the word “crisis” is composed of two characters in Chinese. One means danger, the other opportunity. Like other Kennedy sound bites that were either expressed in a foreign language or referenced one, their accuracy has been questioned. But the point is not to despair, not even in trying times.Even today, opportunities are emerging. For instance, the greater acceptance of people working from home may contribute to a better quality of life for those who are allowed to practice it. The new arrangement will even help ease traffic congestion, which costs the Philippine economy P3.5 billion a day based on a Japanese study.The pandemic may even hasten the development of the digital economy, even in emerging economies like the Philippines. Perhaps with more people working from home, there will be greater public pressure for the government to accelerate the introduction of the third telco player and faster development of the country’s digital infrastructure. And with quality internet connectivity, perhaps the government will be successful in decongesting urban centers because people will be able to work from anywhere in the country.True, times will remain tough in the days and months ahead. But it is accurate to note that resilience is one of the best attributes of Filipinos. For now, drawing on our reserves of hope can tide us over until better days.​</a>

                                            Title: Real-Life Application of Quadratic Functions Objective: To appreciate the real-life application of quadratic Functions You are recently promoted as the chief traffic management officer of a major city in the country. Based on recent data, you learned that one of the leading causes of road accidents is over speeding. In your desire to minimize road accidents, you went out to observe how traffic management rules are implemented on the streets. Your attention was caught by a fast - moving car that seemed to be breaking the speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour(km/hr.), and so you followed it along the highway. After a short time, the driver of the car noticed you and started to slow down. Eventually, he stopped on the side of the road. Supposed the speed of the car had been noted during this time and is modeled by the quadratic equation y = 3x² + 17x - 20, where y represents the speed of the car in km/hr. and x represents the number of minutes after you started following the car. How long did it take for the car to be under surveillance before it could finally stop on the side of the road? Did the driver of the car really break the speed limit of 100 km/hr.? Explain. The result of your observation will be presented to the students in your section and will be graded by your teacher. You will prepare an observation report highlighting whether it is necessary to come up with a more stringent implementation of traffic rules based on the outcome of your analysis of the problem that you encountered on the road.​</a>

                            10. The current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the significant variations in coronavirus control and containment techniques throughout the world, as well as the variable efficacy of such efforts in reducing corona virus transmission. While earlier research has demonstrated that combining air travel data and governmental policy responses in global disease transmission modeling has a high predictive value, variables affecting the choice to enact travel and border restriction policies are not well understood. In this regard, travel-related policies would have an influence on globalization. If a country continues to permit tourists to travel or visit their country, the public health would most likely suffer as a result of the existing scenario. On the other side, if we refuse to admit tourists, the economy of a certain country would suffer. In your opinion, should a country begin to allow visitors in order to restore the economy's life, or should it prioritize public health first?​pahelp po</h2><br />

                            18. Summarize and report the articleETO PO KARUGTONGTwo faces of changeAs many have said, Covid-19 will usher in a new normal. And as we are experiencing now, change can be difficult, especially if it happens abruptly. But change also has a positive side. In a famous speech by the late US President John F. Kennedy, the word “crisis” is composed of two characters in Chinese. One means danger, the other opportunity. Like other Kennedy sound bites that were either expressed in a foreign language or referenced one, their accuracy has been questioned. But the point is not to despair, not even in trying times.Even today, opportunities are emerging. For instance, the greater acceptance of people working from home may contribute to a better quality of life for those who are allowed to practice it. The new arrangement will even help ease traffic congestion, which costs the Philippine economy P3.5 billion a day based on a Japanese study.The pandemic may even hasten the development of the digital economy, even in emerging economies like the Philippines. Perhaps with more people working from home, there will be greater public pressure for the government to accelerate the introduction of the third telco player and faster development of the country’s digital infrastructure. And with quality internet connectivity, perhaps the government will be successful in decongesting urban centers because people will be able to work from anywhere in the country.True, times will remain tough in the days and months ahead. But it is accurate to note that resilience is one of the best attributes of Filipinos. For now, drawing on our reserves of hope can tide us over until better days.​</h2><br />

                            21. Title: Real-Life Application of Quadratic Functions Objective: To appreciate the real-life application of quadratic Functions You are recently promoted as the chief traffic management officer of a major city in the country. Based on recent data, you learned that one of the leading causes of road accidents is over speeding. In your desire to minimize road accidents, you went out to observe how traffic management rules are implemented on the streets. Your attention was caught by a fast - moving car that seemed to be breaking the speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour(km/hr.), and so you followed it along the highway. After a short time, the driver of the car noticed you and started to slow down. Eventually, he stopped on the side of the road. Supposed the speed of the car had been noted during this time and is modeled by the quadratic equation y = 3x² + 17x - 20, where y represents the speed of the car in km/hr. and x represents the number of minutes after you started following the car. How long did it take for the car to be under surveillance before it could finally stop on the side of the road? Did the driver of the car really break the speed limit of 100 km/hr.? Explain. The result of your observation will be presented to the students in your section and will be graded by your teacher. You will prepare an observation report highlighting whether it is necessary to come up with a more stringent implementation of traffic rules based on the outcome of your analysis of the problem that you encountered on the road.​</h2><br />
