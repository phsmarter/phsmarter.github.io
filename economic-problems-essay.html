                            1. Essay to Economic Problem​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The economic problem refers to the fundamental issue of scarcity and how to allocate limited resources to satisfy unlimited wants and needs. It is a pervasive issue that affects all societies, regardless of their level of development or economic system.</p><p></p><p>At its core, the economic problem is about how to make choices. We live in a world of finite resources, but our desires and wants are unlimited. We want more goods and services than we can possibly produce, and we must choose which of these desires to pursue with the resources we have available. This necessitates trade-offs, as we must sacrifice some desires to satisfy others.</p><p></p><p>The concept of opportunity cost is central to the economic problem. Opportunity cost refers to the cost of the next best alternative that must be forgone in order to pursue a certain action. In other words, it is the value of the next best thing you could have done if you had not chosen to do what you actually did.</p><p></p><p>Opportunity cost is important because it forces us to consider the trade-offs involved in every decision we make. For example, if you choose to spend your money on a new car, the opportunity cost is the other things you could have spent that money on, such as a vacation, a down payment on a house, or saving for retirement. When resources are scarce, we must be mindful of the opportunity cost of our choices to ensure we are making the best use of them.</p><p></p><p>Another important concept related to the economic problem is efficiency. Efficiency refers to the ability to produce the maximum amount of output with the given resources. When resources are used efficiently, there is no waste or excess, and the economy is able to produce as much as possible. Efficiency is important because it allows us to produce more goods and services, which can help to satisfy more wants and needs.</p><p></p><p>The economic problem is not a new one, and economists have developed various theories and models to help understand it. One of the most prominent is the theory of supply and demand. According to this theory, the price of a good or service is determined by the interaction of supply and demand. When there is a high demand for a good or service but a limited supply, the price will rise until the demand is satisfied. Conversely, when there is a surplus of a good or service, the price will fall until the excess is consumed.</p><p></p><p>Another economic model that addresses the economic problem is the production possibility frontier (PPF). The PPF is a graph that shows the maximum amount of two goods that can be produced with a given set of resources. It illustrates the concept of opportunity cost by demonstrating the trade-offs involved in producing one good versus another. The PPF can be used to analyze the efficiency of an economy, as well as the effects of changes in resources or technology.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the economic problem is a fundamental issue that all societies must grapple with. It involves the trade-offs and choices that must be made when resources are limited but wants and needs are infinite. Understanding concepts such as opportunity cost and efficiency, as well as economic models like supply and demand and the production possibility frontier, can help us to better analyze and address the economic problem.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here is a 318 word essay on the issue of increasing economic inequality in society with references cited in APA style:</p><p></p><p>In many nations, the gap between the rich and the poor has been increasing over the past few decades. Economic inequality refers to the unequal distribution of income and wealth in a society. The issues of growing inequality are important to address as they can lead to negative consequences such as social unrest and poorer health outcomes.</p><p></p><p>A major cause of rising inequality is globalization. Globalization has led to job outsourcing and decline of middle-income jobs which used to provide stable incomes for many people (Klein, 2007). At the same time, globalization has enabled the rich to gain more wealth by expanding their businesses internationally and taking advantage of cheaper foreign labor markets and tax havens (Klein, 2007). These trends have disproportionately benefited higher-income groups while reducing opportunities for middle and lower-income groups, thus widening the gap between the rich and the poor.  </p><p></p><p>Governments should implement policies to redistribute wealth and promote equality of opportunity. Providing free or subsidized access to high-quality education and job training programs can help equip people with skills needed for higher-paying jobs (Stiglitz, 2012). Raising the minimum wage and expanding social protections such as universal basic income, unemployment benefits and public pensions can help support the poor and middle class (Stiglitz, 2013). Increasing taxes on the affluent, taxing wealth and property, and reducing tax loopholes utilized by the rich to hide money in offshore accounts can generate funds for government programs promoting greater equality (Piketty, 2014).</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, economic inequality is a significant problem which governments need to remedy to create a just and sustainable society. By investing in social welfare, education and fair tax systems, countries can help reduce the gap between the rich and the poor and cultivate a prosperous middle class, which is essential for society's long term political and economic stability.  </p><p></p><p>References: </p><p>Klein, N.

Scarcity implies there is only a limited quantity of resources, e.g. finite fossil fuels. Because of scarcity, there is a constant opportunity cost – if you use resources to consume one good, you cannot consume another. Therefore, an underlying feature of economics is concerned with dealing how to allocate resources in society to make the most efficient and fair use of resources</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Global poverty is one of the most persistent and largest community problems the world is currently facing. To this day, 736.6 million people still live in extreme poverty with $1.90 or less than per day as their only source of income (World Bank, 2019). This can affect communities globally and locally in various ways, such as increased health problems due to a lack of access to health care and healthy food, increased crime rates resulting from desperate attempts to survive, barriers to education, and a decrease in the quality of life. </p><p></p><p>The underlying causes of poverty are complex and vary from region to region but are often attributed to unequal distribution of wealth and resources, lack of access to quality education and healthcare, discrimination, ineffective political and economic systems, insecure property rights, and limited access to capital and financial services (Yom-Tov &amp; Sabar, 2019). These causes only further bring about more disparities between communities, creating even larger rifts. </p><p></p><p>The effects of poverty on communities can be catastrophic as individuals and families struggle to survive, often sacrificing individual health and wellbeing. The lack of economic and social security further enslave communities in poverty, as basic necessities and services are cut off to families. In developing countries specifically, poverty has long-term and lasting effects, as the lack of access to education, healthcare, and housing limits their chances of financial stability, further limiting the chances of children to escape poverty as well.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is an issue that needs to be tackled through a unified effort on global, regional, and individual levels. The implementation of better policies and systems, fair distribution of wealth, security of property rights, and improved access to capital and financial services can help reduce poverty, create hope for developing countries, and foster growth in communities. Through improved access to public health, education, and financial services, the effects of poverty on individual communities can be minimized and a sense of stability and much-needed security can be restored. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, global poverty is one of the most daunting global problems that continues to affect the world. However, with improved policies and programs and access to basic necessities, services and resources, communities can be transformed, creating conditions that foster economic and social stability.</p><p></p><p>References</p><p></p><p>Yom-Tov, Y., &amp; Sabar, S.

                            29. Write an essay about the effect of global pandemic to the fundamental economic problem that our country is continuously facing and how this affect the economic goals of our country?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlest pagtama</p><br />
