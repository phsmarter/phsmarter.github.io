                            4. make a persuasive essay about" Should we have to do Homework? "​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In modern education, homework has been a longstanding practice that has been the subject of debate for decades. While some educators argue that homework is an essential part of a student's education, others believe that it is an unnecessary burden on students' time and mental health. In this essay, I will argue that students should not be burdened with homework.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework often results in an overwhelming amount of stress for students. When students are given a substantial amount of homework, they become anxious and overwhelmed, which can result in feelings of burnout and exhaustion. This stress not only negatively impacts their mental health but can also affect their performance in class, leading to poor academic performance and low grades.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the time spent doing homework could be better used for other important activities. After spending six to eight hours at school, students should be able to spend their free time engaging in activities they enjoy, such as sports, hobbies, or spending time with family and friends. These activities are important for a student's mental and physical health and help to promote a balanced lifestyle.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, homework can also create a significant imbalance in the time and workload between students. Some students may have the resources, support, and time to complete their homework while others may not. This imbalance creates a disadvantage for students who cannot afford to dedicate extra time and resources to their homework, thus widening the achievement gap and creating an unfair playing field.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, homework should not be a requirement in modern education. Homework often results in an overwhelming amount of stress, reduces time for other important activities, and can create an imbalance between students. Instead, educators should focus on in-class activities, group projects, and other innovative teaching strategies that promote a healthy and balanced learning environment. It is time to reconsider the value of homework and place students' mental and physical health as a top priority.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="write-a-persuasive-essay-about-no-homework-on-weekends-need-answers-plssss-%e2%80%8b">
                            5. Write a persuasive essay about "NO HOMEWORK" on weekends.Need answers plssss.. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student, it is important to have a balance between academic responsibilities and personal life. One way to achieve this balance is by eliminating homework on weekends. Homework is an essential part of learning, but it can be overwhelming and stressful when it is assigned during weekends. Therefore, I firmly believe that students should not have homework on weekends.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, weekends are a time for rest and relaxation. After a long week of classes, students deserve a break from the academic workload. A homework-free weekend allows students to recharge their batteries and spend time with their family and friends. Moreover, students who have hobbies or engage in extracurricular activities have the opportunity to pursue their interests without the added stress of homework.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework can be a significant source of stress and anxiety for students. When homework is assigned on weekends, students may feel like they are constantly under pressure to complete their work. This can lead to a lack of motivation, which can ultimately harm academic performance. In addition, excessive homework can also affect the physical and mental health of students, leading to fatigue and burnout.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, it is essential to remember that homework is not the only measure of a student's academic success. While it is necessary to complete homework assignments to a satisfactory standard, a student's ability to learn and retain knowledge should not be solely based on homework completion. Teachers can provide alternative methods of assessing students' understanding of the material, such as class discussions, group projects, or in-class assignments.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the weekend is a time for relaxation, family, friends, and personal interests. Therefore, I strongly believe that students should not have homework on weekends. A break from the academic workload allows students to recharge, destress, and engage in other activities that contribute to their overall well-being. By eliminating homework on weekends, students can achieve a healthy balance between academic responsibilities and personal life.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Homework is defined as an out of class task assigned to students to help them practice and prepare for their future. Homework has been around for a very long time. It is set and traced as a tradition of having teachers assigning work and students completing it. Parents say that teachers require it and teachers say that parents demand more of it. Teachers assign homework to help some students improve their grade and pass the course for those of who do not do well on tests or standardized examinations. Can homework be considered helpful or harmful to students? This controversy turns into arguments and disagreements. For me, homework totally can help students in study because there are many benefits we can get from doing homework. Everyone has their own opinion right? I have my own opinion too about this topic because I think it is better if I say homework is helpful to students. Why? There are my own reasons why I support this topic.</p><br />

                        No Assignment Policy Essay<br />No homework essay introduction<br />Just imagine it’s a Sunday night. You’re all comfortable and tired, and just trying to relax because you had a great weekend. You’re just about to fall asleep, but then you realize, you have homework. Now you either get up and do all your homework, or you just leave it and take the zero. I know everybody in this room can relate to this situation because it’s happened to every single one of us before. That is why I’m talking to you about having a no homework policy in schools.<br />No homework policy: pros and cons<br />I’ll bet any amount of money that when any of you even hear the word homework, you don’t get happy or excited about it. So, if nobody like it, then why do we still have it? There are many more cons about homework then there are pros. The few pros are that some people believe that homework builds character and teaches good study habits. (Kohn 1) These “pros” are just myths that have been passed down, it has never really been proven that homework really does build character and teaches good study habits.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p> <strong>•</strong><strong>Homework is a vehicle for independent learning</strong></p><p></p><p> I feel that students should be given homework as it gives an opportunity to establish the practice of studying in the environment at home. It is a vehicle for independent learning. The reasons for giving homework change as the students get older. In the initial academic years, it is the forging of a constructive relationship between school and home that is of primordial importance. For primary school children, it gives chance to do things at home which are difficult at school. It helps parents to know what their children are doing in school.</p><p></p><p>For secondary school children, homework is important because it develops skills, confidence and motivation needed to study effectively on their own. It teaches life-long learning and adaptability, sustaining the involvement of parents in the management of students’ learning. Teachers should give homework, possibly relevant to the environment the students are working in, reasonably within a set time limit and should have a clear schedule. It should be followed-up in the school to show that it is valued and makes a useful contribution to learning.</p><p></p><p>Parents should value, encourage, praise and provide a peaceful and suitable place at home for children to do their homework. Homework gives better retention of factual knowledge, increases understanding, critical thinking, concept formation and information processing and also curriculum enrichment. It encourages learning during leisure time, improves attitude towards school, develops better study habits, greater self-direction, self-discipline, better time organisation, more inquisitiveness and independent problem-solving, promoting the student-parent-teacher partnership.</p><p></p><p>https://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Hans/2014-02-06/Essay-writing-contest-Should-students-be-given-homework-an</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research has shown that homework can improve the achievement of students in terms of exam results, grades, and the likelihood of attending college. Studies have also indicated that students who spend time each day on their homework scored better on exams compared to students who didn't do homework. One can develop a better memory and incorporate new skills with repetition. Homework is based on classwork and focuses on integrating the new skill through its practice. This helps in boosting memory and retaining the acquired knowledge for exams and future tests. Homework can provide an increased understanding of concepts taught at school. Giving students extra practice, allows those concepts to be committed to each student's long term memory. Good homework reinforces what is taught at school.</p><p></p>Homework has been a controversial topic for many years, and the question of whether it actually helps students learn is one that is still debated today. While some argue that homework is an essential part of the learning process, I believe that it is not an effective tool for helping students learn. In fact, homework can often be a waste of time for students who have responsibilities beyond their homes, and it can even lead to cheating and academic dishonesty.<br /><br />One of the main arguments against homework is that it can be copied or found online. With the internet at our fingertips, students can easily search for answers to homework questions and copy them without actually learning anything. This can lead to a false sense of understanding and can even be detrimental to a student's learning in the long run. Additionally, students who copy homework may not actually understand the material and may struggle with future assignments or tests.<br /><br />Furthermore, homework can be a waste of time for students who have responsibilities beyond their homes. Many students have part-time jobs, extracurricular activities, or family obligations that take up much of their time outside of school. For these students, spending hours on homework each night can be a burden and can even detract from their ability to focus on other important tasks. This can lead to stress and burnout, which can ultimately harm a student's academic performance and well-being.<br /><br />In conclusion, I do not support the argument that homework helps students learn. While it may be a useful tool for some students, it can also lead to cheating and academic dishonesty, and it can be a waste of time for those with responsibilities beyond their homes. Instead of relying on homework as the sole means of learning, schools should focus on creating engaging and interactive classrooms that allow students to learn in a variety of ways. By doing so, we can help all students succeed and reach their full potential.<br />

                        Living One's Life<br /><br /><br />" "Living" is easier said than done", that statement itself would make us conclude many things in life. Life isnt always easy nor is it very hard. We ask so many questions yet did you found the answer? It doesnt really matter anyway since we dont really need answers to our questions. The experiences, great or worst, painful things and all the things we've done to our life is the answer itself. The choices weve made, led us to different paths with different people. We shouldnt expect the best choice to be the best experience we will have, tho. Because even the best choices can lead us to painful experiences yet it will transformed us to become a better person. There's no harm in trying nor enduring. <br /><br />"I give up.", is a phrase commonly said by people. I,myself have said that too, in fact, I said it many times. But in those times, I always find myself into thinking through a lot of things until I find answer. Not the right one but the best option I could choose from.There's no need for you to hold back in those times. When you feel like crying, then cry. When you feel pain, then let it all out. Don't be afraid of people judging on what you've been feeling. Even if life has ups and downs, U-turns and even dead ends, don't ever give up and lose hope. <br /><br />Painful and bitter experiences in the past, can lead to a fruitful and beautiful experience in the future. So take risk and enjoy life. Have fun yet put it to limit in times. Put on a smile yet make it real. Let life give you thousands and even millions of experiences throughout! Rather than saying it's a bore and you dont care about it, eventually someday you will and you will regret the past years you've not spend it. Dream big and aim high. Don't let others' words discourage you into fulfilling whatever it is that you want. It's your dream, not their business. Above everything you do, let God be the center of your life. Always remember that He's always with us, and the sole reason for us to be still living right now.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Online learning becomes more common and more and more resources are converted to digital form, some people have suggested that public libraries should be shut down and, in their place, everyone should be given an iPad with an e-reader subscription.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>Proponents of this idea state that it will save local cities and towns money because libraries are expensive to maintain. They also believe it will encourage more people to read because they won’t have to travel to a library to get a book; they can simply click on what they want to read and read it from wherever they are. They could also access more materials because libraries won’t have to buy physical copies of books; they can simply rent out as many digital copies as they need.</p><p></p><p>However, it would be a serious mistake to replace libraries with tablets. First, digital books and resources are associated with less learning and more problems than print resources. A study done on tablet vs book reading found that people read 20-30% slower on tablets, retain 20% less information, and understand 10% less of what they read compared to people who read the same information in print.</p><p></p><p>Second, it is incredibly narrow-minded to assume that the only service libraries offer is book lending. Libraries have a multitude of benefits, and many are only available if the library has a physical location. Some of these benefits include acting as a quiet study space, giving people a way to converse with their neighbors, holding classes on a variety of topics, providing jobs, answering patron questions, and keeping the community connected. One neighborhood found that, after a local library instituted community events such as </p><p></p><p>While replacing libraries with tablets may seem like a simple solution, it would encourage people to spend even more time looking at digital screens, despite the myriad issues surrounding them. It would also end access to many of the benefits of libraries that people have come to rely on. In many areas, libraries are such an important part of the community network that they could never be replaced by a simple object.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Explanation: hope it help.</p><p>BRAINLIEST  PO PLEASE</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Yes it will help the students because they will learn more from </strong><strong>it. </strong></p><p><strong>Hope </strong><strong>It's </strong><strong>Help</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Homework is a topic that has been heavily debated for decades. Some argue that it is necessary for students to succeed, while others believe it is an unnecessary burden. In this essay, we will explore two reasons why homework is not necessary.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework can be harmful to a student's mental health. With the increasing amount of homework being assigned, students are being put under immense pressure to perform. This can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression. Students should be able to enjoy their free time after school and pursue other interests, such as sports or hobbies, which can benefit their mental and emotional well-being.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework may not always be an effective way of learning. Some students may struggle to complete homework tasks independently and may not have access to resources that can help them. This can lead to frustration and a lack of understanding of the material. Classroom instruction and discussion can be more beneficial for some students as it provides an opportunity to ask questions and receive immediate feedback.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, homework is not always necessary and can have negative effects on a student's mental health and learning. Schools should consider alternative methods of learning and assessment to provide a more well-rounded education for students.</p><br />

These are collection of statements from both sides of the arguements. Group your data into "who said it?", like the goverment (DepEd, Congressmen, or other politicians) , teachers or educators,  the students, and the parents. Then divide it into pro-homework and anti-homework. </p><p>News articles in the internet have recorded opinitions of DepEd and of local politicians. For teachers and students, you can interview your teachers and fellow students.</p><p></p><p>2. React - Validate which statement makes sense to you as a student. Then, group it into supportive arguments, these are statements you will add supportive response to; and against arguments, these are statements you will provide defensive statements againts.</p><p>Example:Homework help students demonstrate freely their deeper undestanding of the lesson by allowing them to apply the lesson to the questions provided in their own pace.</p><p>Your response: I agree with this because you remove the pressure of fellow students expecting you to know the answer right away</p><p></p><p>3. Write - With sufficient data and analysis, you will be able to present an informed and an intelligent argumentative essay. Remember to keep sentences short but clear. And it must be orderly, so the reader can understand the sequence of your statements, like knowing which argument support which statement.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong>:</p><p>As students, we are accustomed to receiving homework as part of our academic life. However, the debate over the effectiveness of homework has been ongoing for years, with some advocating for the abolishment of homework altogether. While the idea of no homework policy may sound attractive to students, it is not a feasible solution to improve the educational system. In fact, homework is an essential component of learning, and it helps students develop crucial skills that they will need in the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>Argument 1: Homework Helps Students Learn and Retain Information</strong></p><p></p><p>One of the primary reasons why homework is essential is that it reinforces what students have learned in the classroom. By completing homework assignments, students are more likely to remember the information they have learned and retain it for a more extended period. Moreover, homework provides an opportunity for students to apply what they have learned in the classroom to real-life situations. This helps them develop a better understanding of the subject matter, and it enables them to see the practical applications of the knowledge they have gained.</p><p></p><p><strong>Argument 2: Homework Develops Key Skills</strong></p><p></p><p>Homework also helps students develop key skills that are essential for success in both their academic and personal lives. By completing homework assignments, students learn how to manage their time effectively, prioritize tasks, and meet deadlines. These are skills that will serve them well in college and beyond, as well as in their careers. Additionally, homework encourages students to think critically and independently, as they must solve problems on their own without the help of a teacher.</p><p></p><p><strong>Argument 3: Homework Prepares Students for the Future</strong></p><p></p><p>Homework is not just about learning subject matter; it is also about preparing students for the future. In college and the workforce, students will be required to complete assignments independently and manage their time effectively. Homework is an excellent way to develop these skills, and it provides students with a taste of what they can expect in the future. Additionally, homework teaches students responsibility and accountability, as they are expected to complete assignments on time and to the best of their abilities.</p><p></p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p></p><p>While it may be tempting to do away with homework altogether, this is not a practical or effective solution. Homework is a critical component of learning, and it provides numerous benefits to students. It reinforces classroom learning, helps students develop key skills, and prepares them for the future. Rather than abolishing homework, we should focus on improving the quality of homework assignments and finding ways to make them more engaging and relevant to students' lives. Homework should be seen as an opportunity for students to continue their learning outside of the classroom, and as a way to develop essential skills that will serve them well in the future</p><br />

                        No Homework Policy<p>The claim that <strong>no-homework policies</strong> do not improve academic performance is the one made most frequently in favor of them.

I found it difficult to do all of my <strong>homework</strong> and paperwork during my senior year.

Even on the weekends, we are unable to socialize with our friends, classmates, and family due to our schoolwork. We have no choice but to complete our schoolwork over the weekends, so we do it at home. Our mentality is one of survival, even if we don't even love it.</p><p></p><p>Not all of us are wealthy, and many of us have shaky financial situations. The money our parents worked really hard to earn is what we utilize every day. We stick to a budget and only make purchases that are actually necessary. However, we have some schoolwork that involves printing and searching, so we must lower our allowance rather than buy food. We won't have as much money for our daily expenses as a result of those <strong>homework</strong> tasks.</p><p></p><p>Many of us have spent the entire day under intense emotional tension. We plan how to complete our coursework before tomorrow over the weekends, which is a time when we ought to be unwinding and revitalizing. Because of our assignments, we have all experienced insomniac nights and are unable to even eat on time.<strong> </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about related topic by visiting the link below:</strong></p><p>brainly.ph/question/2359808</p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />
