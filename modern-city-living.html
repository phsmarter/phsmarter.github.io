                                            Differences Between Tokyo and Kyoto
In recent decades, the title of one of the most popular cultures worldwide should be definitely given to Japan. Millions of people all over the world study the Japanese language, watch dorama (dramatic TV series on all kinds of topics) or animation, read and write haiku, and make pen pals with Japanese people. Countless people buy tickets and fly to the country of the rising sun to see its wonders with their own eyes.
Among the most popular destinations—mostly because these city names are most known to the western public—are Tokyo and Kyoto. And perhaps for an inexperienced traveler, there is a dilemma: where to go? Mostly, people know that Tokyo is a mega city of the future, and Kyoto has more to do with ancient culture, traditions, and so on. Basically it is true, but at the same time, there also exist more subtle differences one should consider when choosing their destination point in Japan.
The first of them is prices. Tokyo is expensive—as you might expect from the capital of the most urbanized country in the world (the prices below are listed in Japanese yen: 1 USD approximately equals 100 yen). So, to grab some inexpensive snack in Tokyo would cost around 850 yen. Having a three-course meal for two people in a mid-range restaurant, in case you travel with your spouse, will cost you 5,230 yen. A one-way ticket on Tokyo transport costs you 190 yen, and renting one room apartment outside of the city center costs 77,853 yen (and this is probably a weekly price). Just do not expect this apartment to be big and cozy; most likely it will be tiny, with basic utilities, and with no central heating (actually, there is no such thing in Japan at all—everyone warms their house up on their own). If you think of buying an apartment in Tokyo, forget it—one square meter of a room outside of the city center is around 1 million yen (double the price if you want to live closer to the city center).
Kyoto is not much cheaper. Although dining in a restaurant is cheaper—only 4,000 yen for two persons in a mid-range restaurant—transportation costs are surprisingly higher: 235 yen for a ride (however, if you want to purchase a monthly pass, it is cheaper to do in Kyoto rather than in Tokyo: 8,410 yen compared to 10,000 yen). If you think you can save some money buying food in a market, you are correct only in particulars: some products in Japan cost a lot of money no matter where you buy them. For example, white rice costs 850 yen for 1 kg in Kyoto (453 yen in Tokyo). White bread, tomatoes, chicken breasts, and especially cheese—these are the most expensive products both in Kyoto and in Tokyo. Speaking of accommodation, renting or buying an apartment in Kyoto is much cheaper: for a one room apartment outside of Kyoto’s center, you must pay 48,000 yen to rent, or 300,000 yen per square meter if you want to buy it (Numbeo.com).
Tokyo is great to visit if you enjoy hustle and bustle, if you want to feel the heartbeat of a mega-city, dive into its life, and experience all those crazy things people in the West usually tell about Japan. Be prepared for the overcrowded subway— and “overcrowded” is a gentle way to put it; in fact, you can take a 60-minute ride in the subway, and your feet will not even touch the floor, because you will be squeezed between other people so tight that you can even take a nap in this position. Kyoto, on the other hand, is good to visit for all those who feel inspired by traditional Japanese culture: haiku, hanami, court customs, the No theater, and so on. In Kyoto, you will not see amazing skyscrapers, over 280 subway stations, and the craziness of the famous Shibuya crossing; instead, get prepared for temples, tea houses, museums: all things antique and authentic. But, if you want modernity, go to Tokyo, and you will not feel disappointed—this city already lives in the future (Go Overseas).
It is difficult to say which city is better for an inexperienced tourist to visit, Tokyo or Kyoto. Kyoto is cheaper, especially in terms of renting an apartment, and is more suitable for those looking for the old Japanese culture weaved into sophisticated palaces made during Heian-jidai. Tokyo, on the contrary, is an enormous metropolis, with crazy prices, crazy transportation, crazy everything. The atmospheres are different, but both of the cities will make you awed, so if you have a chance, you should definitely visit them.

True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5.

                                             Activity #4: Distinguishing Facts from OpinionsDirections: Read the following paragraph. Identify one fact and one opinion in each paragraph (write NONE if there are no fact or opinion present). Write your answer on a clean sheet of paper.1. Egypt is a country in Africa. It is at the north part of the continent. The north side of Egypt borders the Mediterranean. East of it is the Red Sea, Sudan to the south and Libya to the west. Other countries are on its other sides. It is in a very special location. It is a place that is close to Asia. 2. The capital of Egypt is Cairo. That is a really great city. It has been an important city for a long time. It is the largest city in Africa. If you visit that city, you will find a very modern place. You will see many cars. You will see many businesses, schools, and homes. 3. About 82 million people live in Egypt. They have a rich history. Long ago, Egyptians made this the greatest place in the world. They built pyramids. These very smart people invented ways to farm.4. Long ago, Egyptians were wonderful leaders. They built great buildings. They set up schools. They invented a special way of writing. That was called hieroglyphics. They looked like pictures instead of alphabet letters. 5. You will still see hieroglyphics in Egypt today. But they are not used to read and write. They are a part of history. Egypt has a long history. It has been a leader for a long time. If you read Egypt’s history, you will know how great this country has been.6. Today most Egyptians live near the banks of the Nile River. This is where the only good land to farm is. It’s a great place to live. There are other parts that are difficult to live—they are deserts. So not many people live there. 7. About half of Egypt's residents live in cities. Those big cities are in the area of the Nile River. If you go to Cairo, the biggest city, you will find millions of people. 8. Egypt has had some problems. There have been wars. There have been problems of poverty. Poor people in the cities needs jobs. They need homes. Egypt is working to solve those problems. 9. Egypt is making its schools better. The school leaders are making plans to help students learn more. They are planning ways to help parents help their children learn more, too. 10. Egypt is a great country. It has a wonderful history. It will have a great future because people are working hard. They are working together to get more jobs and homes.​</a>

                                            What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

                                            The Presidential Decree No. 474, Executive Order No. 125, as amended, Republic Act No. 9295 and its revised/amended Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the Manila Statement on Enhancement of the Safety of Ships Carrying Passengers on Non- International Voyages through MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 2016 - 02 provides the implementing rules on the phase out of wooden hulled ships carrying passengers in domestic shipping. However, it is very untimely to replace the wooden-hulled boats with the fiber glass and steel-hulled ones. First, the pandemic is still too far from over and life is not stable as before. Many Filipinos have lost their jobs because of this; much more the crews of the 91 wooden-hulled boats that were not allowed to sail again at the onset of 2021. Their means of living simply rely at whenever these boats set sail and traverse the lloilo-Guimaras Strait; this has been their only bread and butter for decades and with this halt in its operation, it will surely post a big impact as to their daily survival even on their basic needs and worst, the education of their children. It must have been painful for both operators, crews and their respective families to lose their source of living amidst this pandemic. Second, the phasing out of the wooden-hulled units was so abrupt that it even posted another problem affecting another set of people; the commuters, small-scale business folks situated at the wharf area and the tricycle drivers. The local government has not provided emergency ambulant boats to cater the volume of passengers; mostly to work and for education, that will be affected by the sudden stoppage of operations of the wooden-hulled units. Long hours were spent in queues with only four modernized boats plying the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait given the volume of passengers coming in and going out of the province. Additionally, with this turn of events, surely, the local economy is highly affected. Small businesses are directly affected by the increase in fare rate in hauling stocks and supplies from the city going to the province as compared with the wooden-hulled transport services. Also, daily commuters earning a minimum wage spares a bigger amount for fare than before; the thirty pesos before is now fifty and when you have to travel to and fro on a daily basis, that's at least a hundred bucks difference in a week! That's something already for them. a Lastly, how sure are we that with the modernized fiberglass and steel-hulled units, there will never be a tragedy at sea? Can we really say that there will never be? Much to our desire of accommodating the modernization program of the government, we must also consider those who will be greatly affected and device win-win situations so as not to forsake other people's welfare in every plight we take.

                                            One of the problems with the modern Olympics is that it has become very big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hosts the games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, and playing fields must be built for the athletic events and housing is needed for the athletes who come from around the world. And all of these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984, Los Angeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companies who wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies like Mc Donald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Many buildings that were already built in the Lost Angeles area were also used again and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas. 1. What is the problem 2.

Identify the main idea and the supporting details. Follow the format below. We often forget how much humans depend on nature. Even city-dwellers living in modern skyscrapers need air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, all of which are provided by nature. True, you can buy bottled water and ready-to-eat meals in supermarkets, but they were not produced there. Some fruits and vegetables, for example, only grow in tropical countries and cross the globe in refrigerated ship containers, to arrive just ripe to your local supermarket. All drinking water ultimately comes from a natural source, since we still do not have the technology to manufacture large amounts of water in the laboratory. The same applies to the air we breathe, which is purified and oxygenated by plants. So, when we speak about preserving nature, we are really also talking about preserving ourselves.

                                            TEXT 1 Given that the influence of mobile technologies on tweeting patterns has been understudied, was sought to bridge this gap by examining whether tweets from mobile and web-based sources differ significantly in their linguistic styles. We studied 6 weeks of Twitter spritzer stream data, containing 235 million tweets. We focused on the analysis of tweets by source—specifically mobile versus web-based sources by time of day. This involved evaluating several categories or subsets in which mobile sources may be similar to or different from web sources. We used word lists from social psychology to test for levels of egocentricity, gender style, emotional content, and agency in both mobile and web tweets.   Academic or Non- academic: _________________________________________________ Reason:__________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________   TEXT 2 Earthquake is a mankind’s deadliest enemy.

                            4. Differences Between Tokyo and Kyoto
In recent decades, the title of one of the most popular cultures worldwide should be definitely given to Japan. Millions of people all over the world study the Japanese language, watch dorama (dramatic TV series on all kinds of topics) or animation, read and write haiku, and make pen pals with Japanese people. Countless people buy tickets and fly to the country of the rising sun to see its wonders with their own eyes.
Among the most popular destinations—mostly because these city names are most known to the western public—are Tokyo and Kyoto. And perhaps for an inexperienced traveler, there is a dilemma: where to go? Mostly, people know that Tokyo is a mega city of the future, and Kyoto has more to do with ancient culture, traditions, and so on. Basically it is true, but at the same time, there also exist more subtle differences one should consider when choosing their destination point in Japan.
The first of them is prices. Tokyo is expensive—as you might expect from the capital of the most urbanized country in the world (the prices below are listed in Japanese yen: 1 USD approximately equals 100 yen). So, to grab some inexpensive snack in Tokyo would cost around 850 yen. Having a three-course meal for two people in a mid-range restaurant, in case you travel with your spouse, will cost you 5,230 yen. A one-way ticket on Tokyo transport costs you 190 yen, and renting one room apartment outside of the city center costs 77,853 yen (and this is probably a weekly price). Just do not expect this apartment to be big and cozy; most likely it will be tiny, with basic utilities, and with no central heating (actually, there is no such thing in Japan at all—everyone warms their house up on their own). If you think of buying an apartment in Tokyo, forget it—one square meter of a room outside of the city center is around 1 million yen (double the price if you want to live closer to the city center).
Kyoto is not much cheaper. Although dining in a restaurant is cheaper—only 4,000 yen for two persons in a mid-range restaurant—transportation costs are surprisingly higher: 235 yen for a ride (however, if you want to purchase a monthly pass, it is cheaper to do in Kyoto rather than in Tokyo: 8,410 yen compared to 10,000 yen). If you think you can save some money buying food in a market, you are correct only in particulars: some products in Japan cost a lot of money no matter where you buy them. For example, white rice costs 850 yen for 1 kg in Kyoto (453 yen in Tokyo). White bread, tomatoes, chicken breasts, and especially cheese—these are the most expensive products both in Kyoto and in Tokyo. Speaking of accommodation, renting or buying an apartment in Kyoto is much cheaper: for a one room apartment outside of Kyoto’s center, you must pay 48,000 yen to rent, or 300,000 yen per square meter if you want to buy it (Numbeo.com).
Tokyo is great to visit if you enjoy hustle and bustle, if you want to feel the heartbeat of a mega-city, dive into its life, and experience all those crazy things people in the West usually tell about Japan. Be prepared for the overcrowded subway— and “overcrowded” is a gentle way to put it; in fact, you can take a 60-minute ride in the subway, and your feet will not even touch the floor, because you will be squeezed between other people so tight that you can even take a nap in this position. Kyoto, on the other hand, is good to visit for all those who feel inspired by traditional Japanese culture: haiku, hanami, court customs, the No theater, and so on. In Kyoto, you will not see amazing skyscrapers, over 280 subway stations, and the craziness of the famous Shibuya crossing; instead, get prepared for temples, tea houses, museums: all things antique and authentic. But, if you want modernity, go to Tokyo, and you will not feel disappointed—this city already lives in the future (Go Overseas).
It is difficult to say which city is better for an inexperienced tourist to visit, Tokyo or Kyoto. Kyoto is cheaper, especially in terms of renting an apartment, and is more suitable for those looking for the old Japanese culture weaved into sophisticated palaces made during Heian-jidai. Tokyo, on the contrary, is an enormous metropolis, with crazy prices, crazy transportation, crazy everything. The atmospheres are different, but both of the cities will make you awed, so if you have a chance, you should definitely visit them.

                            8. DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5.

It has been an important city for a long time. It is the largest city in Africa. If you visit that city, you will find a very modern place. You will see many cars. You will see many businesses, schools, and homes. 3. About 82 million people live in Egypt. They have a rich history. Long ago, Egyptians made this the greatest place in the world. They built pyramids. These very smart people invented ways to farm.4. Long ago, Egyptians were wonderful leaders. They built great buildings. They set up schools. They invented a special way of writing. That was called hieroglyphics. They looked like pictures instead of alphabet letters. 5. You will still see hieroglyphics in Egypt today. But they are not used to read and write. They are a part of history. Egypt has a long history. It has been a leader for a long time. If you read Egypt’s history, you will know how great this country has been.6. Today most Egyptians live near the banks of the Nile River. This is where the only good land to farm is. It’s a great place to live. There are other parts that are difficult to live—they are deserts. So not many people live there. 7. About half of Egypt's residents live in cities. Those big cities are in the area of the Nile River. If you go to Cairo, the biggest city, you will find millions of people. 8. Egypt has had some problems. There have been wars.

                            14. What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

                            15. The Presidential Decree No. 474, Executive Order No. 125, as amended, Republic Act No. 9295 and its revised/amended Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the Manila Statement on Enhancement of the Safety of Ships Carrying Passengers on Non- International Voyages through MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 2016 - 02 provides the implementing rules on the phase out of wooden hulled ships carrying passengers in domestic shipping. However, it is very untimely to replace the wooden-hulled boats with the fiber glass and steel-hulled ones. First, the pandemic is still too far from over and life is not stable as before. Many Filipinos have lost their jobs because of this; much more the crews of the 91 wooden-hulled boats that were not allowed to sail again at the onset of 2021. Their means of living simply rely at whenever these boats set sail and traverse the lloilo-Guimaras Strait; this has been their only bread and butter for decades and with this halt in its operation, it will surely post a big impact as to their daily survival even on their basic needs and worst, the education of their children. It must have been painful for both operators, crews and their respective families to lose their source of living amidst this pandemic. Second, the phasing out of the wooden-hulled units was so abrupt that it even posted another problem affecting another set of people; the commuters, small-scale business folks situated at the wharf area and the tricycle drivers. The local government has not provided emergency ambulant boats to cater the volume of passengers; mostly to work and for education, that will be affected by the sudden stoppage of operations of the wooden-hulled units. Long hours were spent in queues with only four modernized boats plying the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait given the volume of passengers coming in and going out of the province. Additionally, with this turn of events, surely, the local economy is highly affected. Small businesses are directly affected by the increase in fare rate in hauling stocks and supplies from the city going to the province as compared with the wooden-hulled transport services. Also, daily commuters earning a minimum wage spares a bigger amount for fare than before; the thirty pesos before is now fifty and when you have to travel to and fro on a daily basis, that's at least a hundred bucks difference in a week! That's something already for them. a Lastly, how sure are we that with the modernized fiberglass and steel-hulled units, there will never be a tragedy at sea? Can we really say that there will never be? Much to our desire of accommodating the modernization program of the government, we must also consider those who will be greatly affected and device win-win situations so as not to forsake other people's welfare in every plight we take.

                            16. One of the problems with the modern Olympics is that it has become very big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hosts the games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, and playing fields must be built for the athletic events and housing is needed for the athletes who come from around the world. And all of these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984, Los Angeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companies who wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies like Mc Donald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Many buildings that were already built in the Lost Angeles area were also used again and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas. 1. What is the problem 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:The pros and cons of skyscrapers</strong></p><p><strong>4 advantages of tall buildings:</strong></p><p><strong>1. White space in dense cities </strong></p><p><strong>The use of white space or neutral zones in claustrophobic grids creates breathing room for people to move, live, work and play. Although everyday elements are close together, skyscrapers help energise residents and visitors with smart space planning and usage.  </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Environmental impact</strong></p><p><strong>Despite what critics may say, compact urban living encourages people to live with less, taking the emphasis away from owning stuff when storage is limited. Residential skyscrapers are rightly viewed as a strategy to engineer more sustainable cities and reduce consumer waste. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Economic motivation </strong></p><p><strong>The economic benefits of skyscrapers level a skewed playing field, providing opportunity for those suffering from social and financial inequality. In addition to the ownership question, tall buildings allow developers to address housing shortages, injecting more places to live into a prohibitive rental market. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4. Unbeatable views </strong></p><p><strong>The higher you are, the more you can see. Skyscrapers provide inhabitants with those end-of-day views to savour and ponder as they wind down with a glass of wine or a cold one. Imagine the future of Melbourne residents and office attendees if the Green Our City Action Plan goes ahead? </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

Identify the main idea and the supporting details. Follow the format below. We often forget how much humans depend on nature. Even city-dwellers living in modern skyscrapers need air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, all of which are provided by nature. True, you can buy bottled water and ready-to-eat meals in supermarkets, but they were not produced there. Some fruits and vegetables, for example, only grow in tropical countries and cross the globe in refrigerated ship containers, to arrive just ripe to your local supermarket. All drinking water ultimately comes from a natural source, since we still do not have the technology to manufacture large amounts of water in the laboratory. The same applies to the air we breathe, which is purified and oxygenated by plants. So, when we speak about preserving nature, we are really also talking about preserving ourselves.

TEXT 1 Given that the influence of mobile technologies on tweeting patterns has been understudied, was sought to bridge this gap by examining whether tweets from mobile and web-based sources differ significantly in their linguistic styles. We studied 6 weeks of Twitter spritzer stream data, containing 235 million tweets. We focused on the analysis of tweets by source—specifically mobile versus web-based sources by time of day. This involved evaluating several categories or subsets in which mobile sources may be similar to or different from web sources. We used word lists from social psychology to test for levels of egocentricity, gender style, emotional content, and agency in both mobile and web tweets.   Academic or Non- academic: _________________________________________________ Reason:__________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________   TEXT 2 Earthquake is a mankind’s deadliest enemy.
