                        <p><strong>"Reaction Paper: SONA 2018"</strong></p><p>Maraming mahahalagang punto sa nakaraang SONA ni Pangulong Duterte noong Hulyo 23, 2018 ang masasabi nang karamihan na maganda. Ngunit lahat ay napapatanong kung ito ba’y patuloy lamang na mga pangakong napapako. Maraming binanggit ang Presidente ukol sa mga pagbabagong ninanais nyang pagigtingin at pagtibayin sa mga nalalabing taon ng kanyang pamamalakad bilang Presidente ng Pilipinas.
</p><p>Ngunit ang taong bayan ay hati kung itong pagbabagong ito ay magdudulot ng kabutihan o lalo lamang magreresulta sa karahasan at patayan. Kung ating aalalahanin,noong unang pinatupad ang<strong> drug war</strong>, napatigil ang takbo ng buong bansa. Halu-halong reaksyon ang ipinakita ng mga mamamayan. Marami ang nagsasabing mali ang ganoong pamamalakad. Ngunit meron namang nagsasabing ‘yun lang ang nararapat sa mga taong patuloy na umaaasa at gumagamit ng droga.
</p><p>Isa sa mga pagbabagong nabanggit ni Presidente Duterte ang hinggil sa pagpapatupad ng <strong>gobyernong federalismo</strong> na naglalayong bigyan ng kapangyarihan ang mga piling bahagi ng bansa gaya ng Mindanao. Isa itong proposisyon na hati rin ang desisyon maski man din ang mga mambabatas. Hindi maikakaila na patuloy na magkakaroon ng pagtuligsa sa anumang pagbabagong ipapatupad ng gobyerno.
</p><p>Ngunit ang dapat na mas pagtuunan ng pansin ng Presidente ay kung makikinabang ba ang pangkalahatang populasyon ng mga Pilipino sa bansa nang hindi kinakailangang dumanas ang dugo. Kung magagawan lamang ito ng paraan ng Pangulo, maaari nga nating masabi na hindi kamay na bakal ang aahon sa Pilipinas. Kundi isang lider na magiging huwaran kung paano magrespeto ng karapatang pantao, mayaman man o mahirap, sa pamamagitan ng pagkakaroon ng karakter na may dangal.

                        President Rodrigo Duterte takes his second SONA this July and delivers reports, actions taken and currently going, and future plans of His administration as it takes seat in position.     <br /><br />He expresses his efforts about change, in which, according to him, should start from top to bottom, referring to government officials down below to the lowest people in the society.  He speaks about change particularly in the attitude as this is the reason why the Republic is experiencing so much problems especially with regards to poverty.     <br /><br />I agree to his statement about the attitude that should be changed.  Well, attitude really matters because this defines the person we are inside, as well as the discipline inculcated in the Filipino culture.       <br /><br />Again in his speech, he describes drugs as the real menace in the society.  He said that the fight is continuous because illegal drugs, according to him, is a root cause of so much evil.     <br /><br />Well, I do not agree to this statement.  I think it is the love of money, not the money itself, but the love of money, which plays a large role of evil.  People greed about money and power, and so, be it illegal they push it through to gain large sum of money.  He denies the real cause of so much evil, and it is Satan the Devil who really is behind of all evils we are experiencing.  I am not sure if he is aware of this fact.     <br /><br />He also affirms the declaration of Martial Law as the means to wage war against criminality and terrorism in the Mindanao region.  Again, Satan the devil is behind the criminality and acts of injustices happening anywhere in the world, and not the people doing injustices themselves.      <br /><br />He encourages everyone to cooperate, even opposers of his administration.  He calls the attention of industrialists and capitalist to invest here in the Philippines and process raw materials into finished products.      <br /><br />He also warned greedy mining investors to repair the environment they have once used and abused.  He said that they will be closed or taxed to death if they will not comply.      <br /><br />This should be executed immediately because the problem of mining complicates other means of living especially farmers and fishers – people who are most affected by mining industries.  This problem is not new.  If the President really is not aware of this situation, then his statement and after it will be carried out is well spoken of, having praises and grades of 100!     <br /><br />As to the conclusion, my reaction to SONA 2017 is good and to some extent is acceptable.  We must take note however, that whoever intellectual, powerful human takes over the seat of Presidency or whatever high position in the government, the solution does not lies in their hands.  We look forward however, to Jesus model prayer when he says “Let Your Kingdom come...in the Earth as it is in Heaven.”  I believe that it is only the Kingdom of God that could give a real change the situation here on earth.<br />

                        Ayon sa mga survey malaki ang tiwala ng taumbayan sa Pangulong Duterte. Madali lang isipin kung bakit, base sa kaniyang ikalawang State of the Nation Address, halata na ginagawa ng Pangulo ang lahat ng kaniyang makakaya upang matupad ang kaniyang mga pinangako sa Pilipinas. Patuloy parin ang paglaban sa ilegal na droga, patuloy rin ang suporta sa mga sundalo na lumalaban para sa kapayapaan sa Marawi. Hindi rin kinalimutan ng Pangulo ang pangako niyang iwakas ang korapsyon sa gobyerno at mas lalo niyang idinidiin ang kagustuhan niyang mapaalis na ito. Ang kinakailangan lang ng pangulo sa ating mga taumbayan ay tiwala at suporta upang madala niya ang pagbabago sa ating bansa.<br />

                        Essay: The Sona of President Marcos ​<p>When President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. delivered his first State of the Nation Address, it was a momentous occasion (SONA). He began by delivering a dramatic and passionate statement, and it was this speech that laid the groundwork for the remainder of his government. He then spoke on his objectives for the country, namely how he aims to make the Philippines a better place for everyone to reside. Additionally, he told a few jokes, which greatly lightened the tone and put everyone at ease. Overall, the inaugural State of the Nation Address (SONA) was a tremendous success, and I have no doubt that President Marcos will continue to deliver exceptional speeches in the years to come.</p><p></p><p>I especially appreciated how he discussed his <strong>objectives</strong> for the country. I believe he has the capacity to bring about positive change in the Philippines since it is abundantly evident that he has a tremendous desire to see such a change occur. In addition, I enjoyed observing his interaction with the audience members. He was able to preserve his sense of humor while exhibiting his serious side when the situation demanded it. This suggests that he is a president who can connect with the people he serves, a crucial characteristic of a president. I believe that the inaugural State of the Nation Address (SONA) was a resounding success, and I have no doubt that President Marcos will continue to do great things for the Philippines.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about speech here: https://brainly.ph/question/1032884#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

Second thing to mention is the song performance of the president after the <strong>SONA</strong> and lastly the local fabric backdrop.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the <strong>SONA </strong>for me went successful though there are important issues that weren't mentioned like mining and the hot topic about federalism.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Read more here:</p><p>Reaction about SONA 2018</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1658383</p><p>Significance of SONA</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/534096</p><p>Reflection about SONA 2017</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/796115</p>#LearnWithBrainly<br />

                        Ang ikalawang SONA ni Pangulong Duterte ay mayroong mga pagkapareho sa kaniyang unang SONA noong taong 2016. Napag-usapan muli ang war on drugs, ang pagmimina, at ang kalikasan. Ayon sa SONA nagkaroon na ng progreso sa pag tupad ng mga pangako ni Pangulong Duterte sa sambayanan. Halatang binibigyang pansin ng Pangulo ang mga kagustuhan ng tauhan.<br /><br />Ang iba pang mga isyu na hindi nabanggit sa unang SONA ay ang 8888 hotline kung saan naireklamo ng mga tao ang korapsyon sa gobyerno at ang lagay ng trapik sa iba't-ibang lungsod sa Pilipinas.<br />

                        <p><strong>Reaction paper about sona 2018 about your opinion <br /></strong></p><p></p><p>Or did you mean r<strong>eaction paper with your opinion about SONA 2018?</strong><br /></p><p></p><p>So, you need to write a <strong>reaction paper about Duterte</strong> ‘s SONA 2018… all you have to do first before writing anything is to read or to watch the speech.  One cannot make a <strong>Duterte speech reaction paper</strong> if she or he do not know what to react on.<br /></p><p></p><p>While or after watching / reading the speech, write the highlights and then make an outline. With this, you’ll have an organized thought.  You may start with freewriting about your reactions, comments, and opinions before finalizing your reaction paper.<br /></p><p></p><p>How to write reaction paper? There are 3 parts:<br /></p><p></p><p>Introduction – Make it simple and brief.  Add a trivia, figure of speech, quote, or an anecdote. This is to attract readers.  You have to make it catchy and interesting.<br /></p><p></p><p>Sample:  SONA in Filipino is “Talumpatì sa Kalagayan ng Bansâ”.  Thus it must broadcast and inform the citizens about the nation’s current political, economic, and social condition. Emphasis on the word “current”, please.  And this is why a poker face emoji could summarize my reaction and opinions about our current president’s speech last July 23, 2018. <br /></p><p></p><p>Body – The longest paragraph/s.  So this is where you put all your organized thoughts, reactions and opinions.<br /></p><p></p><p>Sample: Yup, a poker face. A simple emoji for a simple speech. It was just like a campaign all over again. Speech is about promises and plans and yet there were few “current” conditions of our nation.  How’s the Martial Law in Mindanao and abusing the Lumad community to give way for mining companies? How’s the real situation of Boracay and the IPs who live there? How are our ancestral lands and our farmers?  How’s the inflation because of TRAIN Law? How about the war on drugs yet the drug lords are still powerful and the 6.4 billion pesos worth of shabu scandal is still unsolved?  How about the killings of mayors, priests, and activists? He mentioned contractualization yet he said his executive power wasn’t enough to end it.  Who’s going to remind him about his campaigns when he was running for presidency?  He added anti-corruption campaign yet he is an ally of the Marcos family and Arroyo. No mention about education and teachers being one of priorities, too. Yet it was a short speech… in English.  Now that’s a change.  How about let’s ask the ordinary citizens (not trolls) if they did understand and felt the speech?<br /></p><p></p><p>Conclusions – Summarize your reaction.<br /></p><p></p><p>Sample:  Some would say every SONA, people will always have criticisms and negative feedback.  I think it is much better to point out the flaws to correct them rather than be optimistic yet there are no progress.  Evil doers love silence and blind followers. If the administration is not betraying public trust and is not truly tyrannical, they will welcome oppositions, protests, feedbacks, and outcries. They will welcome, listen, and change for the better. <br /></p><p></p><p>…<br /></p><p></p><p><strong>Looking for Duterte SONA reflection?: Reflection paper about SONA 2018 - https://brainly.ph/question/1661925<br /></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Looking for SONA reaction tagalog?: Reaction paper about sona of duterte 2018.

                        <p>SONA 2018 Reaction Paper Sample<br />Duterte’s Third SONA: Full of Surprises<br /><br />Historically, the third Monday of July is set up for the President of the Philippines to deliver a speech of his accomplishments and his plans for the next few months of his tenure. It has also become a carnival of sorts in the last few years for fashion mavens in the Senate and the House of Representatives to showcase their gowns and barongs to the full view of the masses. The hitherto political spectacle has sometimes become a circus of sorts.<br /><br />That is not to mention yet, the annual mass demonstrations of anti-government organization bent on shouting their mantras and showing off their artistic skills as they brandish their effigies reflecting the different issues affecting the Philippines. The past few years, it has become a demonstration of people who have several points of contention against the Duterte administration – from women’s groups, to urban poor groups, to youth organizations – everyone seems to have a point against the regime. What started out as a promising tenure, with invitations to pro-poor leaders and anti-government personalities has since become an interesting tableau of ideas and perspectives that still has four more years in play.</p><br />

                        President Duterte's second SONA of his presidential term was very similar in delivery to most of his other speeches. His delivery, filled with emotion and at some points spontaneity was very well received by his supporters, with the president boasting an 82% approval rating in Pulse Asia's last survey.<br /><br />The president discussed the matters that his administration has been very focused on such as the war on drugs, the status of Marawi, the continued corruption in the government, and the challenges and successes of infrastructure development in the country.<br />

                        <p>“I have always believed that no matter how well-intentioned a leader is, no matter how well-conceived may be his mission, if he lacks the political will to do what needs to be done, then he can only end up a failure and a hopeless dreamer.” Ito ay ang mga katagang talagang tumatak sa akin, sa nakalipas na SONA ng ating Pangulong Duterte. Kilala natin siya bilang isang matigas at matibay na lider, na gagawin kung ano ang nararapat, madami mang tumutol dito.</p><p></p><p>Ang politika ay isang maruming laro. Sa tinatagal ng ating pangulo sa larangang ito, marami siyang naging mga kaaway at mga kaibigan. Sa ating kultura, inaasahan mong kung kaibigan ka ng isang tao na may mataas na posisyon, ikaw ay magtatamasa ng mga pabor at mga benepisyo. Ngunit sa mga nakalipas na buwan, marami-rami na ring kaibigan ng pangulo ang kanyang tinanggal mula sa puwesto dahil sa korapsyon. Ang SONA ngayong taon ay tila isang tanglaw ng pag-asa para sa mga mamamayan. Ang mga proyekto ng pangulo na kanyang isinusulong tulad na lamang ng paglaban sa droga at korapsyon, mga subsidiya para sa mga mahihirap at ang libreng edukasyon sa tertiarya ay parte ng bagong simula na sana ay maging matagumpay. Sa kasalukuyan, ang pagpapalit din ng klase ng pamahalaan na sinubukan ng mga nakaraang presidente ay mas may pag-asa na, na maipatupad. Hindi ito magiging madali, sigurado yun, at madaming hahadlang para sa kanilang pansariling dahilan, kung kaya’t tayo bilang mga mamamayan ay dapat hindi maging mangmang. </p><p></p><p>Sa tinagal-tagal ng panahon, tayo  ngayon ay nabiyayaan ng isang mamumuno na handang gawin ang lahat, magawa lamang ang tama. Sa wakas ay mayroon na tayong pinuno na matibay ang paninindigan, at handang magsakripisyo para sa kabutihan ng lahat. Ano nga naman ang gamit ng talino, kung wala namang kumikilos at gumagawa? Sa dami ng magagandang reporma na nasa SONA, gustuhin man ay hindi ito kaya ng isang tao lamang. Ito ay isang produkto ng nagkakaisang sambayanang Pilipino.</p><br />

                        <p>My reaction about the State of the Nation Address (SONA) of
the President Rodrigo R Duterte for this year 2017 is regret. Why? I am the one
who thinks that he wasted his time talking about things which are not too
necessary. He was not, once more, able to update us about the status of his
2016 SONA promises as well as his concrete plans for the future.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, there are more chances next time. I hope that, by
that time, he would be able to provide the people a clearer picture regarding
criminality, poverty, transportation, education, employment, and many others.</p><br />

Some of the <strong>SONA 2017 highlights </strong>are as follows:</p>He appealed for the passage of the Land Use Act, which will enable the efficient allocation of natural resources and sustainable developmentThe president called on the Congress to pass a law that will establish a specific department to respond to disastersThe establishment of Citizen’s Complaint Hotline 8888The continued implementation of K to 12 program, which was first introduced by the then-administration of former President Benigno Simeon Aquino IIIThe introduction of the health care’s “No Balance Billing” policyThe implementation of the nationwide smoking ban or the Executive Order 26Further improvement of sea connectivity and land transportation, including Roll on-Roll off portEmphasis on sustainable environmentThe introduction of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program of 2017, which is in the form of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN), which will be further discussed on this link: https://brainly.ph/question/1205529<p>All the aforementioned <strong>SONA 2017 topics</strong> are more or less affecting the current state of the economy. In particular, the passage and the eventual enactment of the TRAIN law enabled the Philippine inflation rate to surge upwards. The trend seemed to have a devastating effect not only on the middle class workers but to the poorest of the poor. Market prices of various commodities and services soared. Apart from the continuing increases on fuel prices, goods, and other services, the purchasing power of the ordinary Filipino family has also decreased. The rate exchange between the United States dollar (USD) and the Philippine peso (PHP) is the lowest in 13 years. However, President Duterte’s economic managers remain optimistic that everything will be turned to good. But then, this “goodness” that the economic managers are hopeful for, may come late and every family below the poverty line will continue (until then) to suffer from hunger and ballooning debt. </p><br /><p>The <strong>SONA 2017 summary</strong> to be aptly put is a lost opportunity for the President to address the real issues that affect the common people.

Overall in my opinion, I felt a slight hint of regret for the President because he wasted the opportunity to further discuss what he wanted to do for the Philippines. He was not able to comprehensively discuss the current path of the country including the status of all the promises he made and introduced during his first SONA in 2016. What he did was rant and curse against his political enemies, which we have all been accustomed with ever since he won the presidency.</p><br /><p>Despite this, we should be all remain hopeful that the president would further clarify the issues that currently affect the country. Issues that are particularly affecting the masses.

                        <p>The<strong> STATE OF THE  NATION ADDRESS</strong> of <strong>President Rodrigo Duterte </strong>touched on many topics like Foreign Policy, Corruption even Boracay. But it is his stand on drugs that brought him his popularity.
</p><p>
</p><p>        <strong> The president made it clear that his conviction cannot be swayed when it comes to dealing with drug dealers and users. In fact, he said no amount of criticism will change his direction and he intends to intensify the ongoing drug war.
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>         I think the president is not hiding anything when it comes to what he wants, and although some of us may disagree in the way he does his job, we would have to agree that he appears to be a very transparent leader.

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Tandaan na sa paggawa ng isang reaksyon o reaction
paper ay dapat mayroon itong apat na bahagi:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>1.      
Panimula – Halimbawa, isang
paunang tanong, “Kailangan ba talaga nating pakinggan, panoorin o basahin ang
SONA ng pangulo?”  Maaari kang maghanap
ng mga quotation at slogan. Pwede ka ring kumuha ng ilang mga pahayag ni
Duterte sa kanyang SONA gaya ng “Umalis kayo diyan. Sabihin ko sa mga Lumad.
Bobombahin ko iyan, isali koi yang mga istraktura. I will use the Philippine
Air Force.” At pagkatapos magbigay ng ganito ay maaari ka nang magbigay ng mga
sarilo mong pananaw at punto ukol sa pagbabanggit ng mga isyung panlipunan na
nabanggit sa SONA o hindi nabanggit sa SONA. Tandaan na ang introduksyon ng
reaksyon paper ay mahalagang sangkap sa pagbuo ng mga susunod na talata.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2.      
Katawan ng Reaksyon Paper – Ito
ang talata kung saan maghahain ka na ng iyong mga reaksyon. Maglalabas ka rito
ng iyong mga opinion, kuro at kahit pa haka kaugnay sa SONA ni Duterte. Kung
susundan natin ang unang halimbawa ng panimula, maaaring umikot sa reaksyon mo
na dapat ay nakatutok ang lahat sa SONA at marapat lang na walang pasok ang
lahat ng estudyante at mga nagtatrabaho para pakinggan ang State of the Nation
Address. Nave-verify kasi natin kung totoo o hindi totoo ang mga sinasabi ng
pangulo.<br /><br /></p>

<p>3.      
Konklusyon – Dito naman ay pagbubuod
ng lahat ng iyong napag-isip-isip at naramdaman kaugnay sa SONA ni Duterte.
Maaaring gawin mo itong konektado sa mga sinabi mo sa introduksyon o panimula
para magkaroon ng mas kaaya-ayang ugnayan ang kabuuan ng iyong reaction paper.
Kung susundan ang panimula at katawan ng reaksyon paper, maaari kang maglagay
ng isang katanungan na “Ano nga ba ang mangyayari kung hindi natin
bibigyan-pansin ang SONA ng pangulo ng bansa natin?” at sagutin din ito.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4.      
Listahan ng mga sources – Optional
ito pero recommended. Dito kasi ay masisilip kung anu-ano ang iyong mga
pinagkuhanan ng impormasyon. Ito ay pagbibigay credit sa kung saan mo nabasa o
napanood ang paksa ng iyong reaction paper na sa kasong ito, kung saan mo
nabasa, narinig o napanood ang SONA ng pangulo. </p>

                        President Rodrigo Duterte takes his second SONA this July and delivers reports, actions taken and currently going, and future plans of His administration as it takes seat in position.     <br /><br />He expresses his efforts about change, in which, according to him, should start from top to bottom, referring to government officials down below to the lowest people in the society.  He speaks about change particularly in the attitude as this is the reason why the Republic is experiencing so much problems especially with regards to poverty.     <br /><br />I agree to his statement about the attitude that should be changed.  Well, attitude really matters because this defines the person we are inside, as well as the discipline inculcated in the Filipino culture.       <br /><br />Again in his speech, he describes drugs as the real menace in the society.  He said that the fight is continuous because illegal drugs, according to him, is a root cause of so much evil.     <br /><br />Well, I do not agree to this statement.  I think it is the love of money, not the money itself, but the love of money, which plays a large role of evil.  People greed about money and power, and so, be it illegal they push it through to gain large sum of money.  He denies the real cause of so much evil, and it is Satan the Devil who really is behind of all evils we are experiencing.  I am not sure if he is aware of this fact.     <br /><br />He also affirms the declaration of Martial Law as the means to wage war against criminality and terrorism in the Mindanao region.  Again, Satan the devil is behind the criminality and acts of injustices happening anywhere in the world, and not the people doing injustices themselves.      <br /><br />He encourages everyone to cooperate, even opposers of his administration.  He calls the attention of industrialists and capitalist to invest here in the Philippines and process raw materials into finished products.      <br /><br />He also warned greedy mining investors to repair the environment they have once used and abused.  He said that they will be closed or taxed to death if they will not comply.      <br /><br />This should be executed immediately because the problem of mining complicates other means of living especially farmers and fishers – people who are most affected by mining industries.  This problem is not new.  If the President really is not aware of this situation, then his statement and after it will be carried out is well spoken of, having praises and grades of 100!     <br /><br />As to the conclusion, my reaction to SONA 2017 is good and to some extent is acceptable.  We must take note however, that whoever intellectual, powerful human takes over the seat of Presidency or whatever high position in the government, the solution does not lies in their hands.  We look forward however, to Jesus model prayer when he says “Let Your Kingdom come...in the Earth as it is in Heaven.”  I believe that it is only the Kingdom of God that could give a real change the situation here on earth.<br />

                        Mahalagang okasyon ang bawat State of the Nation Address ng kahit sinumang Pangulo dahil ito ay pagkakataon nila para makausap ng diresto ang taumbayan. Sa kaniyang ikalawang SONA, ipinahawag ni Pangulong Duterte ang mga nagawa ng kaniyang administrasyon tulad ng, pagpatuloy ng laban sa ilegal na droga, ang pagpalawak ng mga daang pandagat, ang pagtingin sa solusyon para sa trapik na nararanasan ng mga lungsod ng Pilipinas. Mukhang tinutupad naman ng pangulo ang kaniyang mga ipinangako noong siya'y nangangampanya, ngunit mahaba pa ang panahon bago matapos ang pagkapangulo ni Pangulong Duterte, kailangan natin ihintay ang pangako ng pagbabago kung ito man ay darating.<br />

                            27. REACTION PAPER ABOUT SONA 2017.
PLS ANSWER</h2><br />
                        Reactions on President Duterte's Second SONA<br /><br />The second SONA highlighted the government's accomplishments especially on war against drugs and criminalities. Duterte during the election campaign period promised to resolve these in just six months but failed to bust and requested for extension saying he was shocked by the extent of the drug problem.<br /><br />Same with previous SONA, thousands of protesters and militant groups rallied near the Batasan to denounce the recently approved extension of Martial law in Mindanao until December 31 and to assert that the president’s promise of change has not been realized. Protests meanwhile was peaceful and orderly.<br /><br />Some activists claims Duterte's first year was “a major flop in addressing the pressing economic and social imbalances only to be highlighted by blood and gore.”<br /><br />While the president also emphasized his plans for a tax reform program to raise the national budget, it must be studied thoroughly as it is branded as regressive and anti-poor by certain groups. For instance, House Bill 5636 for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), will come with a P10-per-liter tax. This will apparently dissuade consumers from purchasing SSBs. According to the Philippine Association of Store and Carinderia Owners (PASCO), the imposition of SSB tax will result to 3% to 200% rise in prices.<br /><br />READ: Is the Proposed Beverage Tax Anti-Poor?<br /><br />The president also showed his eagerness to stop violence and rebellion in Mindanao and said that Mighty Corporation's P25 billion tax settlement can be used for the rebuilding of Marawi. However, he did not mention the immediate actions to settle the issue.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) was certified as urgent by Duterte administration. "BBL is key to just and lasting peace."<br /><br />While there's a lot of issues that need to be resolved, Filipinos are hopeful that Duterte will deliver his promised change during the course of his presidency. This is evident of the “excellent” trust rating he received in the latest Pulse Asia Research's June 2017 Ulat ng Bayan survey, 82% nationwide.<br /><br />"Believe me, it is easier to build from scratch than to dismantle the rotten and rebuild upon its rubble. Let us work together and lay a new foundation in which a better Philippines can be reconstructed. Help me build a better tomorrow," Duterte ended his speech.<br /><br />
