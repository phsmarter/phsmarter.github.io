There are plenty of such plants in the vicinity of your houses. By observing social distancing and other health protocols, you may want to interview your neighbors or elders in the community who are familiar with the uses of said crops. Get a planting material, and plant it in any reusable container and document its growth and development. Make sure to water it and expose to sunlight then take a photo of it every two weeks.
