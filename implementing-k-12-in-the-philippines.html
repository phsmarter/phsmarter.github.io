                                            HELPLet's reform the K-12 programFilipino students face a serious gap in leaming as a result of the world's longestcommunity lockdown that put them out of physical classrooms for nearly two years.What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmedWaste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education.The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the UnitedNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, hadthe longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered,breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020.Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce.And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parentsscrambling for resources to sustain their children's education.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program.The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation.What now with K-12?Like-minded educators are proposing that K-12 be optional, especially for industries that can accommodate short-course holders.Processing Questions:1.

Complete the table by writing thestatements that fall under fact, judgement and actionThe K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providingsufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, producelifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurshipand employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added twoyears of Senior High School (SHS) The courses that can be learned from SHS includeaccounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary andhospitality workAlthough the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there isstil a mismatch between our schooling system and working system As regards theimplementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materialsprovided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materialsfor one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack ofsufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem.Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers aswell. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with theimplementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016.Despite these observations, Department of Education (DEPED) is optimistic that theseshortages and problems will overcame as they claim that these are being addressedMeanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) laudeDepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its Chairman, additional twoyears of education should not be seen as a burden.(Barrot, 2016, p. 92)FACTJUDGEMENTACTION​pa helpp!</a>

                                            Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

3. Charter Schools Are About Making Choices
"Public charter schools belong to the public schooling system. It means that they follow the accepted teaching standards. These institution must demonstrate the effectiveness of their established methods.
4. At par with the world 
before K to 12 became a law in 2013, Philippines was one of the last three countries in the world that still implement a ten-year basic education program. With this, students finish high school at an average age of 16. This age is not yet employable. Aside from that, students didn't have mastered or specialized  skill that was useful for job-seeking.

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author?

What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmed Waste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education. The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, had the longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered, breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020. Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce. And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parents scrambling for resources to sustain their children's education. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program. The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation. What now with K-12? Like-minded educators are proposing that K-12 be optional, especially for industries that can accommodate short-course holders. Processing Questions: 1.

"Public charter schools belong to the public schooling system. It means that they follow the accepted teaching standards. These institution must demonstrate the effectiveness of their established methods.
4. At par with the world 
before K to 12 became a law in 2013, Philippines was one of the last three countries in the world that still implement a ten-year basic education program. With this, students finish high school at an average age of 16. This age is not yet employable. Aside from that, students didn't have mastered or specialized  skill that was useful for job-seeking.

                            27. Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />

                            30. Let's reform the K-12 program Filipino students face a serious gap in leaming as a result of the world's longest community lockdown that put them out of physical classrooms for nearly two years. What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmed Waste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education. The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, had the longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered, breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020. Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce. And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parents scrambling for resources to sustain their children's education. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program. The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation. What now with K-12? Like-minded educators are proposing that K-12 be optional, especially for industries that can accommodate short-course holders. Processing Questions: 1. What is the news all about? 2. What is your reaction about the news? 3. Do you agree or disagree with what the news stated?​</h2><br />

The news is about the failure of the K-12 program in the Philippines, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and the prolonged school closures that resulted in a significant learning gap among students. The program is now being reviewed by the current administration.</p><p></p><p>2.)  -------- </p><p></p><p>3.) the news presented some valid concerns regarding the K-12 program's implementation, such as its inadequacy and the significant learning gap among students caused by prolonged school closures. It is necessary to assess the program's effectiveness and make necessary improvements to ensure that it can better serve the students' educational needs.</p><br />
