                            9. Life of a face to face student during this pandemic. ESSAY</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic effect on the lives of face-to-face students all around the world. Students have been forced to adapt to a new way of learning, which can be a difficult transition. For face-to-face students, the pandemic has caused immense disruption to their daily routines and lifestyles. </p><p></p><p>One of the biggest adjustments that face-to-face students have had to make is dealing with the shift to remote learning. For many, this means having to attend classes from home, relying on digital resources to stay connected to their peers, instructors, and course materials. This can be a difficult transition for students accustomed to in-person learning. It can be difficult to focus and stay motivated when learning remotely, and lack of face-to-face interaction can leave students feeling isolated and disconnected.</p><p></p><p>Another major challenge for face-to-face students has been the impact of the pandemic on extracurricular activities. For many, being able to take part in activities such as sports, clubs, and events outside of the classroom is an integral part of their college experience. However, with the pandemic, many of these activities have been put on hold or cancelled altogether. This can</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many drastic changes to our daily lives. For students, in-person classes have been replaced with online classes, which can be much more challenging. As a student, it can be difficult to stay focused and motivated when learning from a computer screen. Face-to-face classes provide a more engaging learning experience, allowing for more interactive and collaborative learning. With the gradual reopening of schools, many students will have the opportunity to participate in a face-to-face class this year.</p><p></p><p>A face-to-face class can be a great way to learn and develop relationships with other students and the teacher. This type of class provides a more immersive learning experience, as students can directly interact with the teacher and ask questions. There is also the benefit of being able to physically participate in activities and discussions. This can help to increase student engagement and understanding of the material. Additionally, in-person classes can provide a sense of community, as students can get to know each other better and work together to solve problems.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also challenges associated with face-to-face classes. Health and safety must be taken into consideration when attending classes in person. This means that social distancing, mask wearing, kept clean, and other safety protocols should be strictly adhered to. Additionally, it can be difficult to keep students focused and on task when they are physically present in the classroom. It is important for teachers to create an environment that is conducive to learning and keep students engaged.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, attending a face-to-face class this year can be a great opportunity for students to benefit from an interactive and engaging learning experience. However, it is important to remember to follow all safety protocols and to stay focused and motivated in the classroom. With the right attitude and preparation, students can make the most of this unique experience.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly and deeply changed our lives in a way comparable with the most traumatic events in history, such as a World war. With millions of people infected around the World and already thousands of deaths, there is still a great uncertainty on the actual evolution of the crisis, as well as on the possible post-crisis scenarios, which depend on a number of key variables and factors (e.g. a treatment, a vaccine or some kind of immunity). Despite the optimism enforced by the positive results recently achieved to produce a vaccine, uncertainty is probably still somehow the predominant feeling. From a more philosophical perspective, the COVID-19 drama is also a kind of stress-test for our global system and, probably, an opportunity to reconsider some aspects underpinning it, as well as its sustainability. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In this article we focus on the pre-crisis situation by combining a number of selected global indicators that are likely to represent measures of different aspects of life. How was the World actually performing? We have defined 6 macro-categories and inferred their relevance from different sources. Results show that economic-oriented priorities correspond to positive performances, while all other distributions point to a negative performance. Additionally, balanced and economy-focused distributions of weights propose an optimistic interpretation of performance regardless of the absolute score.</p><br />

The learning process was not trivial. Because every child has a challenge to be able to absorb everything that is obtained in education, both formal and informal. That way, I also feel that it is important to have a good spirit and a fighting spirit through a guide that I call <strong>a philosophy of life</strong>. That in this period of being a student, I must be able to enjoy every process, whatever it is, the ease, difficulty, obstacles, challenges, fatigue, and so on. I also try to do my best in every learning process that I participate in. It's not about "numbers", but about the struggle and passion that I put into each process.</p><p>             In any position and time, this life presents a variety of very beautiful processes, whether you expect them or not. So even though I'm still a student right now, I need to enjoy the process and my journey. I enjoy it because it makes me feel grateful and always remember God.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more about the material about the philosophy of life : https://brainly.ph/question/574982</p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>virtually all K-12 students in the United States are currently missing face-to-face instruction due to COVID-19. Many parents and educators thus share a common worry: When the pandemic subsides, kids will return to school with lower achievement. There are also concerns that the gap between high- and low-achieving students will become larger. Given the need to address these concerns, we decided to use prior test scores from millions of students and leverage research on summer learning patterns to make informed projections of what learning loss due to the pandemic might look like. Ultimately, we wanted to know: What sort of learning losses could we expect from the shortened 2019-20 school year?</p><p></p><p>Answering this question is complicated by the unique circumstances of COVID-19. Current school closures have added to the time that most students already spend at home during the summer months without explicit face-to-face instruction from teachers. Meanwhile, teachers are scrambling to adapt content for an online platform and parents are juggling work responsibilities (if not joblessness) with caring for and educating their own children. Students themselves are faced with isolation, anxiety about a deadly virus, and uncertainty about the future. In so many ways, the current situation is unprecedented for most people alive today.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Make u fly out of India and no one is in touch for a few </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My area has just become one of the most infected areas of my state. Things are much different than they used to be. I defiantly feel the panic from others as grocery stores sellout of things like toilet paper or bottled water. I feel the panic from our leaders, who have put policy in place to hopefully end this virus in the near future. I think the reaction is appropriate and I appreciate everything that people are doing to help stop the spread, no matter how boring it may be.
</p><p>
</p><p>I can confidently say that my life has indeed changed. I am a senior in high school, and this was not how I was planning to spend my senior year. Every day I wake up and “go” to online school. I do my work and then workout. I eat at the times we normally would eat. My routine is extremely repetitive, and we have only been doing this for a few weeks. I understand that we may have to do this for a long time, and I am fully willing to do so in hopes that we can return to normal soon.
</p><p>
</p><p>I think the biggest challenge for me has been realizing that I might never go to my high school again to thank the teachers who changed my life and finally graduate after waiting four long years. It is hard that I must make a college decision in a time like this, but I also understand that there are many people out there who are not in the same position I am at the moment, so I am grateful for my opportunities and my blessings. However, I do feel that there is good in this situation. I plan on going to college across the country, so I am glad I can spend time with my family before I leave. I believe that the future is uncertain going forward. I always ask myself if things will ever go back to what I consider “normal”. I hope that it will, and I hope that I will get the opportunity to do the things I want to do in my life. I think that there is something to be learned, but I just do not know what it is yet. I hope we can fight this together and come out stronger.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Student life is meant to help us learn discipline and study. Despite that, life is quite enjoyable. The struggle is low in student life. One must get up early in the morning to get ready for school or college. Similarly, rushing to the bus stop is very exciting during student life. The mothers constantly remind us to hurry up and not be late. It is no less than a mantra for all mothers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In addition, there are other exciting moments in student life. We sometimes forget to complete our homework and then pretend to find the notebook when the teacher asks for it. With the examination time around the corner, the fun stops for a while but not long. One of the most exciting things about student life is getting to go on picnics and trips with your friends.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You get to enjoy yourself and have a  lot of fun. Even waiting for the exam result with friends becomes fun. The essence of student life lies in the little things like getting curious about your friend’s marks, getting jealous if they score more, and so on. The excitement for games period or learning about a new teacher. While student life teaches us discipline, it also gives us a lot of fun. It is a memorable time in everyone’s life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Student life is a vital part of everyone’s life. The future of the students and the country depends on how we are as students. Thus, getting the right guidance is essential. Student life builds the foundation for our life. Thus, if your foundation is strong, the building will be a strong one too. However, a weak foundation cannot make a building stand. In other words, student life helps us embrace human qualities.</p><p></p><p></p><p>People don’t realize how lucky and privileged one is to even get a student life. Many children dream of having it but never get one. Thus, if one gets to attain education, one must make the most of it. Student life won’t always be filled with happiness but it will be worthwhile. It helps us grow in the path of life and acquire qualities such as honesty, patience, perseverance, and more.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Student life is one of the most memorable phases of a person's life. The phase of student life builds the foundation of our life. In student life, we do not just learn from books. We learn to grow emotionally, physically, philosophically as well as socially. Student life is the best phase of life which is like a complete roller coaster full of ups and downs . The only thing students are scared are of grades or superiority or being famous that's all. </p><p></p><p></p><p>All in all, student life is no less than perfect. Even though it has many ups and downs, it is all worth it in the end. Our student life determines a lot of things in our lives later on. Therefore, we must strive to be good students not just academically but also in other aspects. It is like a backbone to have a successful life later on.</p><p></p><br />

The course materials and activities may be accessed from any computer, whether it is from the University or from the comfort of your own home. I've taken two online courses since I've been in college and have benefited from those classes. There are a few reasons to why I'm drawn to an online education course as opposed to taking courses in a traditional classroom setting. First of all, I have a full-time job, which limits my opportunities to attend classes scheduled during normal school hours. Also online classes allow me to work on my own and move at my own pace. Finally, these classes offer more of a one-on-one teacher-student relationship rather than a teacher having to spread their focus amongst thirty other students.</p><p></p><p>Having a full time job makes it very difficult to schedule your classes. The hours I have scheduled at my job conflict with the times that most classes are offered. The use of online courses has made life at work easier, since my manager refuses to work around school schedules. Since I don't have to meet on a regularly basis, I don't have to leave my job to meet on campus. It is very convenient for me not having to meet on a regular basis. When a person has to work full time, it is hard for that person to successfully juggle their job responsibilities along with homework and study. A person can always take an online course to deal with the time constraints that a job will put on you. The use of online courses allows you to cover the material needed in school while maintaining your workload.</p><p></p><p>I've learned that to be a successful distance learner, you have to be self-disciplined and able to work well on your own. Since you won't be physically going to class each week, you can take part in class from the comfort of your own home. You must be self-disciplined because the instructor won�t constantly be there to remind you of assignments or of project deadlines. Other obligations may mean that you are not able to do the work as regularly as if you were physically attending class, it will be up to you to make sure that you are keeping up with all the work for the course. Also, one of the main objectives of college is to become a well-rounded individual, with the skills needed to successfully manage a busy agenda.</p><p></p><p>The first online course I took, I just thought that the work for the course could be put off until I had time to do the work. In doing this, I got very far behind. It took me awhile to catch back up with the assignments and I promised myself that I would never let that happen again. The students who procrastinate about their assignments, usually either wind up withdrawing from the course late in the semester because they have fallen far behind or receiving an "F" in the course because they have not completed the required class-work by the time the course is over. A student should leave time in their schedule in order to complete the online courses successfully. Although online classes are more convenient, than traditional college classes, they should be looked at as typical college classes and not taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>Being able to communicate with instructors and other students, that are taking these courses, has made me be a more active participant during the courses. With the two online courses I�ve taken, I have never felt it difficult to communicate with my instructor to ask for help or clarification of an assignment. All of these instructors and the students taking these classes have been very helpful to me. The online courses offer a discussion board to send posts to your fellow students. You get a chance to read and critique each other�s work and respond to the comments of your classmates. I�ve learned that by discussing each other�s ideas we are in turn challenging each other to examine our own thoughts and feelings. This makes class work more interesting as we get a chance to share personal experiences in the discussion while improving on our writing style.</p><p></p><p>Any student that is interested in taking an online course should do research on the class and speak with the instructor before enrolling. Personally, I would recommend online courses to anyone that has a busy schedule, such as having a full time job or having family responsibilities. Also, you are able to learn well by doing the required work on your own, without depending solely on interaction with other students as a means of learning. Online courses are a great alternative to the student who must hold a full-time job while enrolled in college. Online courses are not only convenient but they teach you how to become a more disciplined scholar.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#PLEASE MARK ME AS BRAINLY<br />

                        <p>The pandemic has been a challenging time for students in a number of ways. Perhaps the most significant change is that many students have had to move to online learning. This can be a challenge for some, as it can be difficult to stay motivated and focused when learning from home. Another big change for students is that they may not be able to see their friends and classmates in person as often. Social distancing measures have made it hard for people to meet up, which can be tough for young people who thrive on social interaction. Despite all of these challenges, though, many students are managing to adapt and make the best of their situation.</p><br />
