                                            Gospel According to John, the author retells a conversation between Jesus of Nazareth, who is on trial, and Pontius Pilate, the governor of the Roman province of Judaea. Toward the end of the interrogation, Jesus tells Pilate, “Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” Infamously, Pilate responds, “What is truth?” Pilate’s tone is not clear. Was he asking a genuine question out of curiosity? Was he being sarcastic? Or was he asking the question in desperation, following a lifelong, exhausting search for the truth? We don’t know. What we do know is that he didn’t stick around for an answer. So, what is truth? Philosophers have struggled with this question since the dawn of time, perhaps because it’s the hardest question ever asked. The field of epistemology is the subdiscipline of philosophy that grapples it, along with the nature of knowledge itself. The question, “What do we know and how do we know it?” occupies the mind of the epistemologist. The prevailing theory of truth, at least among the public and certainly among scientists, is the correspondence theory, which states that truth corresponds with facts and reality. It’s a good theory, especially since it’s practical and governs our day-to-day interactions. If I’m holding a tart, reddish-yellow, spherical fruit, I’m holding a Cosmic Crisp apple. There is no alternative theory of truth that could convince me that it’s a limousine. Likewise, business contracts, the judicial system, and society as a whole are built around the idea that truth corresponds to reality. Science still can’t answer the biggest — and arguably, most important — questions in life. Many scientists would take this a step further and argue that the scientific method is the foremost system for determining facts. Therefore, science is the best tool to determine reality and truth. But this is where things start to get tricky. Philosophers vs. Scientists At least two philosophers have presented substantial challenges to the epistemic privilege of science. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), David Hume argues that inductive logic is unjustified. Inductive logic is the process of making observations and then drawing larger conclusions from limited data. When astrophysicists make a claim like, “All stars are flaming balls of hydrogen and helium,” that grand, sweeping claim is based on observing lots and lots of stars and observing the same thing over and over again. But they haven’t observed all the stars in the universe. Further, there is no guarantee that future stars will resemble past stars. So how can they really know for sure? That might sound like a childish objection, but consider this: At one time, Europeans believed that all swans are white. After all, everywhere they looked, they saw white swans. The swans on the river, the swans on the lake — all white. But then, one intrepid European (Willem de Vlamingh) went to Australia in 1697 and saw black swans. In this instance, inductive logic failed. This is the basis of Hume’s argument that inductive logic is unjustified. ​</a>

During this time, the knowledge of navigation was developed, and a navigational university was established in Europe7. A navigational invention of Europeans which was developed by the Arabs. This instrument is used in measuring the sun and star angles and recording the exact time of sunrise and sunset8.

                                             Activity 1 Directions: Write YES on the space provided if the paragraphs are examples of an editorial introduction and NO if not. 1. The warning labels on cigarette cartons tell the story: smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, premature birth and injury to babies born to smokers. Yet, despite the dangers, cigarettes are readily available in convenience stores, gas stations, and liquor stores 2. Cigarettes are deadly; the risks are real; the benefits are nonexistent. The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarettes altogether. 3. A new generation is emerging who have never known life without the internet or social media. How will their consumer behavior and spending patterns shape businesses in the future? And as more Gen Zs enter the workforce, how will their new ideas and approaches alter the workplace?4. Many students are scrambling-much like their professors to adopt to this virtual learning environment we have been abruptly tossed into. For some, this may be an easy, or perhaps even welcome, transition. That is dependent on several factors. The first factor, which cannot be understated, is the home-life of students who have transitioned back to their familial residences. Many students have chaotic homes, filled with family members who have been forced to work or attend school remotely. This puts a strain on internet capabilities as well, which further dampens the educational potential of these online courses.5. With scientists still trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and any possible cure still several months away from mass production, the consequences of reopening classes in the country's crowded need careful consideration. Technology allows remote learning, and efforts must be ramped up to make this universally accessible. With public health threat expected to persist for months, alternative learning modes must be promoted.​</a>

                                            LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</a>

Social inequalities are present in all kinds of community whether in the local, national or global level. 8.

THEORY
THEORY is an idea that is suggested or presented as possibly true but that is not known proven or to be true.THEORY is also a well sustained explanation acquired through scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through explanations observations and experimentation.
Example:
Alfred Weneger,shown her on a trip to Greenland in 1912-1913 proposed his ideas about continental drift as early as 1912,a concept later incorporated into the revolutionary theory of plate tectonics
LAW:
LAW describes the behavior of nature the universe under certain conditions usually expressed as in a mathematical equations.Law is also a statement based on repeatedly experimental observation that describes some aspects of the universe.
EXAMPLE OF LAW:
Newton's second law of motion can be formally stated as follows:The Accelaration of an object as produced by a net force is directly Proportional to the magnitude of the net force,and inversely proportional to the mass of the object</h2><br />
                        That's right! And hypothesis should be testable and must be proven<br />

                            6. Gospel According to John, the author retells a conversation between Jesus of Nazareth, who is on trial, and Pontius Pilate, the governor of the Roman province of Judaea. Toward the end of the interrogation, Jesus tells Pilate, “Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” Infamously, Pilate responds, “What is truth?” Pilate’s tone is not clear. Was he asking a genuine question out of curiosity? Was he being sarcastic? Or was he asking the question in desperation, following a lifelong, exhausting search for the truth? We don’t know. What we do know is that he didn’t stick around for an answer. So, what is truth? Philosophers have struggled with this question since the dawn of time, perhaps because it’s the hardest question ever asked. The field of epistemology is the subdiscipline of philosophy that grapples it, along with the nature of knowledge itself. The question, “What do we know and how do we know it?” occupies the mind of the epistemologist. The prevailing theory of truth, at least among the public and certainly among scientists, is the correspondence theory, which states that truth corresponds with facts and reality. It’s a good theory, especially since it’s practical and governs our day-to-day interactions. If I’m holding a tart, reddish-yellow, spherical fruit, I’m holding a Cosmic Crisp apple. There is no alternative theory of truth that could convince me that it’s a limousine. Likewise, business contracts, the judicial system, and society as a whole are built around the idea that truth corresponds to reality. Science still can’t answer the biggest — and arguably, most important — questions in life. Many scientists would take this a step further and argue that the scientific method is the foremost system for determining facts. Therefore, science is the best tool to determine reality and truth. But this is where things start to get tricky. Philosophers vs. Scientists At least two philosophers have presented substantial challenges to the epistemic privilege of science. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), David Hume argues that inductive logic is unjustified. Inductive logic is the process of making observations and then drawing larger conclusions from limited data. When astrophysicists make a claim like, “All stars are flaming balls of hydrogen and helium,” that grand, sweeping claim is based on observing lots and lots of stars and observing the same thing over and over again. But they haven’t observed all the stars in the universe. Further, there is no guarantee that future stars will resemble past stars. So how can they really know for sure? That might sound like a childish objection, but consider this: At one time, Europeans believed that all swans are white. After all, everywhere they looked, they saw white swans. The swans on the river, the swans on the lake — all white. But then, one intrepid European (Willem de Vlamingh) went to Australia in 1697 and saw black swans. In this instance, inductive logic failed. This is the basis of Hume’s argument that inductive logic is unjustified. ​</h2><br />

                            8.  Activity 1 Directions: Write YES on the space provided if the paragraphs are examples of an editorial introduction and NO if not. 1. The warning labels on cigarette cartons tell the story: smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, premature birth and injury to babies born to smokers. Yet, despite the dangers, cigarettes are readily available in convenience stores, gas stations, and liquor stores 2. Cigarettes are deadly; the risks are real; the benefits are nonexistent. The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarettes altogether. 3. A new generation is emerging who have never known life without the internet or social media. How will their consumer behavior and spending patterns shape businesses in the future? And as more Gen Zs enter the workforce, how will their new ideas and approaches alter the workplace?4. Many students are scrambling-much like their professors to adopt to this virtual learning environment we have been abruptly tossed into. For some, this may be an easy, or perhaps even welcome, transition. That is dependent on several factors. The first factor, which cannot be understated, is the home-life of students who have transitioned back to their familial residences. Many students have chaotic homes, filled with family members who have been forced to work or attend school remotely. This puts a strain on internet capabilities as well, which further dampens the educational potential of these online courses.5. With scientists still trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and any possible cure still several months away from mass production, the consequences of reopening classes in the country's crowded need careful consideration. Technology allows remote learning, and efforts must be ramped up to make this universally accessible. With public health threat expected to persist for months, alternative learning modes must be promoted.​</h2><br />

                            9. LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</h2><br />
