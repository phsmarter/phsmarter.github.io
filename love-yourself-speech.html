                                            Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</a>

                                            Speech About Friendship Have you ever noticed that when a friend is happy you find yourself happy too, even when it has nothing to do with you? A true friend is like a mirror. Do you know why ? its because they reflect yourself. When I say that, I mean by emotionally, spiritually and much more. When you're happy, they're happy and when you're sad, they're feeling pretty much the same way you're feeling too. People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what a true friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally. They do have their little angry long moments from time to time but at the end of the day all is forgiven and forgotten. True friends are very rare to find but once you've found them, don't let them go because not everyone has true friends even if they're popular and famous. I hope all of you as my audience get the true meaning of friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends. A B. Type of Speech (2 points each) 1. 5. 1. 5. 6. 2 6.

Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

When I say that, I mean by emotionally, spiritually and much it has nothing to do with you? A true friend is like a mirror. Do you know why ? its when more. a true the same way you're feeling too. People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship and love is.

Friends love unconditionally. They do have their little angry long moments from time find but once you've found them, don't let them go because not everyone has true friends even friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends. if they're popular and famous.

Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

Yan po Sana po matulungan nyo po ako please Learning Task 4: READ ME Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</h2><br />

                            13. Speech About Friendship Have you ever noticed that when a friend is happy you find yourself happy too, even when it has nothing to do with you? A true friend is like a mirror. Do you know why ? its because they reflect yourself. When I say that, I mean by emotionally, spiritually and much more. When you're happy, they're happy and when you're sad, they're feeling pretty much the same way you're feeling too. People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what a true friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally. They do have their little angry long moments from time to time but at the end of the day all is forgiven and forgotten. True friends are very rare to find but once you've found them, don't let them go because not everyone has true friends even if they're popular and famous. I hope all of you as my audience get the true meaning of friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends. A B. Type of Speech (2 points each) 1. 5. 1. 5. 6. 2 6.

                            19. Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.
