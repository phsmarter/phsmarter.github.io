Mental Health is important in a person’s life.
Yet it is one of the problems of the youth these days.
Let’s have a quick talk about Mental Health
But First, I am Daniel Andrei Marbibi from 7-Agoncillo.
Mental health is a condition where a person meets his/her emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Mental Health is also triggered by stress caused by “ stressors “ that produce stress.
Stressors are things that produce stress such as bullying, failure, people, and others.
Stress can be classified into two, Eustress and Distress.
Eustress is positive stress and example of these are Winning a competition, having support from your family, and feeling important.
While Distress is negative stress and example of these are being physically abused, being bullied in school, having bad grades, and being scolded by your parents. This is also the cause of depression, anxiety, bad eating habits, insolation, and even worse health habits like smoking, using drugs, and sleeping pills.
When you are feeling these types of Distress, go to some people that can understand you such as your Family, Friends, A Psychotherapist, your teacher, or even your school’s Guidance Counselor.
There is no way to avoid these Mental problems. As we continue our life, we will have these problems over and over again but every time we’ll have them, we can resolve them, and we can learn to get through them with the help of others.
And That is all I am Daniel Andrei Marbibi leaving you with this quote of mine.
“If you have a problem in life, remember it and learn from it as you go through”</a>

                        A SPEECH ABOUT FAMILY<p>A mother, a father and a child is a basic picture of what a <strong>family</strong> is. If there is more than one child, then it means a picture of a bigger <strong>family</strong>. In the Philippines, strong family ties is practiced. This means that even if the children in a certain family have built another<strong> family</strong> of their own, they still live together making the house a bigger crowd. This explains why there are grandma and grandpa in a house. It is because Filipinos do not want to lose their past <strong>family</strong> even if they already have their new and own. Past <strong>family </strong>means your mother, father and siblings. New <strong>family</strong> is your wife/husband and children. In the family starts the foundation of love. </p><p>Often than usual, the<strong> family backs you up</strong> in times of trouble and problems. If you found out that your friends are fakes and you have down and bad times in your career, you can always go back home and ask a pat from your <strong>family</strong>. They are <strong>the ones who do not leave us</strong> through ups and downs. They <strong>lift our spirits</strong> even if they do not understand the situation. When people turn their backs, the <strong>family is there to rescue</strong>. Mother, father and siblings are not just the<strong> family</strong> we have but also the relatives who hold us in their hearts the way we hold them in ours. So when you are in trouble right now, <strong>don’t hesitate to tell your family</strong>, you may hear reprimands but you can always count on their support.

Mental Health is important in a person’s life.
Yet it is one of the problems of the youth these days.
Let’s have a quick talk about Mental Health
But First, I am Daniel Andrei Marbibi from 7-Agoncillo.
Mental health is a condition where a person meets his/her emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Mental Health is also triggered by stress caused by “ stressors “ that produce stress.
Stressors are things that produce stress such as bullying, failure, people, and others.
Stress can be classified into two, Eustress and Distress.
Eustress is positive stress and example of these are Winning a competition, having support from your family, and feeling important.
While Distress is negative stress and example of these are being physically abused, being bullied in school, having bad grades, and being scolded by your parents. This is also the cause of depression, anxiety, bad eating habits, insolation, and even worse health habits like smoking, using drugs, and sleeping pills.
When you are feeling these types of Distress, go to some people that can understand you such as your Family, Friends, A Psychotherapist, your teacher, or even your school’s Guidance Counselor.
There is no way to avoid these Mental problems. As we continue our life, we will have these problems over and over again but every time we’ll have them, we can resolve them, and we can learn to get through them with the help of others.
And That is all I am Daniel Andrei Marbibi leaving you with this quote of mine.
“If you have a problem in life, remember it and learn from it as you go through”</h2><br />
                        <p>The script looks good overall, but there are a few minor changes that can be made for clarity and accuracy. Here are some suggestions:</p><p></p><p>1. In the second sentence, consider adding "in society" after "youth" to clarify that mental health is a problem among young people in general.</p><p></p><p>2. In the paragraph discussing stress, consider adding a definition of stress itself before introducing stressors. This will help readers understand the concept more fully.</p><p></p><p>3.
