                            1. essay about argumentative essay about technology. advantage and disadvantages of having a technology in the campus​</h2><br />
                        <p>Technology has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, including in the field of education. With the rapid advancement of technology, schools and universities have integrated technology into their curriculum and campus infrastructure. However, the use of technology in the campus has been the subject of debate, as it has both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will argue for and against the use of technology in the campus.</p><p></p><p>One of the major advantages of technology in the campus is its ability to enhance the learning experience. With the help of technology, students can access a vast array of educational resources, including online libraries, educational videos, and interactive software. This allows for a more personalized and interactive learning experience. Moreover, technology enables collaboration between students and teachers through online discussion forums and video conferencing.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage of technology in the campus is its ability to increase efficiency. With the use of technology, students can submit their assignments online, eliminating the need for printing and physically submitting papers. This saves time and resources for both students and teachers. In addition, technology can be used to automate administrative tasks, such as attendance tracking and grade recording, reducing the workload of teachers.</p><p></p><p>However, the use of technology in the campus also has its disadvantages. One of the major drawbacks is its potential to distract students from their studies. With the widespread use of social media and other entertainment applications, students may become more interested in browsing the internet than focusing on their studies. Moreover, the over-reliance on technology may lead to a decline in traditional skills, such as handwriting and critical thinking.</p><p></p><p>Another disadvantage of technology in the campus is its cost. The integration of technology requires a significant financial investment, including the purchase of hardware and software, as well as the cost of maintenance and upgrades. This may not be feasible for all educational institutions, particularly those in developing countries or those with limited resources.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while technology has brought significant advantages to the campus, it is not without its drawbacks. Therefore, it is important for educational institutions to strike a balance between the use of technology and traditional teaching methods, and to be mindful of its potential impact on students and the learning process. The proper integration of technology in the campus can enhance the learning experience and increase efficiency, but it must be done in a way that is responsible and sustainable.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Electronic businesses have become extremely popular in the recent years. More and more people prefer to buy and sell products and services online. It is rather important for those, who are in e-commerce business, to realize all advantages and disadvantages of performing their business over the internet or other computer networks. In the modern technological era business leaders have to be accustomed to such issues as internet marketing, electronic funds transfer, online transaction processing, supply chain management, automated collection data systems, inventory management systems and electronic data interchange (Kelly, 2005). Using a SWOT analysis will give the opportunity to improve better methods and strategies while conducting an e-commerce business. That is why it is essential to be well aware of the appropriate information, knowledge, experience and great desire to succeed in business, no matter whether it is small or big. The understanding of the main principles and techniques of conducting an e-commerce business will give the advantage to increase the company`s revenues and incomes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Electronic </strong><strong>Business</strong></p><p></p><p>Conducting electronic business online has advantages and disadvantages. To identify these features, the business owners are prone using SWOT analysis.. The internal strengths of my business were a wide range of capabilities it could have in future, because of the innovations and technology it could provide in the business operation. Experience, knowledge and data are real strengths to develop it into well-established. The personnel possess professional experience, deep knowledge in the marketing environment and professional skills. The company`s data is a valuable source that can be implemented into achieving its objectives. As to the weaknesses, lack of capabilities may be identified because of the competition in the market, where other e-commerce companies are selling the same products and services. It is essential to overcome the lack of competitive gap. While estimating the company`s opportunities, it has become obvious that it reaches the target markets making a good profit. Innovation and technology development is a good tendency that is currently occurs in the business process. Making e-commerce business globally gives a great opportunity to open new markets and find new customers. New contracts and partners are rather threatening to e-commerce. It is hard to identify what kind of partners and customers could be met online. Sometimes new contracts do not give desired results and profit. Loss of resources is another threat. It is not easy to find new sources of resources, thus, e-commerce may lose the money. The research reported that it is very important to identify all these positive and negative factors while achieving the company`s objectives (Kotler, 2009). </p><p></p><br />

Technology help us to connect to our family, it help us to get some news and be updated to what’s happening in the world. However, despite of these advantages, there’s a lot of disadvantages. Example is people depend too much on social medias and do not check if it the news is reliable. Also, people are more focused in social media and a lot of people are getting stressed in using technology. Most of the students are always on their gadget and do not mind the school works they have. Always remember that it’s okay to use technology but remember that we also have limits. <br /><br /> hope this helps!<br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Technology has been a part of our lives and it plays a crucial role in almost everything that we do nowadays. Using it on our daily basis definitely has an advantage for us because it makes our work easier and faster. It's easy for us to communicate with our loved ones and friends with the aide of gadgets and we can always look for information about something that we don't know. In addition, having technology keep us to be always informed and updated especially now that we are in the middle of a pandemic, may it be updates in the cases of COVID-19 or news about the current happenings worldwide. However, having technology still have disadvantages, for me, having these makes us more invested to social media and it's like it limits our personal connection with our peers and family. We don't spend enough time with our families anymore because we're all busy clicking the keyboard and facing the screens of our gadgets. It makes us unsocial and we became pretenders behind our social media life. As a 21st century student, it affects me in a sense that it's easier for me to research for informations about a certain topic that I don't understand and I can always look for those anytime, with different sources, I can learn many things. Technology really helped me a lot especially now that our situation is hard, but no matter how it helped me a lot, it's still important to use it properly. As a student, we should use technology in a way that we could gain knowledge and could improve our skills, we shouldn't take it for granted just because we have an access. </p><br />
