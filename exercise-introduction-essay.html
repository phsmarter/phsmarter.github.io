                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        I’ll answer the first topic which is “Should school be taught online instead of in a classroom?”<br /><br />To answer that question in my personal opinion, no.<br /><br />You see, there are a lot of benefits regarding studying at school more than online. You see your friends more, and interact socially with people, and you absorb more knowledge that way since a teacher is teaching you. Not self taught or whatever. You can also go to different rooms whenever you have different classes which I think kind of contributes to getting fit.

                            15. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent. Giving respect to others is a way of exercising and multiplying our quality of respect, which will inevitably earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, giving respect to all individuals is crucial, and it is an innate quality that we possess. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others, and it helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others. By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />
