                                            As our society develops, people also change their focus and starts to shift their living and profession from simple and basic to a more modern and post-industrialize. Parents are now sending their children to school instead of managing their lands. As a result, our economy cannot cope up with the food needed for the whole society. Farming became costly and undermined by the many. Can you explain using theories why this is happening? ​</a>

Education is an important aspect that plays a huge role in the modern, industrialized 
world. People need a good education to be able to survive in this competitive world. 
Modern society is based on people who have high living standards and knowledge which allows them to implement better solutions to their problems.
An educated person is more likely to develop better moral and ethical values as 
compared to an uneducated person. Lack of education creates problems like superstition, domestic violence, poor health, and poor living standards. It brings equal opportunity for both men and women and educated people will be able to create a better society.
