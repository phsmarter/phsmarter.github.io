Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019.

A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</a>

                                            Study Habits play a significant part in the academic life of every student. It is one of the ingredients thatcompletes to the overall success of the child in school. A good study habit in the formative years of the child couldbe carried on by the child throughout his life. That is why, the formation of the best study habit early is veryimportant to know especially among parents and teachers.Without study habit, a person may not grow and become self-limiting in life. Many areas of our life require ahabitual act of doing things. As the adage goes "Your habit becomes your destiny", a life worth living for is a productof an everyday choices that we make.According to Robinson (2000) the keys to better learning and better academic performance in schools aregood teachers, good study environment, the course of study, parents' cooperation, high quality books and, the mostimportant, the study habits. Investigating the nature of study habits is important because factors related to studyingsuch as motivation and specific study techniques have been linked to academic success.Many students fail not because they lack ability, but because they do not have adequate study skills (Menzel1982). Study habit is the tendency of a student to learn in a systematic and efficient way, when opportunity is given.It is also defined as the devotion of time and attention to acquire information or knowledge especially from booksor in other words, it's the pursuit of academic knowledge by a detailed investigation of a subject or situation (OxfordDictionary &amp; Thesaurus of English Language, 2003).Thus, in order to improve academic performance of students, it seems essential to improve their study habitswithout which desired outcomes cannot be achieved. Development of good study habits in children depends uponthe combined efforts of parents and teachers (Kizlik, 2001).Robinson (2000) found that certain bad study habits result in poor academic performance, whereas certaingood study habits result in high academic performance. Creemers and Reynold (2000), on the basis of data of theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, demonstrated a positive relationship between good study habits andacademic performance of 8th and 9th Grade students.Although there is a substantial amount of research available on the study habits and academic performancethere is no available research on this topic in Dumaran Central School. Other researchers have also pointed towardsa positive relationship between study habits and academic performance (Fatima, 1967; Siddique, 1989). Studies inPakistan have revealed the relationship of academic performance with intelligence and emotional intelligence(Shujja, 2008; Khalid &amp; Ahmad, 2009).These various studies related to the study habit and academic performance of the students lead to theformulation of this research topic. The aimed of this study is to find out the study habits of pupils in Dumaran CentralSchool and how it affects to their academic performance.Answer the following:1. What was the excerpt all about?2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Education is not entirely the key to success and students need to know this way before they graduate. Parents, teachers and society should stop deceiving and destroying young people’s lives and future with their false claims of what education is.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>First, there should be clarity in the fact that being successful in life does not mean building houses, having many cars, huge amount of money in various bank accounts among others. Frankly speaking, that is the kind of success mostly perceived for us by our parents. We (I am directing this specifically to African Society) need to understand that success is relative. Being successful to me is maximizing your potential to the fullest and achieving set goals in life. And there is no way we can all have the same potential. If my aim is to become a fashion designer, being successful is becoming that fashion designer and even exceeding my boundaries as a fashion designer. All those luxuries automatically come with it.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The irony of all of this is, some people who were deemed for success will end up working for people who were considered failures. Like Bill Gates rightly put it ‘I failed in some subjects in exam, but my friend passed in all. Now, he is an engineer in Microsoft and I am the owner of Microsoft’. This is not to say that those who are academically gifted will end up working under those who aren’t but the point is, success is relative. Probably that engineer being referred to in this context wanted to be and he is but the problem will be if Bill Gates was judged based on failing some of his exams and his friend will be the successful one. Who would have had the last laugh?</strong></p><p></p><br />

Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019.

WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2.

                            14. Study Habits play a significant part in the academic life of every student. It is one of the ingredients thatcompletes to the overall success of the child in school. A good study habit in the formative years of the child couldbe carried on by the child throughout his life. That is why, the formation of the best study habit early is veryimportant to know especially among parents and teachers.Without study habit, a person may not grow and become self-limiting in life. Many areas of our life require ahabitual act of doing things. As the adage goes "Your habit becomes your destiny", a life worth living for is a productof an everyday choices that we make.According to Robinson (2000) the keys to better learning and better academic performance in schools aregood teachers, good study environment, the course of study, parents' cooperation, high quality books and, the mostimportant, the study habits. Investigating the nature of study habits is important because factors related to studyingsuch as motivation and specific study techniques have been linked to academic success.Many students fail not because they lack ability, but because they do not have adequate study skills (Menzel1982). Study habit is the tendency of a student to learn in a systematic and efficient way, when opportunity is given.It is also defined as the devotion of time and attention to acquire information or knowledge especially from booksor in other words, it's the pursuit of academic knowledge by a detailed investigation of a subject or situation (OxfordDictionary &amp; Thesaurus of English Language, 2003).Thus, in order to improve academic performance of students, it seems essential to improve their study habitswithout which desired outcomes cannot be achieved. Development of good study habits in children depends uponthe combined efforts of parents and teachers (Kizlik, 2001).Robinson (2000) found that certain bad study habits result in poor academic performance, whereas certaingood study habits result in high academic performance. Creemers and Reynold (2000), on the basis of data of theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, demonstrated a positive relationship between good study habits andacademic performance of 8th and 9th Grade students.Although there is a substantial amount of research available on the study habits and academic performancethere is no available research on this topic in Dumaran Central School. Other researchers have also pointed towardsa positive relationship between study habits and academic performance (Fatima, 1967; Siddique, 1989). Studies inPakistan have revealed the relationship of academic performance with intelligence and emotional intelligence(Shujja, 2008; Khalid &amp; Ahmad, 2009).These various studies related to the study habit and academic performance of the students lead to theformulation of this research topic. The aimed of this study is to find out the study habits of pupils in Dumaran CentralSchool and how it affects to their academic performance.Answer the following:1. What was the excerpt all about?2.
