                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

This study examined the relationship of book and e-book, this paper tends to identify in 1 affects reading comprehension. Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</a>

Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus: The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________ Easy Warm-up: ________________________ Fire Starter: ________________________ Audience Reader:_________________________ 2. GOLBAL WARMING: Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects. POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________ EASY WARM-UP:_________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ______________________ FIRE STARTER: ________________________ AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence, POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________ EASY WARM-UP:______________________ FIRE STARTER:________________________ AUDIENCE READER:___________________Dito na lang Po pa answer&lt;3​</a>

Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</a>

Novel Corona Virus:The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________Easy Warm-up: ________________________Fire Starter: ________________________Audience Reader:_________________________2. GOLBAL WARMING:Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects.POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________EASY WARM-UP:_________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________AUDIENCE READER:_____________________3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ______________________FIRE STARTER: ________________________AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence,POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________EASY WARM-UP:______________________FIRE STARTER:________________________AUDIENCE READER:___________________​</a>

There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</h2><br />

Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus: The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________ Easy Warm-up: ________________________ Fire Starter: ________________________ Audience Reader:_________________________ 2. GOLBAL WARMING: Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects. POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________ EASY WARM-UP:_________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ______________________ FIRE STARTER: ________________________ AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence, POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________ EASY WARM-UP:______________________ FIRE STARTER:________________________ AUDIENCE READER:___________________Dito na lang Po pa answer&lt;3​</h2><br />

                            19. What are the 3 claims in ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY ON CYBERBULLYING.
Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</h2><br />

Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus:The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________Easy Warm-up: ________________________Fire Starter: ________________________Audience Reader:_________________________2. GOLBAL WARMING:Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects.POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________EASY WARM-UP:_________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________AUDIENCE READER:_____________________3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ______________________FIRE STARTER: ________________________AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence,POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________EASY WARM-UP:______________________FIRE STARTER:________________________AUDIENCE READER:___________________​</h2><br />
