Activity Directions: Read the selection and answer the questions that 
follow.
Xyza and Xyriel are twins. Their mother tells them that even when 
they look alike, they have different attitudes. Xyza is more outgoing 
and I love sports. She also convinced her mom to enroll her in a 
dancing school, for she really loves dancing. Someday, she wants to 
win an international award for being a good dancer. On the other 
hand, Xyriel prefers solitary activities more. She loves drawing and 
painting. Xyriel is always with her sketch pad, and she loves 
traveling because she finds new things to draw in every place she 
visits. They both help their mother in doing house chores. They also 
study their lessons very well. Xyza and Xyriel may have different 
hobbies and personalities, but no matter how different they are, 
they really love each other, and wish they could reach their dreams 
in the future.

                                            Should our school have a civilian attire day? by Mary Catherine Siena (An Excerpt) High school students like us, who are mostly teenagers, find many ways to express ourselves. Sometimes, we like to express ourselves through art like those cool drawings and paintings we find in our Visual Arts classroom or the small doodles we draw in our notebooks. However, one of the simplest ways we express ourselves is through the clothes that we wear. Hence, I believe that we should have a day for civilian attire. Source: Language in Literature K to 12 (2020) Questions: 1. Based on the text, what are some ways people express themselves? 2. Are these ways similar to or different from the way you express yourself? If so, in what ways are they the same or different? 3. What is the purpose of the author in writing the essay? 4. Do you agree or disagree with the author's stance? Explain.​</a>

                                            Summarize the short essay below. This object, the camera, is very important nowadays since our generation is incredibly tech-savvy. It is very useful to those who are fond of capturing special moments. This object is also essential to people who are into photography and vlogging. In much earlier times, people had to draw or paint pictures just to have a copy, and it would take hours to achieve the desired results and be able to show it to others. But with a camera, it only takes a few clicks if your goal is to show someone how beautiful or unique something is. In a lot of ways, using a camera is like compiling research. Research serves as our tool for building knowledge and facilitating learning. It nourishes our minds and introduces to us new discoveries. A camera can also serve as a tool for preserving new discoveries and sharing them with others. Without the camera, ordinary people without artistic inclinations would not be able to do so.  ​</a>

Activity Directions: Read the selection and answer the questions that 
follow.
Xyza and Xyriel are twins. Their mother tells them that even when 
they look alike, they have different attitudes. Xyza is more outgoing 
and I love sports. She also convinced her mom to enroll her in a 
dancing school, for she really loves dancing. Someday, she wants to 
win an international award for being a good dancer. On the other 
hand, Xyriel prefers solitary activities more. She loves drawing and 
painting. Xyriel is always with her sketch pad, and she loves 
traveling because she finds new things to draw in every place she 
visits. They both help their mother in doing house chores. They also 
study their lessons very well. Xyza and Xyriel may have different 
hobbies and personalities, but no matter how different they are, 
they really love each other, and wish they could reach their dreams 
in the future.

                            13. Should our school have a civilian attire day? by Mary Catherine Siena (An Excerpt) High school students like us, who are mostly teenagers, find many ways to express ourselves. Sometimes, we like to express ourselves through art like those cool drawings and paintings we find in our Visual Arts classroom or the small doodles we draw in our notebooks. However, one of the simplest ways we express ourselves is through the clothes that we wear. Hence, I believe that we should have a day for civilian attire. Source: Language in Literature K to 12 (2020) Questions: 1. Based on the text, what are some ways people express themselves? 2. Are these ways similar to or different from the way you express yourself? If so, in what ways are they the same or different? 3. What is the purpose of the author in writing the essay? 4. Do you agree or disagree with the author's stance? Explain.​</h2><br />

                            23. Summarize the short essay below. This object, the camera, is very important nowadays since our generation is incredibly tech-savvy. It is very useful to those who are fond of capturing special moments. This object is also essential to people who are into photography and vlogging. In much earlier times, people had to draw or paint pictures just to have a copy, and it would take hours to achieve the desired results and be able to show it to others. But with a camera, it only takes a few clicks if your goal is to show someone how beautiful or unique something is. In a lot of ways, using a camera is like compiling research. Research serves as our tool for building knowledge and facilitating learning. It nourishes our minds and introduces to us new discoveries. A camera can also serve as a tool for preserving new discoveries and sharing them with others. Without the camera, ordinary people without artistic inclinations would not be able to do so.  ​</h2><br />
