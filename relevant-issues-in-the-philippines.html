It believes the past is illuminated by historians as well as scholars from other disciplines; at the same time, it prefers ethnographic approaches to the history of the present. It welcomes works that are theoretically informed but not encumbered by jargon. It promotes a comparative and transnational sensibility, and seeks to engage scholars who may not be specialists on the Philippines. Founded in 1953 as Philippine Studies, the journal is published quarterly by the Ateneo de Manila University through its School of Social Sciences."</p><p> .</p><br />

                        One example of a social issue in the Philippines that can be analyzed using the structural functionalist approach and Sikolohiyang Pilipino is poverty. Poverty is a major social issue in the Philippines, with more than 25% of the population living below the poverty line. Structural functionalism can be used to analyze poverty in the Philippines by looking at the structural factors that contribute to and maintain poverty, such as unequal access to resources, limited economic and educational opportunities, and unequal access to health care.<br /><br />Sikolohiyang Pilipino, or Filipino psychology, can be used to further analyze poverty in the Philippines. This approach looks at poverty from a cultural perspective, taking into account the Filipino values of interpersonal connectedness, collectivism, and resilience in understanding the experiences of poverty. For example, researchers using this approach may look at how the Filipino culture of resilience and interdependence has allowed families to cope with poverty and how collective action has been used to address poverty-related issues.<br /><br />Using Filipino perspectives to analyze our own social problems is beneficial as it allows us to view the issue from a more holistic and culturally-specific perspective. It also allows us to better understand the lived experiences of those affected by the issue, which can provide insight into the root causes of the issue and potential solutions. Additionally, by considering Filipino values, we can develop interventions that are culturally appropriate and more likely to be successful in addressing the issue.<br />

                        <p>1. The <strong>central idea/message</strong> of this speech is the need for racial justice and equality in America. </p><p><strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong> describes the ongoing struggle of African Americans for freedom and equality, despite the promises made by the founders of the nation in<strong> the Constitution</strong> and <strong>the Declaration</strong> <strong>of Independence</strong>. He emphasizes the urgency of the situation and calls for immediate action to address the "shameful condition" of racial discrimination and segregation in the country.</p><p>2. The particular issues did <strong>dr. king mention</strong> in his speech issues facing African Americans at the time, including segregation and discrimination, poverty, and lack of access to opportunities and <strong>fundamental rights</strong>.</p><p>In his speech, <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong> mentions several specific issues facing <strong>African Americans</strong> at the time, including segregation and discrimination, poverty, and lack of access to opportunities and fundamental rights. He also references<strong> the Emancipation Proclamation </strong>and the promises made in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, which were not being upheld for African Americans. <strong>King's speech</strong> is a call to action to address these issues and create a more just and equal society for all Americans.</p><p>3. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream for America is<strong> a society </strong>where all people are treated with dignity and equality, regardless of their race. </p><p>He envisions a country where segregation and discrimination are abolished and where<strong> African Americans</strong> and other marginalized groups have access to the same opportunities and rights as everyone else. In his famous "<strong>I Have a Dream</strong>" speech, he describes a future America where people "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character" and where children of all races can "join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!" King's dream is one of racial harmony and equality, where all <strong>Americans</strong> can live together in peace and prosperity.</p><p>4. Many of the issues addressed by <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong> in his speeches and writings are still relevant today, not only in the United States but also in the Philippines and other countries around the world. Some of the key issues that he addressed that continue to be relevant today include <strong>discrimination</strong> and <strong>prejudice</strong> based on race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors; inequality and lack of access to opportunities and basic rights for marginalized groups; and the need for social and political action to address these issues and create a more just and equal society. These issues are still present in the Philippines and other countries, and addressing them remains a crucial task for <strong>leaders </strong>and <strong>activists working</strong> to promote social justice and equality.</p><p>5. There are several reasons why <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>'s "I Have a Dream" speech is considered an inspirational and iconic moment in American history. One reason is <strong>the powerful </strong>and emotive language used by King in the speech, which effectively conveys the frustration and anger felt by many African Americans at the time, as well as their<strong> hopes </strong>and <strong>aspirations </strong>for a better future. </p><p>The speech also includes a number of memorable and powerful phrases and images, such as the reference to the <strong>Emancipation Proclamation</strong> as a "great beacon light of hope" and the metaphor of a "check" that has come back marked "insufficient funds." Additionally, King's delivery of the speech is considered to be <strong>powerful</strong> and <strong>compelling</strong>, with his passionate and confident voice inspiring many listeners. Overall, powerful language, memorable imagery, and passionate delivery make "I Have a Dream" an enduringly <strong>inspirational speech</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Martin Luther King Jr. here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/249478</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                            20. 1. What is the most relevant issue in the Philippines that shows lack of respect to dignity? Explain how it affects human dignity. 
2. In today’s era, what do you think is the most alarming issue when it comes to the lack of respect for truth? What do you think must be done in order to eradicate this issue? Explain your answer.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.One of the most relevant issues in the Philippines that shows a lack of respect for dignity is the prevalence of extrajudicial killings, particularly in the context of the government's war on drugs. This issue has been widely criticized by human rights groups and international organizations due to the high number of deaths and the lack of due process in the killings.</p><p>Extrajudicial killings undermine human dignity in several ways. First, they deny individuals the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence, which are fundamental principles of human dignity. Second, they often target marginalized and vulnerable communities, such as the poor, drug addicts, and indigenous peoples, which exacerbates the inequalities and discrimination that they already face. Third, they create a climate of fear and insecurity, which can lead to self-censorship, social isolation, and distrust among individuals and communities.</p><p></p><p>To address this issue, the Philippine government must ensure that human rights are respected and protected, including the right to life, due process, and access to justice. This can be done by conducting impartial and independent investigations into the killings, holding accountable those responsible for them, and providing reparations to the victims and their families. The government should also strengthen its justice system, including its law enforcement agencies, to prevent extrajudicial killings from happening in the future.</p><p></p><p>2.In today's era, one of the most alarming issues when it comes to the lack of respect for truth is the spread of misinformation and disinformation, particularly online. With the proliferation of social media platforms and digital technologies, false information can be easily created, disseminated, and amplified, often with little or no regulation or accountability.</p><p>The spread of misinformation and disinformation undermines the truth, which is essential for democracy, human rights, and social justice. It can lead to confusion, polarization, and division among individuals and communities, erode trust in institutions and leaders, and undermine the credibility of science, journalism, and expertise.</p><p></p><p>To eradicate this issue, there must be a concerted effort from multiple actors, including governments, civil society organizations, media outlets, and technology companies. Governments can promote media literacy and critical thinking skills in schools and communities, enact laws and regulations that hold online platforms accountable for the spread of false information, and invest in public education campaigns that promote the importance of truth and accuracy.</p><p></p><p>Civil society organizations and media outlets can fact-check and verify information, promote transparency and accountability in public institutions, and encourage public engagement and participation in democratic processes.</p><p></p><p>Technology companies can develop and implement algorithms and tools that detect and remove false information, promote media literacy and critical thinking skills, and collaborate with governments and civil society organizations to promote responsible use of digital technologies.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Why does Philippines have high poverty rate?</p><p></p><p>The Philippines has a fairly high poverty rate with more than 16% of the population living below the poverty line. Because of the many people reliant on agriculture for an income and inequality in wealth distribution, about 17.6 million Filipinos struggle to afford basic necessities.</p><br />

Philippines. Explain its effect in our society?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Science and technology and innovation have become key elements in making a country advanced and progressive. </strong></p><p>In many countries, they already included science and technology and innovation in their development plan as a central strategy. The Philippines have failed to do this. Our country did not invest in sufficient resources in science and technology (S&amp;T) human resource development, research and development (R&amp;D), and physical infrastructure.</p><p>Because of this failure, our country has faced multiple if not many challenges through the years. These include the intensifying competition from globalization and regional integration, natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change, and persistent poverty and increasing inequality. </p><p>Our country and government must start including science and technology and innovations in their developmental plans and strategies. I strongly believe that we are competitive already but we will become even more competitive with these inclusions.  If no action is taken our country will continue to suffer and remain poor because of unresolved great damage from natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change.</p><p></p><p>#brainlyfast</p><br />
