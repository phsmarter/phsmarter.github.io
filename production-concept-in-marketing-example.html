                                            CASE STUDY Please answer briefly and concisely. The marketer has to learn about the needs and changing of the consumer behavior and practice the marketing concept. Levi Strauss and co. was selling jeans to a mass market and did not bother about segmenting the market till their sales went down. The study into consumer behavior showed their greatest market of the baby boomers had outgrown and their needs had changed. They therefore came out with khaki or Dockers to different segments and comfortable action stocks for the consumers in the 50 age group. Thus by separating the market and targeting various groups and fulfilling their needs, they not only made up for the lost sales but far exceeded the previous sales. They also targeted the women consumers for jeans and both men and women started wearing jeans in greater numbers. The offering given by the company must be enlarged to suit various segments. For example Maruti Udyog Ltd has come out with many models. Maruti 800, Maruti Van, Zen, Alto, Veagon R, Versa Gypsy, Esteem, Boleno and other models. For successful marketing one should: 1.Find consumer needs of various segments.  2.Position products(new and existing) to these segments  3.Develop strategies for these segments. Practice greater selectivity in advertising and personal selling and creating more selective media and distribution outlets. 1​</a>

                            4. CASE STUDY Please answer briefly and concisely. The marketer has to learn about the needs and changing of the consumer behavior and practice the marketing concept. Levi Strauss and co. was selling jeans to a mass market and did not bother about segmenting the market till their sales went down. The study into consumer behavior showed their greatest market of the baby boomers had outgrown and their needs had changed. They therefore came out with khaki or Dockers to different segments and comfortable action stocks for the consumers in the 50 age group. Thus by separating the market and targeting various groups and fulfilling their needs, they not only made up for the lost sales but far exceeded the previous sales. They also targeted the women consumers for jeans and both men and women started wearing jeans in greater numbers. The offering given by the company must be enlarged to suit various segments. For example Maruti Udyog Ltd has come out with many models. Maruti 800, Maruti Van, Zen, Alto, Veagon R, Versa Gypsy, Esteem, Boleno and other models. For successful marketing one should: 1.Find consumer needs of various segments.  2.Position products(new and existing) to these segments  3.Develop strategies for these segments. Practice greater selectivity in advertising and personal selling and creating more selective media and distribution outlets. 1​</h2><br />
