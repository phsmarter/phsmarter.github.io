                            1. Write an essay about the topic, "My Dream Profession" in relation to the topic Persons and Careers. Be creative and express your ideas with relation to the lesson.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>My ambition</p><p></p><p>Ever since I was very young and saw perhaps a child cut and bleeding or an old woman suffering from an incurable disease, I have always hated pain and the human suffering that it causes. It has, therefore, always been my ambition to become a doctor and to be able to cure diseases and to ease pain. Many count riches, power and glory among their ambitions, but for me, to serve humanity through medicine is the highest ambition of all.</p><p></p><p>The training is long and expensive and I shall need to work very hard. After passing the right examinations in school. I shall then need to take a University examination, which will enable me to enter the medical school, which is part of our University life in Singapore.</p><p></p><p>At University, there will be many lectures to attend. Physiology and Anatomy are two of the most important subjects during the first year. The different organs of the body such as the heart, the kidneys and the liver, together with their functions and disorders have to be studied. As well as this, there will be lectures on the many different diseases to which man is subject, with the various ways of diagnosing them and dealing with them. Lectures are given by highly qualified specialists.</p><p></p><p>As well as this theoretical work, there will be a practical course during the five years training. A new medical student has to begin by 'walking the wards' in a hospital. He accompanies doctors in charge of patients and watches what they do. He has to study patients being examined and listen tot he conclusions reached. he has intricate operations being performed by skilled surgeons. He had to make his own reports from his own diagnoses, at the same time, as the qualified doctor. All of these are checked and corrected, so that the student can learn from his mistakes. When he has passed this practical course, which lasts for about four years, he is then called a 'House man'.</p><p></p><p>Written examinations are taken at different stages. At the end of the first year, there is the first M.B. This is the first part of a Bachelor of Medicine degree and is a very difficult hurdle. Many students fail it. Then, there is the second M.B. and at the end 'finals' which include both a written, and oral and a practical examination. When 'finals' are safely behind me, I will really by a qualified doctor and be able to add this style to my name.</p><p></p><p>It will then be my ambition to obtain a grant from the authorities to travel abroad for further studies and I would like to go to Australia to do this. At a post-graduate course there, I would be able to study different methods, to see new techniques and to obtain even higher qualifications like a Doctor of Medicine degree.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I would return to Malaysia where I want to work as an assistant medical officer in one of our busiest cities. There, I would gain more practical experience than I ever could in a small village. All types of illness would, among a large population, most certainly come my way. The ailments of children, of young mothers and of the very old could all be studied. I would learn to recognize an appendicitis of tonsillitis very quickly. In a very large city, it is not always possible to have the services of a gynaecologist and so I would have practice in delivering babies myself.</p><p></p><p>During this time, I would try to save money. Doctors are rightly well-paid and I would live moderately. After some years, therefore, I hope to be not only experienced as a general practitioner, but also comfortably rich as well.</p><p></p><p>Finally, then I would realize my ultimate ambition, which is to do the medical practice in my own village and to return here. I have never had any desire to specialize and to become a pathologist, a surgeon, a gynecologist or an ear, nose and throat specialist. To be a good general practitioner here, in my own home is the end of my dream and, although not a specialist in any particular sphere, I shall know enough to deal with the common ailments of life and to call in the right specialists a once if they are needed. I shall then be able to serve the village I love so well.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Passing high school is crucial, what to do next – is even more critical. Making a right career choice involves a lot of thinking as you have to analyze various majors and right colleges. Today, most of the students are forced to opt for a career according to the choice of their parents.<br /><br />Parents are the major influential factor in the career development of a child.<br /><br />The world is changing, and the dreams of each teen change accordingly. Children should choose their career path and live their dreams. However, the real world experience of parents definitely cannot be put on a back seat. So, who should be the one choosing a career for a child — the child himself, parents or both together?<br /><br />If parents choose their child’s career, they will be more supportive of their child’s future. Many parents who have failed their past career goals set them on their children, and seem to relive their aspirations in their child. The parent then does as much as they can to make sure that their child lives the life they wish they could live by overspending on opportunities to ensure success with that career. <br />Adding on, parents have more experience in the world than their child, and therefore have a better understanding of the right and wrong decisions for career paths. In a parent’s perspective, a child could possibly end up making a bad decision for their future. The parent could act as a guide to make sure that their child makes good life decisions and doesn’t set unrealistic goals for themselves.<br />However, although parents seem to know everything that will lead to a successful future, the opposite may be true. Children know themselves better than anyone else, including their parents. By choosing their own career paths, children are setting themselves up for a future that they are interested in. Instead of living a monotonous life, they will be enjoying whatever career they choose based on their interests.<br />Furthermore, children have the right to choose what they want to achieve in the future. Every child has their dream career, and it is up to them if they want to follow their career dreams or not.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Basically, I want to become a lawyer because I believe that it is a good way of rendering service to society and that it will fully develop in me skills, abilities, and attitudes that I can apply in a lot of aspects of my life. I believe that the law profession plays an integral role in any community as it is generally works to analyze and solve legal theories and ensure that justice is enforced. In this regard, I want to be involved in that kind of profession while at the same time ensuring my professional growth.<p></p>For me, the interesting characteristics that a lawyer possesses are his or her wit, boldness, and audacity. In general, a lawyer exudes confidence and integrity while doing his or her job because this creates an aura of authority and professionalism around him. A lawyer must also be in total control of his or her emotions at all times especially during intense moments in court. In addition, it is notable that he or she works well under pressure, which is something I would like to emulate and apply in various situations in my life. In this regard, I want to have the same kind of confidence and calmness and possess unparalleled analytical and critical skills because this would no doubt aid me in several aspects of my life. I also believe that at present, I possess all of these traits and this is why I am convinced that the law profession is for me.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I want to be an entrepreneur. I want to have my own business. I want to be my own boss. These phrases are so easy to say, but for many it ends there. More often than not, entrepreneurial dreams remain just that, a dream.

                            26. Essay about Career talk​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each and every one of us has faced a certain junction or a cross-road at some point in our lives that has had a major impact on our lives. This can be both a professional crossroads or personal crossroads. But in this essay on career, I would like to talk about the cross-road that we see in our professional career. It’s not just the students who would have faced a dilemma in deciding a career, even employees past 30 years of age face this crisis.</p><p>When a student’s face its called a beginner’s crisis, but when an employee 6 years down the lane faces dilemmas in his or her career choices, then its usually called a mid-life crisis or mid-career crisis. Midlife crisis is a term that refers to people who are having second thoughts about their career a few years down after working in the same. There might be plenty of reasons for these some of which may be an everyday monologue, fatigue, salary issues, professional growth issues, internal office dilemmas, etc. In this essay on career, I am going to talk about both the type of career choices.</p><p></p><p>A student’s life is the first crossroad that we face in our lives. By keeping certain factors in mind, there is plenty of career choice a student can choose from. Some of the popular career choices are engineering, medicine, arts, and commerce. Which career to choose and on what terms is something that every student will have to worry about. There are certain criteria to choose a career, which are:</p><p></p>Passion: The word passion sounds cliche, but it is an important criterion to consider before choosing a career path. If everyone follows their passion and chose a career accordingly, then the concept of a mid-career crisis wouldn’t have occurred in the first place. Every one of us would have dreamt of something during our childhood. We all wanted to become a police, a cricketer, an actor, a doctor or an engineer. But not everyone follows and listens to the child in them. We ultimately give up on our passions and choose a safe career which will give us a good salary. Risk-taking is a part and parcel of life and no one should regret not doing something 80 years down the lane when they are on their death bed.Stability: Financial stability, as well as job stability, is something that should be considered as an important criterion. Because the world is increasingly changing and many industries are being taken out by emerging technologies. So before choosing a particular career path, the stability as the well the salary factors should be taken into accountFuture prospects: Future prospects, both in terms of your interest in the field as well the survival of the field itself, in the next 20 years should be taken into consideration. A Mid-career crisis can be avoided if future prospects are evaluated properly. Certain industries might fall and certain might become the next biggest phenomenon. People who are serious about their careers choose a path which has a long-lasting prospectSatisfaction: This is another important factor while choosing a career path. A good salary, a nice work environment and a good location might give some people the job satisfaction they need, but there are some people who are not affected by any of that. The only thing that matters to them is the job itself. Usually, a job that is socially helpful is the ones that provide true satisfaction.<p></p><br />

A worldview is a way in which we see the world and the people around us. A worldview is like looking through glasses because a person’s worldview clarifies the way, in which they view people and the world around them. A person’s worldview is the foundational element that guides their decision-making. Worldviews are a set of presuppositions that are different from person to person, but are crucial to understand because they provide the basis for our decision-making. As a Christian there are certain elements that should be contained in a Christian worldview. (105)</p><p></p><p>A Christian worldview starts with the belief that God exists.

That does not mean that I am looking for a pastor to be president, but rather that I look at what presidential candidate’s beliefs are and check their beliefs against the Bible. Voting for a candidate that aligns pretty close with what Christians believe is best because that means the candidate will do their best to run the country to honor God. Another key area that my worldview should influence is my future career because whatever I decide to do, I should have the mindset to honor and serve God with my career. As of right now, my future plans are to become a counselor and that aligns with my beliefs because I know that there are many people that are hurting in this world. Those hurting people need encouragement, but they also need to know that God is always there for them.

As I began my career planning in High school the realization of how long it would take to become a doctor discouraged me. I once again changed my career goals to becoming a teacher, and then finally to a nurse who could assist with the delivery of babies. Making the right choice was important to me and that explains the ever changing career decisions. After doing some research I decided that a nurse midwife was along the lines of where I want to be. Completing this the personal career development plan will not only help me see my goals on paper but will give me something to look back on when I have acquired all the goals I set to accomplish.</p><br />
