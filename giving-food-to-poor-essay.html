Directions: Read and study carefully the given excerpt. Use the organizer below.
We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the
pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members
of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via
instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our
different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by
extension, our vulnerability to epidemics
COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people
across every state in the United States and its four territories had te sted positive for COVID-19 According
to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United
States However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture, a closer look at data by different
social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been
disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right
to health fulfilled
The Disproportional Impact of COVID-19 on African Americans
Volume 22/2, December 2020, pp 299-307
Mantza Vasquez Reyes
According to the World Health Organization's report Closing Gap in a Generation Health Equity
through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, "poor and unequal living conditions are the
consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion he way societies are organized-poor
social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics. This toxic combination of
factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news cn the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States I recognize
that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does
not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.

It has too much fat, sugar and carbohydrates that do not give us the energy we need throughout the day. Fast food is tasty, but is it really good for you? People must avoid eating fast food as it provides very little nutrition, slowly makes one fat and eventually causes many health problems. Also, eating fast food can make a person become fat and obese overtime. Most fast food is deep fried in oil and has many calories. Finally, being on a fast food diet can lead to poor health.

We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the
pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members
of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via
instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our
different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by
extension, our vulnerability to epidemics
COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people
across every state in the United States and its four territories had te sted positive for COVID-19 According
to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United
States However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture, a closer look at data by different
social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been
disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right
to health fulfilled
The Disproportional Impact of COVID-19 on African Americans
Volume 22/2, December 2020, pp 299-307
Mantza Vasquez Reyes
According to the World Health Organization's report Closing Gap in a Generation Health Equity
through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, "poor and unequal living conditions are the
consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion he way societies are organized-poor
social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics. This toxic combination of
factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news cn the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States I recognize
that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does
not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.
