These came amid the reported scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPEs) in hospitals.Likewise, groups and individuals are seeking support to fund relief goods for the families that are in need of food and personal hygiene kits, as major cities and provinces and provinces impose in their own community quarantine protocols.There are hundreds of more donations drives that are hundreds of more donations that are happening across the Philippines today, signaling the strong revival of the Filipino culture of Bayanihan—only that with the strict implementation of community quarantines and social distancing protocols, donations are facilitated through mobile phones.Source: globalnation.inquirer.net (posted March 2019) Questions:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The major consequences of globalization have been: the transmogrification of traditional religions and belief systems; the beginning of the disintegration of the traditional social fabrics and shared norms by consumerism, cyber-culture, newfangled religions and changing work ethics and work rhythms; the fast spreading.Bringing together a flexible labor market, increased trading opportunities, and enhanced communication systems, more countries can now participate in the international market. ... Globalization gives more opportunities to countries who may not have been able to enter the international market on their own.An individual's cultural participation influences how she behaves toward others in society, and their cultural participation influences how they treat her. Culture permeates social, economic, and political action. ... As a result, society is more democratic and so, by definition, better at meeting its citizens' needs.Globalization also influences our cultural identity and affinity groups. Technology allows us to eliminate communication boundaries and interact with each other on a global scale. Globalization lends itself to cultural homogenization that is the world becoming culturally similar.<br />

These came amid the reported scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPEs) in hospitals.Likewise, groups and individuals are seeking support to fund relief goods for the families that are in need of food and personal hygiene kits, as major cities and provinces and provinces impose in their own community quarantine protocols.There are hundreds of more donations drives that are hundreds of more donations that are happening across the Philippines today, signaling the strong revival of the Filipino culture of Bayanihan—only that with the strict implementation of community quarantines and social distancing protocols, donations are facilitated through mobile phones.Source: globalnation.inquirer.net (posted March 2019) Questions:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Global culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a group or society that spans across the globe. With the advancements in technology, communication, and transportation, the world has become more interconnected, and global culture has emerged. It encompasses various aspects of human life, such as language, art, music, food, fashion, and sports, among others. Global culture has also brought about cultural diffusion, whereby different cultures interact and share their practices, resulting in new hybrid cultures.</p><p>Tourism geography, on the other hand, refers to the study of the geographical distribution and patterns of tourism, including its social, economic, and environmental impacts. The tourism industry has grown significantly over the years, and it has become a crucial part of many countries' economies. It involves people traveling to different destinations for leisure, business, or other purposes. Tourism geography helps to understand the factors that influence tourist behavior, such as the natural attractions, cultural heritage, infrastructure, and transportation networks of different destinations.</p><p>Global culture and tourism geography are intertwined. Global culture has contributed to the growth of the tourism industry by creating a demand for travel and exploration of different cultures. People travel to experience new cultures, taste different foods, and witness diverse lifestyles. Tourism, in turn, has also influenced global culture by promoting the exchange of ideas, customs, and traditions between different societies. Global culture and tourism geography continue to evolve, driven by the changing preferences of tourists and the constant exchange of cultural practices.</p><br />
