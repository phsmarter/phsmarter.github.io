ITO PO UNG ARTICLE The rigid mothodology in recent COVID-19 vaccinations istruly praiseworthy. VWe seo whole of syslem, wholo of governmentand whole of society approaches covering overy aspoct from arivalof vaccines to deployment to LGUs nationwide. This includes maslerprofiling of each eligible candidate for vaccination, caroful selection ofvaccinators, strict injection prolocols, and adverse roactionsmonitoning and evaluation.As of Monday, government says 29,266 of the total 2million medical front liners have been vaccinated nationwide. So farwe received a donation of 600,000 doses from China's Sinovac,while 525,000 doses of AstraZeneca had been delivered through theCOVAX facility of the World Health Organization. Another 1.4 milliondoses of Sinovac will arrive on March 21 under a government supplyagreement.Actually, the sight of "efficient" and fully networked "massvaccinations today of Sinovac and AstraZeneca brings back ournation's horrible experience with the 2016 school-based massvaccinaton by then DOH-DEPED of a similar "under clinicaltrials" Dengvaxia vaccine to 833,000 elementary students.On hindsight, the Dengvaxia anti-dengue vaccine was notthe mistake since it was finally approved for permanent use by theregulatory agencies of US, European Union and 19 other countries in2018.In the April 2016 school-based vaccinations, there were nopre-injection processing of students to determine if they have existingmedical conditons or co-morbidities. Even "vaccinators" were notcarefuly selected and there was no monitoring of adverse reactionsof inoculated students. Finally, there was no master list of the totalnumber of inoculated students in both DEPED and DOH.Because of this, there had been reports of elementarystudents who died allegedly after geting the first dose in August2016. In the ensuing Senate investigation, an officer of SanofPharmaceuticals even "apologized" for exposing the children to apossible "severe disease."Clearly, it was the nushed and haphazad vaccination ofDengvaxa by the paat Aquino administraton that created the cha0sthe exact opposite of today's DOH vaccinations The big questionstll ingers, why did the oulgoing Aquino adminisiralion launch theirschool-based Dengvaxia vaccination, wilth only two monlh beforethey left office in 2016?COVID-19 situation in PHAs government speeds up vaccination of 1.7 million medical frontiners nationwide, it is necessary to inform everyone on how ourcountry's COVID-19 situation compares worldwide in terms of casesand deaths per 1-nillion population.I think we are doing groat, despite nogative/alarmist news,according to the latest worldometer.com info website. We are number129 out of 219 countries worldwide with only 5,376 total cases perour 1-million population. In ASEAN, we are third to Singapore whichleads with 10,207 cases per million while Malaysia is second with9,601 cases per million. Indonesia is close fourth with 5,008 casesper million with Sri Lanka fifth at 3,991 per million.Rich and medically advanced countries such as USA is atnumber 8 (89,359), Spain at number 19 (67,334) Switzerland atnumber 23 (64,648), UK at number 25 (61,919) and France atnumber 27 (59,723).In terms of deaths per million, we are at number 118 out of 219countries with only 113 deaths per 1-million population. Indonesialeads ASEAN with 135 deaths while Malaysia has 36 deaths, SriLanka, 23 deaths and Singapore at 5 deaths per 1-million.United Kingdom is at number 6 worldwide (1,827 deaths), Italy isnumber 8 (1,652 deaths), USA at number 11 (1,618 deaths), Spanat number 15 (1,521) and Mexico at number 16 (1,468 deaths permillion)These numbers speak the truth that since the pandemic outbre=last year, and whether there was a surge or spike happening, ourcountry is still in a far better situation than others in this planet.​</a>

Read the selection below and find out how you can analyze and interpret literary text using Marxist Criticism. What is Marxist Criticism / Marxism? - A type of literary criticism based on the writings of German philosopher Karl Marx. It is a critical approach to literature which shows the relationship between literature and the social-mainly economic-conditions under which it was produced. Originally, Manist critics focused on literary representations of workers and working classes. For later Manxists, however, literature became a document of a kind of knowledge and a record of the historical conditions that produced that knowfedge. Like cultural criticism, Marxist literary criticism offers critiques of the "canon and focuses on the ways in which culture and power intersect; for a Marxist critic, literature both reproduces existing power relations and offers a space where they can be contested and redefined. Important 20th-century Marxist literary critics include Georg Lucaks. Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Teny Eagleton, Raymond Williams, and Frederic Jameson.

ITO PO UNG ARTICLE The rigid mothodology in recent COVID-19 vaccinations istruly praiseworthy. VWe seo whole of syslem, wholo of governmentand whole of society approaches covering overy aspoct from arivalof vaccines to deployment to LGUs nationwide. This includes maslerprofiling of each eligible candidate for vaccination, caroful selection ofvaccinators, strict injection prolocols, and adverse roactionsmonitoning and evaluation.As of Monday, government says 29,266 of the total 2million medical front liners have been vaccinated nationwide. So farwe received a donation of 600,000 doses from China's Sinovac,while 525,000 doses of AstraZeneca had been delivered through theCOVAX facility of the World Health Organization. Another 1.4 milliondoses of Sinovac will arrive on March 21 under a government supplyagreement.Actually, the sight of "efficient" and fully networked "massvaccinations today of Sinovac and AstraZeneca brings back ournation's horrible experience with the 2016 school-based massvaccinaton by then DOH-DEPED of a similar "under clinicaltrials" Dengvaxia vaccine to 833,000 elementary students.On hindsight, the Dengvaxia anti-dengue vaccine was notthe mistake since it was finally approved for permanent use by theregulatory agencies of US, European Union and 19 other countries in2018.In the April 2016 school-based vaccinations, there were nopre-injection processing of students to determine if they have existingmedical conditons or co-morbidities. Even "vaccinators" were notcarefuly selected and there was no monitoring of adverse reactionsof inoculated students. Finally, there was no master list of the totalnumber of inoculated students in both DEPED and DOH.Because of this, there had been reports of elementarystudents who died allegedly after geting the first dose in August2016. In the ensuing Senate investigation, an officer of SanofPharmaceuticals even "apologized" for exposing the children to apossible "severe disease."Clearly, it was the nushed and haphazad vaccination ofDengvaxa by the paat Aquino administraton that created the cha0sthe exact opposite of today's DOH vaccinations The big questionstll ingers, why did the oulgoing Aquino adminisiralion launch theirschool-based Dengvaxia vaccination, wilth only two monlh beforethey left office in 2016?COVID-19 situation in PHAs government speeds up vaccination of 1.7 million medical frontiners nationwide, it is necessary to inform everyone on how ourcountry's COVID-19 situation compares worldwide in terms of casesand deaths per 1-nillion population.I think we are doing groat, despite nogative/alarmist news,according to the latest worldometer.com info website. We are number129 out of 219 countries worldwide with only 5,376 total cases perour 1-million population. In ASEAN, we are third to Singapore whichleads with 10,207 cases per million while Malaysia is second with9,601 cases per million. Indonesia is close fourth with 5,008 casesper million with Sri Lanka fifth at 3,991 per million.Rich and medically advanced countries such as USA is atnumber 8 (89,359), Spain at number 19 (67,334) Switzerland atnumber 23 (64,648), UK at number 25 (61,919) and France atnumber 27 (59,723).In terms of deaths per million, we are at number 118 out of 219countries with only 113 deaths per 1-million population. Indonesialeads ASEAN with 135 deaths while Malaysia has 36 deaths, SriLanka, 23 deaths and Singapore at 5 deaths per 1-million.United Kingdom is at number 6 worldwide (1,827 deaths), Italy isnumber 8 (1,652 deaths), USA at number 11 (1,618 deaths), Spanat number 15 (1,521) and Mexico at number 16 (1,468 deaths permillion)These numbers speak the truth that since the pandemic outbre=last year, and whether there was a surge or spike happening, ourcountry is still in a far better situation than others in this planet.​</h2><br />
