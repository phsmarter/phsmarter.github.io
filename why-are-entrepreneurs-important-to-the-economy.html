Hard Questions
Entrepreneurs Answer for Society
• WHAT IS TO BE PRODUCED?
Since two-thirds of the total production of goods and services focus on the consumer sector, consumers comprise the group who determines what is to be produced.
• FOR WHOM IS IT TO BE PRODUCED?
In the economy, the “For Whom” question is generally defined as whoever has the most money to buy the items which are made from the factors of production. Generally speaking, the people with the most money are those who own a successful business (consumers want their goods and services) and/or those who are in occupations in high demand (businesses want their skills).
• HOW WILL IT BE PRODUCED?
This is determined with the consumer in mind, primarily through the interaction of businesses and consumers. For example, the Rolls Royce is a luxurious car made with high expenses and lasts a long time. Many consumers however cannot afford a Rolls Royce. Entrepreneurs note this point and produce less exclusive cars at a lower price in order to satisfy the needs and wants of those who cannot afford a Rolls.
In addressing these questions, it is important to point out how the market operates in each one. For example, if consumers do not buy certain items which are produced, this is a signal to business to stop producing them (what is to be produced). If consumers will not pay the price for an item even though it is of high quality, producers might have to find ways to use other technologies for the item in order to make it less expensive (how to produce). Those people who choose to enter occupations or establish businesses which produce goods and services that are in big demand will get more of the output (for whom).</a>

                                            actually depends on the particular definition you are using.Luminosity is a star’s energy output per second. It does not depend on the distance to the star. Loosely speaking, luminosity is how “bright” a star really is. However, brightness has three different meanings in astronomy, as follows:a) Brightness can mean the same as luminosity, in which case it should really be referred to as intrinsic brightness.b) The second meaning is more correctly referred to as apparent brightness. It is the light energy per second per unit area detected by an observer. It is also called the star’s flux. The distance to the star is important in this case.c) Thirdly, apparent brightness can simply be another way of referring to a star’s apparent magnitude (see the Footnote below for more on apparent magnitude).Despite the detrimental impact on economies around the world, the pandemic may have been more of a game of winners and losers than some had previously assumed. Changes in customer demand, surges in online shopping and incentivised opportunities for entrepreneurs presented a more favourable business landscape for start-ups in certain industries compared to more established companies which were unable to adapt to the changing times.Undoubtedly, COVID-19 challenged businesses in more ways than one. Companies all over the world were forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviours and restructure their approach to business almost overnight. While this transformation seems to have left some behind, it is the tech-savvy, younger generation of entrepreneurs who have not only survived, but thrived as a result. You may be wondering why?Digital First ApproachOngoing lockdowns and the move to working from home resulted in a greater reliance on technology in almost every aspect of our lives, and, for a number of start-ups, this presented an opportunity for growth. Companies without the structures in place to support remote work will have felt the impact almost immediately, while newer start-ups that were more accustomed to the digital world were able to quickly adapt to the new economic environment.Similarly, businesses without an online presence would have struggled following the shift to online shopping while several EdTech, pharma and fashion e-tailer start-ups benefitted from robust digital marketing strategies, cementing themselves in hyperlocal trade and door-to-door deliveries. The crisis also became an unexpected catalyst for growth for certain industries such as delivery services, commercial cleaning and online fitness and wellness programmes that may have been previously overlooked by the average consumer.​</a>

Hard Questions
Entrepreneurs Answer for Society
• WHAT IS TO BE PRODUCED?
Since two-thirds of the total production of goods and services focus on the consumer sector, consumers comprise the group who determines what is to be produced.
• FOR WHOM IS IT TO BE PRODUCED?
In the economy, the “For Whom” question is generally defined as whoever has the most money to buy the items which are made from the factors of production. Generally speaking, the people with the most money are those who own a successful business (consumers want their goods and services) and/or those who are in occupations in high demand (businesses want their skills).
• HOW WILL IT BE PRODUCED?
This is determined with the consumer in mind, primarily through the interaction of businesses and consumers. For example, the Rolls Royce is a luxurious car made with high expenses and lasts a long time. Many consumers however cannot afford a Rolls Royce. Entrepreneurs note this point and produce less exclusive cars at a lower price in order to satisfy the needs and wants of those who cannot afford a Rolls.
In addressing these questions, it is important to point out how the market operates in each one. For example, if consumers do not buy certain items which are produced, this is a signal to business to stop producing them (what is to be produced). If consumers will not pay the price for an item even though it is of high quality, producers might have to find ways to use other technologies for the item in order to make it less expensive (how to produce). Those people who choose to enter occupations or establish businesses which produce goods and services that are in big demand will get more of the output (for whom).</h2><br />

Entrepreneurs consider factors such as cost and consumer demand in order to produce goods and services that satisfy the needs and wants of consumers.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            15. actually depends on the particular definition you are using.Luminosity is a star’s energy output per second. It does not depend on the distance to the star. Loosely speaking, luminosity is how “bright” a star really is. However, brightness has three different meanings in astronomy, as follows:a) Brightness can mean the same as luminosity, in which case it should really be referred to as intrinsic brightness.b) The second meaning is more correctly referred to as apparent brightness. It is the light energy per second per unit area detected by an observer. It is also called the star’s flux. The distance to the star is important in this case.c) Thirdly, apparent brightness can simply be another way of referring to a star’s apparent magnitude (see the Footnote below for more on apparent magnitude).Despite the detrimental impact on economies around the world, the pandemic may have been more of a game of winners and losers than some had previously assumed. Changes in customer demand, surges in online shopping and incentivised opportunities for entrepreneurs presented a more favourable business landscape for start-ups in certain industries compared to more established companies which were unable to adapt to the changing times.Undoubtedly, COVID-19 challenged businesses in more ways than one. Companies all over the world were forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviours and restructure their approach to business almost overnight. While this transformation seems to have left some behind, it is the tech-savvy, younger generation of entrepreneurs who have not only survived, but thrived as a result. You may be wondering why?Digital First ApproachOngoing lockdowns and the move to working from home resulted in a greater reliance on technology in almost every aspect of our lives, and, for a number of start-ups, this presented an opportunity for growth. Companies without the structures in place to support remote work will have felt the impact almost immediately, while newer start-ups that were more accustomed to the digital world were able to quickly adapt to the new economic environment.Similarly, businesses without an online presence would have struggled following the shift to online shopping while several EdTech, pharma and fashion e-tailer start-ups benefitted from robust digital marketing strategies, cementing themselves in hyperlocal trade and door-to-door deliveries. The crisis also became an unexpected catalyst for growth for certain industries such as delivery services, commercial cleaning and online fitness and wellness programmes that may have been previously overlooked by the average consumer.​</h2><br />
