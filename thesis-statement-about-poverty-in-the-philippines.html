The new normal is rather at least better than ECQ which caused a lot of people to get depressed and suicide due to depression.

                        <p>People experience <strong>hunger because of poverty</strong>. An <strong>issue of every third world country </strong>that is so hard to resolve. Is it the government’s fault why a lot of people in our country experience this? It could be one of the reasons. When there’s corruption, there’s poverty. How expensive it is to provide to the poorest people? </p><p>In reality, if you are rich, you could be richer. If you work for the rich, you could be their worker for a lifetime. Sad, because it seems like the society is not allowing change and growth to those who are worth it. Filipinos are hardworking. It is our innate personality. However, opportunities are not given to all. Not everyone can attain the highest education. Remote areas are lacking of schools and teachers. The local government must pursue that all children must experience education because it is a necessity. </p><p><strong>Poverty is experienced globally</strong>. It is said that 1 billion children worldwide are living in poverty, and according to <strong>UNICEF</strong>, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty. Filipinos contribute to that number. Children die because of extreme <strong>hunger, malnutrition or dehydration</strong> because some couldn’t even afford to drink clean water. I really hope the government could really help these people by giving them sources of income, like in agriculture or fishery. I also thought that if the government could do something about the infrastructures and electricity of these remotes areas so that there will be more educators and doctors who could visit their places. All of us should work together in order to achieve a proper living. A proper living where every one in the family could eat three times a day, a house that could protect them day and night, an education for the young ones, and accessible health centers. </p><p>It sounded easy, but it really is so hard to do. Because if it was easy, our country will not be experiencing this issue anymore. I just hope everyone can be given a chance to live in this world where everyone would feel contented.</p><p>Read more about poverty and hunger:</p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1350833</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/473646</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/464802</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Depends where in the Philippines you are. Much of the country experiences heavy rains and lots of typhoons every year, so flooding is practically guaranteed. Whether it’s destructive or not depends on several reasons. If you’re in Manila, congestion and geography are the main reasons. Manila has always been prone to flood. It’s low-lying and the drainage is not good (there used to be canals and channels - called esteros, but they’ve either been built over or have been backed up with garbage) - plus a lot of it is paved over so there’s no ground absorption. Also everything drains to only one place, Manila Bay, via flood drains (which are inevitably clogged with garbage) or the Pasig River, which itself floods. Outside Manila, heavy rainfalls turn into disastrous and destructive floods and landslides (or mudslides) because of deforested hills and mountains.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainlies po please </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippine Statistics Authority updates the 2018 Full Year Official Poverty Statistics, which was initially released last 06 December 20191. This is in relation with the availability of the final 2018 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), as noted from PR 2020-093. The final 2018 FIES now incorporates the updated urban-rural classification based on the results of the 2015 Census of Population, and some revisions in the average family size as a result of the validations done when the merged 2018 FIES and the January 2019 Labor Force Survey (LFS) became available. Likewise, the updated urban-rural classification was adopted in the 2015 FIES to generate the 2015 Official Poverty Statistics that is comparable with the 2018 estimates.  Hence, the 2015 estimates also released in December 2019 were also updated2.</p><p></p><p>As a result of the updating, the 2018 poverty incidence among population, or the proportion of poor Filipinos whose per capita income is insufficient to meet their basic food and non-food needs, is now estimated at 16.7 percent (from 16.6/P percent). This translates to about 17.7 million Filipinos living in poverty in 2018 (from 17.6/P million Filipinos).  On the other hand, subsistence incidence among population in 2018 remains at 5.2 percent after updating</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA RATE</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Even though the Philippines has an improved economy today, the majority of the people living there are still struggling in poverty.
</p><p>People living in the Philippines are not enjoying the equal distribution of wealth, once they become poor, they will become so very poor, once they become rich, they will become so very rich.
</p><p>What is poverty? Economically, poverty happened when people do not meet all of their basic needs, they don’t meet the basic requirements to live better.
</p><p>It is the state that a person has little or no money at all or few or no material possessions.
</p><p>These people encountered struggles in life and probably cannot eat every day or every meal, can’t afford to buy clothes as protection to their body.
</p><p>They have no shelter to live in. Poverty is visible in how do people live and how much money they have.
</p><p>Not all people do not understand the true meaning of poverty, some people are not aware of the condition.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
