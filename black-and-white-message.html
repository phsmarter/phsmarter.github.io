I've been on the Mountaintop by: Dr. Martin Luther The world is changing and anyone who thinks he can live alone in this world is sleeping through a revolution... We must learn to live together as brothers or we shall perish together as fools. Racial injustice is still the black man's burden and the white man's shame. The government must certainly share the guilt, the individual must share the guilt, and even the church must share the guilt. I have been receiving threats on my life...or warnings about what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers. I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop, and I no longer mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life; longevity has its grace. But I am not concemed about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He has allowed me to go up to the mountain." And I've looked over, sand I've seen the promised land." I may not get there with you, but I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to that promised land.: I am not worried about anything. I am not fearing any man.

Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receiveComfort in morning joy in the noonday.And we are put on earth a little space,That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt faceIs but a cloud, and like a shady grove.For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care,And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,And be like him and he will then love me.​</a>

                                            PENGUINS ANTICS
Penguins are birds that live in the coldest parts of the world. They are black with a white stomach and have small wings. They move across the ice by wadding slowly on their little feet with their wings. They move across the ice by waddling slowly on their feet without to the side. Surprisingly, Penguins cannot fly even though they have wings. They use their wings to balance them as they waddle across the ice. Their bodies are also very good at keeping the penguin 
warm in the cold weather. Penguins are very good at swimming and use the strength in their bodies to move easily through the water. Penguins need to be good swimmers because they eat mostly fish and sea animals. When they catch their food they swallow it whole! They also need to use their strong bodies to get away from seals and sharks because seals and sharks eat penguins. There are lots of different types of penguins and they come in all different sizes and shapes. We all need to make sure we take good care of our world because oil spills and global warming can destroy the penguin’s home.

I've been on the Mountaintop by: Dr. Martin Luther The world is changing and anyone who thinks he can live alone in this world is sleeping through a revolution... We must learn to live together as brothers or we shall perish together as fools. Racial injustice is still the black man's burden and the white man's shame. The government must certainly share the guilt, the individual must share the guilt, and even the church must share the guilt. I have been receiving threats on my life...or warnings about what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers. I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop, and I no longer mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life; longevity has its grace. But I am not concemed about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He has allowed me to go up to the mountain." And I've looked over, sand I've seen the promised land." I may not get there with you, but I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to that promised land.: I am not worried about anything. I am not fearing any man.

Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receiveComfort in morning joy in the noonday.And we are put on earth a little space,That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt faceIs but a cloud, and like a shady grove.For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care,And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,And be like him and he will then love me.​</h2><br />

                            30. PENGUINS ANTICS
Penguins are birds that live in the coldest parts of the world. They are black with a white stomach and have small wings. They move across the ice by wadding slowly on their little feet with their wings. They move across the ice by waddling slowly on their feet without to the side. Surprisingly, Penguins cannot fly even though they have wings. They use their wings to balance them as they waddle across the ice. Their bodies are also very good at keeping the penguin 
warm in the cold weather. Penguins are very good at swimming and use the strength in their bodies to move easily through the water. Penguins need to be good swimmers because they eat mostly fish and sea animals. When they catch their food they swallow it whole! They also need to use their strong bodies to get away from seals and sharks because seals and sharks eat penguins. There are lots of different types of penguins and they come in all different sizes and shapes. We all need to make sure we take good care of our world because oil spills and global warming can destroy the penguin’s home.
