                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Balancing a Chemical Equation</strong></p><p>Because the identities of the reactants and products are fixed, the equation cannot be balanced by changing the subscripts of the reactants or the products. To do so would change the chemical identity of the species being described, as illustrated in the picture..</p><p></p><p></p><p>Original molecule H2O: if the coefficient 2 is added in front, that makes 2 water molecules; but if the subscript 2 is added to make H2O2, that's hydrogen peroxide.  The simplest and most generally useful method for balancing chemical equations is “inspection,” better known as trial and error. The following is an efficient approach to balancing a chemical equation using this method.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Steps in Balancing a Chemical Equation</strong></p>
Identify the most complex substance.
Count the numbers of atoms of each kind on both sides of the equation to be sure that the chemical equation is balanced.Beginning with that substance, choose an element(s) that appears in only one reactant and one product, if possible. Adjust the coefficients to obtain the same number of atoms of this element(s) on both sides.
Balance polyatomic ions (if present on both sides of the chemical equation) as a unit.
Balance the remaining atoms, usually ending with the least complex substance and using fractional coefficients if necessary. If a fractional coefficient has been used, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to obtain whole numbers for the coefficients.
