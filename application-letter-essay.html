Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance. I am sure this is the correct career path as I grew up in a family where my father was a city councilor and my mother was a social worker. Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career. I have attached my transcript of records, application essay, letters of recommendation and other pertinent documents. Thank you for your time. and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, MEGAN REYES Answer the following questions based on the sample collegeadmission letter.1. What is the school's complete name?  2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An excellent resume has the power to open doors. Resume and Application Letter are the main requirements when applying on a job. It is the first thing in a company that will require you to bring because your personal info including your name and contacts is there and also your skills, achievements and experiences are written there. It is where the company are going to evaluate or observe you first before ypu take an interview, so your resume and application letter must be good and well written. It also help the employer to make a decision if they are going to hire you or not. The most important part of your resume is your skills, it shouldn't be long or in paragraph but you should write there your greatest skills that the employer are looking. It shouldn't be simple, it should be well written or professionally written. sole purpose is to land you an interview. A resume is to give your potential employer a feel for your past experience and skills.</p><p>A cover or a application letter is an important way to showcase how your unique combination of skills and experience meet the key requirements of the job description. It is your chance to show a clear link between your knowledge, experience and abilities and the needs of the employer. The cover letter allows you to target the job and the employer in a very specific way, leaving the resume to market your skills, qualities and experience as a part of the bigger picture. Your resume then needs less tweaking with each application because the letter, which must be different each time, does that for you. THE APPLICATION LETTER IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE RESUME. </p><br />
