                                            Aside from the spread of the infectious disease and the struggle to contain it, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic has created far-reaching implications, including economic, social, and cultural consequences. The said disease is anticipated to automatically affect the Philippine economy and the global economy as well, since deceleration or slowdown in economic activities, which is an infection control practice, is inevitably needed in preventing and reducing the transmission of the disease from one person to another. Decrease in tourist arrivals because of travel restrictions, sharp decline in remittances, increase in business closures, and rise in the unemployment rate are some of the expected economic impacts of the pandemic.Apart from the economic sectors, this infectious disease has also affected the different social institutions, such as education and family. Widespread closures of educational institutions and utilization of distance education instead of face-to-face learning are a few implications of the pandemic in the educational system. Also, people, especially women and children, have become more vulnerable to the different types of domestic and sexual violence because of community quarantine, which is sad, thinking that it should be safer for them to stay at home with their family. According to the Philippine National Police's - Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC), 602 cases of sexual assault, or an average of eight incidents a day, were recorded from March 17, 2020 to May 23, 2020. These were the times when Luzon and other parts of the Philippines were under enhanced community quarantine because of the pandemic. Religion is another social institution that is impacted by the pandemic. Sunday schools or church schools were closed, worship services of various religious institutions were cancelled, and even pilgrimages, or visitations to the places that are considered holy or special, were also cancelled.Because of these consequences brought by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, our world and our everyday lives will never go back to normal for a long period of time. Whether we like it or not, we must adapt the routines and restrictions of the “new normal,” such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, and changing our lifestyles, so that we can prevent the spread of the infectious disease and ensure not just our own safety, but the safety of all. Fortunately, various disciplines of Social Sciences can help us adjust to the “new normal.” These disciplines can help in the battle against the pandemic byinvestigating the different social forces related to the development and transmission of this infectious disease. Moreover, Social Science disciplines can produce knowledge that can be employed in helping individuals, families, and communities on how to better cope with the implications of the pandemic. Now, the question is: What are the different disciplines under the Social Sciences?Pahelp sana may matinong sumagot​</a>

                                            Who is the 17th President before his political career?Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos is the lone child of former First Lady Imelda Marcos and late President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. Before he entered politics, Bongbong Marcos led a happy life with his family, just like any other young person. He completed kindergarten at the Institucion Teresiana and elementary school at La Salle Green Hills in Manila before being sent to England to continue his secondary education at the Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine abbey, and to continue living a better life while his father was previously serving the Philippines.In addition, Bongbong Marcos wants to continue his education; he enrolled at Oxford University in England to complete his undergraduate degree with a Special Diploma in Social Studies; after that, he pursued a Masters in Business Administration at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA. He actually has a passion for music, and he frequently participated in all of his late father's projects and events. Bongbong never failed to carry on his father's legacy. He has the utmost respect for what his father accomplished in politics since he was able to see everything in between.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.With that said, it can be seen that Bongbong Marcos was very modest with other people, maintaining his manners, and instilling virtues like his late father even before he won the 2021 Presidential election. Bongbong Marcos represents the hope and resiliency that this nation needs, just like the windmills do. That is one of the factors that helps a country develop and achieve sustainable life.​</a>

Watch a special report from ABC News "White Supremacist Move Into Town", video is available in YouTube. This person's actions are consistent with his cultural belief that white people are superior. Would a cultural relativist be correct in maintaining that nobody has the moral basis to complain about the white supremacist's actions because he was just following what he believed was right?3. In the Philippines, one moral argument against RH Law is that it violates universal human rights and values such as the right to life and health of children. On the other hand, proponents of the law assert that family planning and sexual education consistent with one's own beliefs and moral convictions is exercising one's freedom to choose.

Deped Memorandum No. 44 and 45 are important because they provide guidelines for the implementation of the K-12 program in the Philippines. Deped Memorandum No. 44, which was issued in 2016, provides guidelines for the implementation of the senior high school program. This memorandum outlines the curriculum, assessment, and graduation requirements for senior high school students. Deped Memorandum No. 45, which was issued in 2015, provides guidelines for the implementation of the K-12 program in general. This memorandum outlines the curriculum, assessment, and other policies related to the K-12 program.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, Deped Memorandum No. 44 and 45 are important because they provide a framework for the implementation of the K-12 program. The K-12 program is a major reform in the Philippine education system, and it is important to have clear guidelines and policies to ensure its successful implementation. These memorandums provide a roadmap for schools and educators to follow, which can help to ensure that students receive a high-quality education that prepares them for college or the workforce.</p><p></p><br />

                            11. Aside from the spread of the infectious disease and the struggle to contain it, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic has created far-reaching implications, including economic, social, and cultural consequences. The said disease is anticipated to automatically affect the Philippine economy and the global economy as well, since deceleration or slowdown in economic activities, which is an infection control practice, is inevitably needed in preventing and reducing the transmission of the disease from one person to another. Decrease in tourist arrivals because of travel restrictions, sharp decline in remittances, increase in business closures, and rise in the unemployment rate are some of the expected economic impacts of the pandemic.Apart from the economic sectors, this infectious disease has also affected the different social institutions, such as education and family. Widespread closures of educational institutions and utilization of distance education instead of face-to-face learning are a few implications of the pandemic in the educational system. Also, people, especially women and children, have become more vulnerable to the different types of domestic and sexual violence because of community quarantine, which is sad, thinking that it should be safer for them to stay at home with their family. According to the Philippine National Police's - Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC), 602 cases of sexual assault, or an average of eight incidents a day, were recorded from March 17, 2020 to May 23, 2020. These were the times when Luzon and other parts of the Philippines were under enhanced community quarantine because of the pandemic. Religion is another social institution that is impacted by the pandemic. Sunday schools or church schools were closed, worship services of various religious institutions were cancelled, and even pilgrimages, or visitations to the places that are considered holy or special, were also cancelled.Because of these consequences brought by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, our world and our everyday lives will never go back to normal for a long period of time. Whether we like it or not, we must adapt the routines and restrictions of the “new normal,” such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, and changing our lifestyles, so that we can prevent the spread of the infectious disease and ensure not just our own safety, but the safety of all. Fortunately, various disciplines of Social Sciences can help us adjust to the “new normal.” These disciplines can help in the battle against the pandemic byinvestigating the different social forces related to the development and transmission of this infectious disease. Moreover, Social Science disciplines can produce knowledge that can be employed in helping individuals, families, and communities on how to better cope with the implications of the pandemic. Now, the question is: What are the different disciplines under the Social Sciences?Pahelp sana may matinong sumagot​</h2><br />

                            17. Who is the 17th President before his political career?Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos is the lone child of former First Lady Imelda Marcos and late President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. Before he entered politics, Bongbong Marcos led a happy life with his family, just like any other young person. He completed kindergarten at the Institucion Teresiana and elementary school at La Salle Green Hills in Manila before being sent to England to continue his secondary education at the Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine abbey, and to continue living a better life while his father was previously serving the Philippines.In addition, Bongbong Marcos wants to continue his education; he enrolled at Oxford University in England to complete his undergraduate degree with a Special Diploma in Social Studies; after that, he pursued a Masters in Business Administration at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA. He actually has a passion for music, and he frequently participated in all of his late father's projects and events. Bongbong never failed to carry on his father's legacy. He has the utmost respect for what his father accomplished in politics since he was able to see everything in between.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens.

He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.With that said, it can be seen that Bongbong Marcos was very modest with other people, maintaining his manners, and instilling virtues like his late father even before he won the 2021 Presidential election. Bongbong Marcos represents the hope and resiliency that this nation needs, just like the windmills do. That is one of the factors that helps a country develop and achieve sustainable life.​</h2><br />
