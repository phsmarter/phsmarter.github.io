                                            Discussion A fact can be proven by using general references such as textbooks, encyclopedia, and the like. It tells us what happened and can be proven true by referring to evidence, observation and research. Opinion expresses an individual point of view. Opinions evaluate, judge or express feelings and emotions that cannot be proven right or wrong. It is what a person believes or thinks about something. Opinion differs from one person to another. Example of Fact: The Philippines is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia that has three main geographical divisions namely: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Dr. Jose Rizal is known as the national hero of the Filipino people. Emilio Aguinaldo is the 1 President of the Republic of the Philippines. The People Power Revolution, also known as the EDSA Revolution, was a series of popular demonstrations in the Philippines from February 22-25, 1986. Taal Volcano is a large caldera filled by Taal Lake in the Philippines which last erupted on January 12, 2020. Example of Opinion: Although Philippines is one small country, it has the happiest people. I like to read novels written by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Emilio Aguinaldo is the best president in the Philippine history. For me, EDSA Revolution is the most peaceful demonstration made by Filipino people. The learners affected by Taal Volcano eruption prefer face to face learning than modular learning.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The way José Rizal is celebrated in the Philippines as a national hero finds no match in the world. Shrines and monuments dedicated to his figure are abundant throughout the archipelago, and his name indicates often the most prominent street or plaza in town. Rizal is a subject in the university as it has become a symbol of Philippine patriotism. Some historians have gained fame and money becoming eminent "Rizalistas," and I was not surprised at all when I got to know that there is even a small group of religious believers in Mount Banahaw called Rizalistas, who claim Rizal is the real messiah. Rizal is the favorite among the national heroes, and the best word I find to call the relation between Filipinos and Rizal is devotion.</p><p></p><p>Although Rizal was already esteemed as a top intellectual and writer both in the Philippines and Spain, the making of Rizal as a national hero was a legitimate and well-intentioned operation carried out a few decades after his cruel execution during the American period. And the problem with having him converted into a national hero is that it has resulted in some unexpected consequences: an exaggerated focus in his life: what I have called "chismography" about Rizal, the oblivion of other world-class Filipino intellectuals – Sanciangco, De Los Reyes, Kalaw – and a neglect of what it should be most valued: his writings. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p></p><p></p><p>I remember a day in class when I asked my students what they could say about Rizal, and I was told he was a babaero (womanizer) and had many many girlfriends. "That's why he is our role model!" one said cheerfully. I remember a student telling me she failed in class because she forgot the color of the shirt Rizal was wearing when he was shot. I can recall the faces of disappointment every time I bring my foreign friends to Rizal's shrine, a reliquary-like place where you can find a long list of the professions Rizal supposedly practiced and the list of the 14 languages he was supposed to master, but nothing that could help to understand him.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I understand about dr. jose rizal is he is hardworking,kind,brave and responsible because it shows that he is really a true hero to all of us filipinos</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope my explanation helps you a lot</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

                            10. Discussion A fact can be proven by using general references such as textbooks, encyclopedia, and the like. It tells us what happened and can be proven true by referring to evidence, observation and research. Opinion expresses an individual point of view. Opinions evaluate, judge or express feelings and emotions that cannot be proven right or wrong. It is what a person believes or thinks about something. Opinion differs from one person to another. Example of Fact: The Philippines is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia that has three main geographical divisions namely: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Dr. Jose Rizal is known as the national hero of the Filipino people. Emilio Aguinaldo is the 1 President of the Republic of the Philippines. The People Power Revolution, also known as the EDSA Revolution, was a series of popular demonstrations in the Philippines from February 22-25, 1986. Taal Volcano is a large caldera filled by Taal Lake in the Philippines which last erupted on January 12, 2020. Example of Opinion: Although Philippines is one small country, it has the happiest people. I like to read novels written by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Emilio Aguinaldo is the best president in the Philippine history. For me, EDSA Revolution is the most peaceful demonstration made by Filipino people. The learners affected by Taal Volcano eruption prefer face to face learning than modular learning. When analyzing reading materials, you may consider that facts show certainties and definite information like numbers and verified record while opinions state the personal feeling of a person about something. It is also easy to look after the signal words that show whether the statement is fact or opinion. Signals words for facts include numbers, dates and statistics while signal words for opinions include words such as “prefer”, “think”, “should”, “like” and “best”. A. Directions: Look at the picture below and tell whether the following sentences state fact or opinion. Write F for fact and O for opinion. Do this in your notebook. B.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mange</p><p>- They are the succulent, aromatic fruits of an evergreen tree (Mangifera indica), a member of the cashew family (Anacardiaceae) of flowering plants. Botanically, mango is a drupe, consisting of an outer skin, a fleshy edible portion, and a central stone enclosing a single seed – also called stone fruit, like a plum, cherry, or peach</p><p>-1. Mangoes may help whittle your middle.
</p><p>
</p><p>They may seem more like a decadent dessert than a healthy fruit, but mangoes are diet-friendly. Because they’re naturally sweet, eating them can help quash your cravings for candy or other sugary foods. A one-cup serving of fresh mango has 100 calories, and because that same serving has three grams of filling fiber, you’ll feel fuller on fewer calories. In fact, mangoes are 83% water by weight, and research from Penn State University has shown that eating foods that have a high water content (and lower energy density) help to keep you fuller while eating less. In fact, one of their studies found that eating a piece of fruit before a meal reduced the calories consumed at that meal by 15 percent.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jose Rizal became a national hero in the Philippines because he fought for independence in a calm but effective manner.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to Jose Rizal, the story describes human beings as being able to evolve beyond their animalistic instincts.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Name: Jane Smith</p><p>Address: 123 Main St. Anytown, USA</p><p>Birthdate: June 15, 1985</p><p>Birthplace: Chicago, Illinois, USA</p><p>Highest Educational Attainment: Bachelor's Degree in Education</p><p>Principle in life: Treat others as you would like to be treated.</p><p></p><p>1. Jose Rizal is a true hero not only for Filipinos but for people all over the world. He used his talents and intelligence to fight for the rights and freedom of his countrymen. His sacrifice and bravery inspired many generations to stand up for what is right and just. For me, he embodies what a hero should be - selfless, intelligent, and compassionate.</p><p></p><p>2. Like Jose Rizal, I value education and the pursuit of knowledge. I believe that education is the key to unlocking opportunities and achieving one's dreams. I also share his love for literature, art, and music. He was a well-rounded individual who excelled in many fields, and I also strive for a balanced and fulfilling life.</p><p></p><p>3. One thing that I have differently from Jose Rizal is my nationality and cultural background. Although we share a common humanity, we have different experiences and perspectives shaped by our upbringing and environment. I also have not faced the same kind of oppression and injustice that he did as a Filipino living under Spanish colonial rule.</p><p></p><p>4. One vivid memory I have about love of country is when I participated in a rally for immigrant rights. There were people from different countries and cultures, but we all came together to demand equality and respect for all. It was inspiring to see people of different backgrounds unite for a common cause and fight for what they believe in.</p><p></p><p>5. In my opinion, nationalism or patriotism is best exhibited by serving others and the greater good. This can be done in many ways, such as volunteering in your community, standing up for the rights of marginalized groups, or contributing to the development of your country. It does not necessarily mean blindly following your government or country, but doing what is right and just for the benefit of all. Jose Rizal exhibited this kind of nationalism through his writings, advocacy, and sacrifice for his country.</p><br />
