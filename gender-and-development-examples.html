                                            I Will Do This Direction: Below are the concepts related to Socialization. You have to read and understand these concepts and answer the activities afterwards, Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. Conflict Perspective An interactionist studying socialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication. For example, dressing baby boys in blue and baby girls in pink is one small way we convey messages about differences in gender roles. Symbolic Interactionism​</a>

                                            "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".

In order to try to meet these expectations and be seen as men, participants described putting on a performance that was like wearing a mask or “putting my man face on.” This process included learning societal expectations of them as men, as well as specific cultural group expectations. The men in this study were all aware that they did not neatly fit behind the mask, either as a result of personal characteristics or social identities. Their resulting insecurities led them to wearing the mask both consciously and unconsciously so that they would be seen as men by society. Select one: a. Ethnographic Research b. Action Research c.

                        <p>Gender and development is an interdisciplinary field of research and applied study that implements a feminist approach to understanding and addressing the disparate impact that economic development and globalization have on people based upon their location, gender, class background, and other socio-political identities. A strictly economic approach to development views a country's development in quantitative terms such as job creation, inflation control, and high employment – all of which aim to improve the ‘economic wellbeing’ of a country and the subsequent quality of life for its people.[1] In terms of economic development, quality of life is defined as access to necessary rights and resources including but not limited to quality education, medical facilities, affordable housing, clean environments, and low crime rate.[1] Gender and development considers many of these same factors; however, gender and development emphasizes efforts towards understanding how multifaceted these issues are in the entangled context of culture, government, and globalization. Accounting for this need, gender and development implements ethnographic research, research that studies a specific culture or group of people by physically immersing the researcher into the environment and daily routine of those being studied,[2] in order to comprehensively understand how development policy and practices affect the everyday life of targeted groups or areas.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Examples of these policies and programs include Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs), microfinance, outsourcing, and privatizing public enterprises,[4] all of which direct focus towards economic growth and suggest that advancement towards gender equality will follow. </p><br />

You have to read and understand these concepts and answer the activities afterwards, Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. Conflict Perspective An interactionist studying socialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication. For example, dressing baby boys in blue and baby girls in pink is one small way we convey messages about differences in gender roles. Symbolic Interactionism​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The social learning theory and the cognitive development theory.</p><p></p><p>Social Learning Theory:</p><p>The social learning theory suggests that gender roles and behaviors are learned through observation, imitation, and reinforcement from the people and environment around us. Children learn from observing others and imitating the behaviors and attitudes they see. They also receive reinforcement or punishment for their behaviors and learn from the consequences of their actions. This theory suggests that gender roles are not innate but are learned through socialization.</p><p>For example, a child may learn to exhibit stereotypical gender roles by observing their parents' behaviors. If a child sees their mother performing housework and taking care of the children, while their father works outside the home, the child may learn that these are the appropriate gender roles. Similarly, if a child is praised for exhibiting gender-appropriate behaviors, such as a girl being praised for being nurturing or a boy being praised for being tough, they may continue to exhibit these behaviors.</p><p></p><p>Cognitive Development Theory:</p><p>The cognitive development theory suggests that children actively construct their own understanding of gender through their experiences and interactions with the environment around them. Children develop schemas, or mental representations, of what it means to be male or female based on their observations and experiences. As children develop, they refine these schemas and integrate new information into their understanding of gender.</p><p>For example, a child may develop a schema for what it means to be a boy based on their observations of other boys around them. As they interact with more people and gain new experiences, they may refine their schema to include more complex ideas about gender, such as the idea that boys can also have emotions and be nurturing. Another example is a child who may question why they cannot wear dresses if they are a boy, challenging the idea that clothing is gendered.</p><p></p><p>Explanation</p><p></p><p>both the social learning theory and cognitive development theory offer insights into how children develop an understanding of gender. The social learning theory emphasizes the importance of environmental factors, while the cognitive development theory emphasizes the role of the child's own thinking and experiences.</p><br />

                            20. "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".

                        In terms of property ownership, gainful employment, political power, credit, education, and health outcomes, women face significant barriers to attaining equal status with men. Furthermore, women are disproportionately affected by poverty and HIV/AIDS due to a lack of resources and cultural influences.<p>- About political </p><p>- About sexual abused</p><p>- About womens are getting ignored</p><p>- About People standards</p><p>- About Strength</p><p></p><p></p><p>why gender inequality highly linked to the power struggle of women in the development process in a society?</p><p></p><p>one of this reasons why there's inequality for womans. like for example </p><p></p><strong>ABOUT POLITICAL</strong> - they think womans are weak and ain’t smart enough compared to mans, that is people can easily to vote, unlike womans. That’s inequality for womans that’s why womans are struggling.<strong>ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSED</strong> womans are easily to get sexual assault by mans. I think this is one of the example that in this society the gender equality aren't equal. i mean all genders should be treated equal, womans shouldn't do the same to mans too, But we’re talking about how womans are more not treated right, and were highly linked power struggle to womans.<strong>ABOUT WOMANS ARE GETTIG IGNORED</strong> - Some people are dragging down womans and comparing to others, and doesn't appreciate their hardworks.<strong>ABOUT PEOPLE STANDARDS</strong> - They think that Womans should be more prettier, and sexy and feminine. And plus womans are getting more bodyshame, and people cares about their skin color which is if they don't like their skin color means they're “ugly”<strong>ABOUT STRENGTH</strong> - They think womens cannot do hard works, because they're weak compared to mans. <p></p><p><strong>and this all the reasons why the gender inequality is highly linked to the power struggle of womens.</strong></p><br />

                            29. Choose the correct qualitative research design used in the following examples. Edwards (2007) explored the process of college men’s gender identity development. In order to try to meet these expectations and be seen as men, participants described putting on a performance that was like wearing a mask or “putting my man face on.” This process included learning societal expectations of them as men, as well as specific cultural group expectations. The men in this study were all aware that they did not neatly fit behind the mask, either as a result of personal characteristics or social identities. Their resulting insecurities led them to wearing the mask both consciously and unconsciously so that they would be seen as men by society. Select one: a. Ethnographic Research b. Action Research c.
