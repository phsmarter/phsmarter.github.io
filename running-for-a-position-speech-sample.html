                        <p><strong>Answer:If you’re sitting here at town hall tonight, it means you want answers. You’re here on your own time because you care about this town—and you want to make sure I care about it as much as you do. You want to make sure I’ll bring real solutions with me to office, not just bandages. Well, I’m not going to waste any of your time. My main focus today is your children.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>“Children are our future.” It’s a phrase we hear often, but it is often used without a full understanding of the implications. “Children are our future” means that children are our priority. Right now, we have some of the lowest test scores in the entire county. Not only that, our math and science scores were around 20 points lower than the state average. That is not making children our priority. That is not securing their future or the future of this town. No one wants to move to a town or stay in a town that has, to be frank, a lousy public education system.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>When I was a child here, our town was actually renowned for its stellar schools, so what changed over the last thirty years? For one thing, an exorbitantly high percentage of the town’s budget has been allocated to parks, recreation, and beautification. Not to say that money was wasted—we have an extraordinarily gorgeous town—but pristine streets won’t help our students compete at a national level when it comes time to picking a college.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>On top of that, we have a staff that is rife with teachers who have been offered tenure despite a long track record of under-performing students. During my time as superintendent of schools 10 years ago, I tried to push for a merit-based tenureship. It didn’t go through, and I’ve been pushing ever since. I think the most valuable change we can make as a town is ensuring that our teaching staff is filled with individuals who strive for perfection rather than settling for what’s merely acceptable. And what better way to motivate our schools than to give them a more appropriate budget? More money invested in our schools means a lower student-to-teacher ratio, which means student will be getting the attention they need and will have a better chance of fulfilling their true potential.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The Office of the Mayor should be held by an individual who can actually bring solutions that will change the town for the better. This town needs a drastic new approach before it’s too late. If we do things the way that they’ve always been done, then things will remain the way that they’ve always been. And that, at this point, means a continued decline in the quality of public education. Not meeting state standards is gross negligence and completely unacceptable. Don’t let it get any worse. I will not let this town go another year at the bottom of the totem pole.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>If you will elect me as your public servant,  will serve this town and the needs of its people. Those needs will change over time, but right now, as of today, the top priority is education, knowledge—the most precious and valuable resource a person can have. Vote Mahoney this Tuesday, and you’ll be voting a promising new future for this town and its youngest residents. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

We need to learn from our mistakes and chart a new course for our future.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, we need to prioritize our goals. As a candidate for public office, I am committed to putting the needs of our community first. I will work tirelessly to ensure that our children have access to quality education, our families have access to affordable healthcare, and our seniors can retire with dignity.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, we must acknowledge the challenges we face. There are no easy solutions to the problems that we face as a community, but I believe that by working together, we can overcome them. I am committed to fostering an environment of open communication and collaboration, where we can all work together towards common goals.</p><p></p><p>Finally, we must look towards the future.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. An informative speech provides information about a specific subject to an audience. The aim of an informative speech is to help your audience to understand and to remember the information you are presenting. Students will create a five minute informative speech on a topic of their choice.</p><p>SAMPLE SCENARIO</p><p>College professor lecturing on a specific topic during a class.
</p><p>Guest speaker presenting information to a group of students about how to apply for college.
</p><p>Company president presenting information about last quarter's sales to a group of board members.</p><p>2. Persuasive speech is one of the three most daily used speeches. Persuasive speech is used when presenters decide to convince their presentation or ideas to their listeners. Their goal is to convince or persuade people to believe in a certain point of view. Advertisement is one of the examples of persuasive speech. </p><p>SAMPLE SCENARIO</p><p>A teenager attempting to convince her parents that she needs to be able to stay out until 11pm instead of 10pm.
</p><p>A student council president trying to convince school administrators to allow the students to have a dance after the final football game of the season.</p><p>3. A demonstration speech is a form of informative speech where the speaker's primary purpose is to teach the audience how to complete a task (or process), and this is largely accomplished by demonstrating the task (or process) through a series of steps.</p><p>SAMPLE SCENARIO</p><p>If you’re not sure how to format your speech, here are some examples on how to write your demonstrative speech.</p><p>4. In broad terms, an entertaining speech is a speech designed to captivate an audience’s attention and regale or amuse them while delivering a message. Like more traditional informative or persuasive speeches, entertaining speeches should communicate a clear message, but the manner of speaking used in an entertaining speech is typically different. Entertaining speeches are often delivered on special occasions (e.g., a toast at a wedding, an acceptance speech at an awards banquet, a motivational speech at a conference), which is why they are sometimes referred to as special-occasion speeches. However, they can also be given on more mundane occasions, where their purpose is primarily to amuse audience members or arouse them emotionally in some way. Remember, when we use the word “entertain,” we are referring not just to humor but also to drama. The goal of an entertaining speech is to stir an audience’s emotions.</p><p>SAMPLE SCENARIO</p><p>• The content which he is speaking.
</p><p>
</p><p>• The modulation of his voice changes from time to time.
</p><p>
</p><p>Just imagine a stand up comedian who does not follow these two things and imagine the situation of the audience .Do you think the audience are going to enjoy his show?
</p><p>
</p><p>In the same way if we want to entertaining speech we have to keep three things in mind :
</p><p>
</p><p>• The content which we are going to speak should be appropriate.
</p><p>
</p><p>• Need to crack some jokes in between the speech which is related to your topic . This might be the best way to grab the attention of the audience whenever they are loosing their interest to listen. Try to change your tone as per the situation and try to relate it the present world.
</p><p>
</p><p>•Try to maintain a good body language.</p><p> FORMAL STYLE</p><p>In composition, formal style is a broad term for speech or writing marked by an impersonal, objective, and precise use of language. A formal prose style is typically used in orations, scholarly books and articles, technical reports, research papers, and legal documents.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            19. you’re running for the position of secretary in SSG and you won, what speech would you give? </h2><br />
                        <p>Hi! I’m (your name) and I’m running for secretary of Supreme Student Government, I am a grade ___ student here. Instead of discussing the superfluous and dulldetail of my life,</p><p>I’ll get straight to the point. Why I want to be a member of Supreme Student Government? It is simply because I want to be acquainted to those old and newstudents here in (school name) not because I want to be known or to be praised by everyone but to know what are the things I need to do and the thing that I should not do inimproving the school. As a new student here, one of my reason is that I wanted to become aliaison in between the student body and the administration. When I informed my friends about my interest to run as a secretary, most immediately, others are asking me how can I balance my life since I have my studies needed to be focused. Well, they might think that I can’t do it, or might also think I can. Yes! Both of these opinions are right. Why? To become one of the officers is really difficult to those who do not know how to find strategies and techniques to make the tasks given more lighter. If ever I win, I will still not forget my first priority which is my studies, though the role of being an officer is still important, academics must come first. My primary reason of going to (your academic level) is to take classes and do well in them. But what makes me the candidate for secretary? I have several qualities that I feel would make me an effective and good secretary of SSG. Having spent my (previous academic level) years as one of the classroom and SSG officers, I consider myself extremely dedicated. It’s important for an officer to be dedicated to their job because slacking off will only result into disappointment. As the former (previous position) of (SSG, etc.) on my previous school, I have proven myself as responsible already. Being an officer requires crucial responsibilities for which many individuals are depending on you. I was appointed before as the secretary on our church which is similar to SSG, coordinates between students and the administration.Experience, dedication, and responsibility mean nothing, however, without someone who is willing to work hard. In my classes, my various on-campus and off- campus (working student), I can really say that I can maintain an excellent work dynamic. These are some of the things I’ve done that might help me become a good Student Government Officer. Whether I might lose or win this election, I still wanted to emphasize my concrete and observable goals for this school, co-students and to my community as a candidate for SSG secretary. As a secretary, I should write the minutes by hand and utilize my special handwriting and spelling skills ( I pride myself in being my own spell-check). I will make the minutes clear, concise and interesting to be read for all students. Like past secretaries, I will also write up summaries of Supreme Student Government meetings andinitiatives and place these updates in restrooms around the campus. Additionally, the secretary is supposed to have communication with the other officers, something that I will commit to as a way of gaining insight and making our own Student Government more effective. It is crucially important to remember, however, that besides the specific secretarial duties, these are General Student Council responsibilities an SSG officer must fulfill.</p><p></p><p>But try to make your own speech based on your past experiences, and use this as your guide</p><p></p><p>Btw can you make it the brainliest? Thank you !</p><br />
