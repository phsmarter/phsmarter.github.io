Simultaneously, most parents and carers can recall the days whencellphones didn't exist, and kids were really left all alone for in any event half of the day. I acceptcellphones today represent an incredible interruption for students — particularly better quality phonesthat give various chances to diversion — and therefore ought to be restricted from use in schools; andyet, I represent not forbidding cellphones from student’s ownership completely, since they permitguardians to screen their kids' wellbeing.The above all else motivation behind why cellphones ought to be restricted from use in schools is thatthey represent a huge interruption in the instructive procedure. The most evident sign of suchdisturbance is cheating during tests or different tests: access to the Internet, electronic books, andtalking with peers through any messaging or correspondence application directly from the study hall.Telephone rings, approaching message signals, as well as games, meddle with the instructiveprocedure by diverting educators and students from classes. Regardless of whether the sound is onsilent, a telephone's vibration despite everything diverts students.Another reason behind banning cellphones in classes is an expanded allurement for understudies tospeak with companions as opposed to concentrating on study material. By and by, the degree ofinnovation permits sharp cell phone proprietors to consistently check their informal organisationprofiles and peruse Internet content. Messaging itself, while being a very well known method forversatile correspondence among youth, turns out to be much all the more enticing when anunderstudy is tuning in to talk however has their brain meandering.One of the abnormal occurrences of utilising cellphones in schools is cyberbullying. Cellphonecameras are being utilised increasingly more frequently to record and spread unseemly pictures, forexample, photos of understudies in bathrooms; pictures of the inner parts of understudies' storagespaces; recordings of genuine and organised battles between understudies, just as the chronicles ofthe mortification of disagreeable understudies, etc. What's more, there were situations when modestpaid ahead of time 'disposable' telephones were utilised by understudies for bomb dangers.In spite of the fact that cellphones are important for high school students regarding their security, theyshould at present be restricted from use during classes. This idea is established on a few reasons, forexample, upsetting the instructive procedure and encouraging students cheating; divertingunderstudies by the likelihood to get to the Internet, web-based life, or speak with companions;likewise, cellphones add to the spreading of the social marvel known as cyberbullying.​</a>

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</a>

Hence, the program added twoyears of Senior High School (SHS) The courses that can be learned from SHS includeaccounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary andhospitality workAlthough the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there isstil a mismatch between our schooling system and working system As regards theimplementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materialsprovided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materialsfor one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack ofsufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem.Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers aswell. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with theimplementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016.Despite these observations, Department of Education (DEPED) is optimistic that theseshortages and problems will overcame as they claim that these are being addressedMeanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) laudeDepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its Chairman, additional twoyears of education should not be seen as a burden.(Barrot, 2016, p. 92)FACTJUDGEMENTACTION​pa helpp!</a>

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons. First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore. Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced. Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing.​</a>

                            12. P-A-H-E-L-PIs the evidence provided strong or weak?Is the evidence enough to support the claim a reason?Why Cell Phones Should Not Be Allowed In SchoolsToday, practically any parent can utilise a cellphone to get some information about their whereabouts,occupation, or wellbeing. Simultaneously, most parents and carers can recall the days whencellphones didn't exist, and kids were really left all alone for in any event half of the day. I acceptcellphones today represent an incredible interruption for students — particularly better quality phonesthat give various chances to diversion — and therefore ought to be restricted from use in schools; andyet, I represent not forbidding cellphones from student’s ownership completely, since they permitguardians to screen their kids' wellbeing.The above all else motivation behind why cellphones ought to be restricted from use in schools is thatthey represent a huge interruption in the instructive procedure. The most evident sign of suchdisturbance is cheating during tests or different tests: access to the Internet, electronic books, andtalking with peers through any messaging or correspondence application directly from the study hall.Telephone rings, approaching message signals, as well as games, meddle with the instructiveprocedure by diverting educators and students from classes. Regardless of whether the sound is onsilent, a telephone's vibration despite everything diverts students.Another reason behind banning cellphones in classes is an expanded allurement for understudies tospeak with companions as opposed to concentrating on study material. By and by, the degree ofinnovation permits sharp cell phone proprietors to consistently check their informal organisationprofiles and peruse Internet content. Messaging itself, while being a very well known method forversatile correspondence among youth, turns out to be much all the more enticing when anunderstudy is tuning in to talk however has their brain meandering.One of the abnormal occurrences of utilising cellphones in schools is cyberbullying. Cellphonecameras are being utilised increasingly more frequently to record and spread unseemly pictures, forexample, photos of understudies in bathrooms; pictures of the inner parts of understudies' storagespaces; recordings of genuine and organised battles between understudies, just as the chronicles ofthe mortification of disagreeable understudies, etc. What's more, there were situations when modestpaid ahead of time 'disposable' telephones were utilised by understudies for bomb dangers.In spite of the fact that cellphones are important for high school students regarding their security, theyshould at present be restricted from use during classes. This idea is established on a few reasons, forexample, upsetting the instructive procedure and encouraging students cheating; divertingunderstudies by the likelihood to get to the Internet, web-based life, or speak with companions;likewise, cellphones add to the spreading of the social marvel known as cyberbullying.​</h2><br />

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</h2><br />

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons. First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore. Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals.
