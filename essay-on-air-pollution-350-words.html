However, no one realizes how it is harming our planet. We need to become aware of the consequences so that we can stop plastic pollution. Kids should be taught from their childhood to avoid using plastic. Similarly, adults must check each other on the same. In addition, the government must take stringent measures to stop plastic pollution before it gets too late.</p><p></p>Up rise of Plastic Pollution<p> Plastic has become one of the most used substances. It is seen every where these days, from supermarkets to common households. Why is that? Why is the use of plastic on the rise instead of diminishing? The main reason is that plastic is very cheap. It costs lesser than other alternatives like paper and cloth. This is why it is so common. </p><p></p><p>Secondly, it is very easy to use. Plastic can be used for almost anything either liquid or solid. Moreover, it comes in different forms which we can easily mold. Furthermore, we see that plastic is a non-biodegradable material. It does not leave the face of the Earth. We cannot dissolve plastic in land or water, it remains forever. Thus, more and more use of plastic means more plastic which won’t get dissolved. Thus, the uprise of plastic pollution is happening at a very rapid rate.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ꜱᴏᴜʀᴄᴇ ᴜꜱᴇᴅ /ᴄʀᴇᴅɪᴛꜱ : ɢᴏᴏɢʟᴇ</p><p></p><p>                       ⊱┈──────────────────────┈⊰</p><p></p><p></p><p>ᴍᴀʀᴄʜ 30, 2022</p><br />

                            2. Make a documentary essay (not more than 300-350 words) on how you can help prevent the existing pollution in your community</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reduce the number of trips you take in your car. Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use. Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials. Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pollution is an existing problem we are experiencing here in the Philippines, either water pollution, air pollution, and soil pollution, does we can't prevent it but we can lessen it. As a matter of fact, prevention usually happens when a problem does not exist yet. And since pollution exists long time ago the only thing we can help to lessen its negative effect to people and to our surroundings/ environment is to plant trees. Honestly, planting trees may sounds too easy to do yet we, people, either aren't doing it properly. Trees or Plants have a big impact to our life, for example, it helps us build our home, our furnitures, our technologies, our necessities, our needs, and more importantly trees also absorves dirty or polluted air and water making it a clean water and refreshing air. In short, planting trees is the easiest way to help our environment have a clean and refreshing water, air and soil. It may seems like a useless way comparing how big our problem in pollution, but if all of us are going to make effort on it, I believe that we can make a change. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Firstly, allowing children to choose their own career helps them to discover their true passions and talents. Children are naturally curious and have a sense of what interests them. By allowing them to explore their interests, they can find what they are passionate about and what they are good at. This can lead to greater job satisfaction, as they are doing something they enjoy.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, when children are allowed to choose their own career, they are more likely to take ownership of their decisions. This sense of ownership and responsibility can lead to greater motivation and effort in pursuing their chosen career path. They are also more likely to stick with their chosen career path, rather than being forced into a career that they have no interest in.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, allowing children to choose their own career can foster independence and confidence. When children make their own decisions, they learn to trust themselves and their abilities. This can lead to greater self-esteem and confidence in their own abilities to make decisions and handle challenges.</p><br />

                        <p>Academic writing is crucial because it enables you to present your own arguments about the subject, to share your ideas with others, and to participate in any conversation. As we all know, writing is a complex task that requires certain skills in order to complete. These aid in improving our ability to communicate and think critically, yet pupils nowadays lack writing abilities.</p><p></p><p>Many students struggle with their writing abilities, which may be due to a variety of issues, including a lack of exposure to English vocabularies, a lack of focused and extensive reading, a lack of knowledge and resources, errors in their syntax, as well as other factors.</p><p></p><p>Students status on academic skills is based on their educational background, for example, compare an academic paper of a student from different university like Ateneo to one who graduated from a provincial school. It would largely be different because Ateneo has more resources and is located in an urban area, thus, access to the Internet and other academic papers. A provincial school would have less resources and the Internet in the province is painfully slow.  </p><p></p><p>One more thing is that teachers need to teach not just asking the students to pass their academic papers but if we want to make our academic writing skill more quality, we need to make sure that we must focus on our study and keep on practice to improve your writing.</p><p></p><br />

                            11. the true friends are hard to find. why?essay 350 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>True friends are rare and valuable, and it is not always easy to find them. This is because true friendship requires certain qualities and characteristics that are not common in everyone. These qualities are trust, loyalty, empathy, and support, and they are essential for building and maintaining a strong and lasting friendship.</p><p></p><p>Trust is a vital component of any friendship. A true friend is someone who we can trust completely, who will keep our secrets, and who will always be honest with us. However, trust takes time to build, and it can be difficult to know who we can trust. Many people are guarded and closed off, and it can be hard to get past their defenses and develop a sense of trust.</p><p></p><p>Loyalty is another important quality of a true friend. Loyalty means standing by someone no matter what, being there for them through thick and thin, and never betraying their trust. It is not easy to find someone who is truly loyal, as many people are fickle and unreliable.</p><p></p><p>Empathy is also crucial in a friendship. A true friend is someone who can put themselves in our shoes, understand our feelings and emotions, and provide support when we need it. Empathy is not something that everyone possesses, and it can be challenging to find someone who truly understands and cares about us.</p><p></p><p>Finally, support is essential in a friendship. A true friend is someone who will always be there for us, offering a helping hand or a listening ear when we need it. They will celebrate our successes with us and offer a shoulder to cry on during tough times. Support requires effort and commitment, and it is not something that everyone is willing or able to provide.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, true friends are hard to find because they possess qualities such as trust, loyalty, empathy, and support that are not common in everyone. Building a strong and lasting friendship requires time, effort, and commitment, and it is not always easy to find someone who is willing and able to invest in a friendship in this way. However, the rewards of having a true friend are immeasurable, and it is worth the effort to seek out and nurture these important relationships.</p><p>Another reason why true friends are hard to find is that trust, loyalty, and mutual respect are essential components of a genuine friendship, and these qualities are not always easy to come by. It takes time and experience to build trust and establish a strong bond with someone, and not everyone is willing or able to invest that kind of effort into a friendship.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, true friends are hard to find because they require a certain level of vulnerability and emotional openness. To truly connect with another person, one must be willing to share their thoughts, feelings, and vulnerabilities, which can be uncomfortable or even scary for some people. For many individuals, it is easier to keep their guard up and maintain a superficial relationship rather than risking emotional intimacy and true connection.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, true friends are indeed hard to find, but that does not mean that they do not exist. While building and maintaining a genuine friendship requires time, effort, and vulnerability, the rewards of having a true friend are immeasurable. A true friend is someone who supports, encourages, and challenges us to be the best version of ourselves, and they make our lives richer, happier, and more fulfilling</p><br />

                        <p>Possible argumentative essay about bugs and their importance:</p><p></p><p>Bugs: A Vital Part of Our Ecosystem</p><p></p><p>Bugs, also known as insects or arthropods, are often seen as pests or nuisances by humans. Many people find them creepy, scary, or simply annoying, and may try to avoid them or even kill them. However, bugs play a vital role in our ecosystem and have many benefits that are often overlooked or underestimated. In this essay, I will argue that bugs are not only fascinating creatures but also essential to our survival and well-being.</p><p></p><p>First of all, bugs are important pollinators of many plants, including crops that provide us with food, fiber, and medicine. Bees, butterflies, moths, and other insects transfer pollen from flower to flower, allowing plants to reproduce and create fruits and seeds. Without pollinators, many plants would not be able to grow or produce as much as they do, which could lead to food shortages, higher prices, and less biodiversity. Moreover, bees and other insects also produce honey, beeswax, silk, and other valuable products that have been used by humans for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, bugs are crucial decomposers that help break down dead plants and animals, recycling nutrients and returning them to the soil. Ants, beetles, earthworms, and other insects shred, chew, and digest organic matter, turning it into compost, humus, or topsoil. This process is essential for the health and fertility of our soils, which in turn support the growth of plants and animals. Without decomposers, dead matter would accumulate, and the nutrients would be locked away, leading to soil degradation, erosion, and desertification.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, bugs are important predators and prey in many food chains and food webs. Many insects eat other insects or small animals, controlling their populations and preventing them from becoming pests or invasive species. Ladybugs, mantises, dragonflies, and other insects are natural enemies of aphids, mites, mosquitoes, and other pests that can harm crops or transmit diseases. On the other hand, many birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals feed on bugs, providing them with a nutritious and abundant source of protein. Without bugs, many animals would struggle to find food or would have to rely on less diverse or less nutritious sources.</p><p></p><p>Fourthly, bugs are fascinating creatures that have evolved unique adaptations, behaviors, and features. Insects come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny fairyfly to the giant beetle. They have wings, antennae, compound eyes, exoskeletons, and many other remarkable structures that allow them to survive in a wide range of environments. Insects can fly, swim, crawl, jump, or dig, and some can even emit light or produce sounds. Studying bugs can teach us about evolution, ecology, genetics, and many other fields, and can inspire us to explore and appreciate the natural world.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, bugs are not only important but also fascinating creatures that deserve our respect and protection. Instead of seeing bugs as enemies or obstacles, we should recognize their value and their contributions to our ecosystem and our society. By promoting biodiversity, sustainable agriculture, and conservation, we can ensure that bugs and other living beings can thrive and coexist in a healthy and balanced environment.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Face to face allows students to have instant gratification with answers and help. When a student is in class they can ask questions while it is fresh on their mind or help with a particular problem. If the student was at home online they would have to wait for the instructor to email them back.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:hope this helps</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> To begin, face-to-face classes provide a healthy way of learning. One reason is that it includes a discussion of the lessons, outdoor activities, and performance tasks that allow students to interact with their classmates, there is group work, and immediate feedback. Based on headspace.org.au,  It's a great way to learn compared to distance learning which only provides reading and writing tasks. It also lacks immediate feedback. It's limiting the learner's interactions and creativity because every task is done at home. If there is one experience that I and my classmates would similarly say, it would be: "It's uncomfortable." Studying at home is extremely uncomfy, it is full of distractions. Besides, students are so done with distance learning modality. They're missing their friends. They want to experience celebrating teacher's day, Valentine's day, and Christmas day in school. The students enjoy learning more in face-to-face classes since there is a lack of social interaction in distance learning.</p>#CARRYONLEARNING<br />

                            18. write an argumentative essay compost by 6 paragraph and 350 wordsTOPIC : DEATH PENALTY​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is a highly debated and controversial issue in many parts of the world. Supporters of the death penalty argue that it is necessary for maintaining law and order, while opponents argue that it is a cruel and inhumane form of punishment that has no place in a civilized society. In this essay, I will argue that the death penalty should be abolished.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime. Many studies have shown that the threat of execution does not significantly reduce the incidence of violent crime. In fact, some studies suggest that it may actually increase the rate of violent crime, as individuals who are facing the death penalty may be more likely to commit further crimes in an effort to avoid capture and prosecution.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the death penalty is often applied unfairly. Minorities, the poor, and those with mental disabilities are more likely to receive the death penalty than other defendants, even when the evidence against them is weak. This is a clear violation of the principle of equal justice under the law.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, the death penalty is irreversible. There have been numerous cases of individuals who were wrongly convicted and sentenced to death, only to be exonerated years later. If these individuals had been executed, there would be no way to undo the injustice that had been done.</p><p></p><p>Fourthly, the death penalty is a costly and inefficient system. It is far more expensive to prosecute a death penalty case than it is to prosecute a case where the defendant is facing life in prison. Additionally, appeals in death penalty cases can drag on for years, costing taxpayers millions of dollars.</p><p></p><p>Fifthly, the death penalty is a barbaric and inhumane form of punishment. There is no humane way to kill a human being, and the methods used in executions, such as lethal injection and electrocution, are often painful and cruel.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the death penalty is morally wrong. It violates the sanctity of human life and is inconsistent with the principles of a just and merciful society. Rather than seeking revenge, we should strive to create a system of justice that seeks to rehabilitate offenders and reduce crime.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the death penalty is an outdated and ineffective form of punishment that should be abolished. It is not a deterrent to crime, it is often applied unfairly, it is irreversible, it is costly and inefficient, it is barbaric and inhumane, and it is morally wrong. We should instead focus on creating a system of justice that seeks to rehabilitate offenders and reduce crime, rather than one that seeks revenge.</p><br />

                            19. Write a 350-word essay on how important the research is in humanities and social science? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research is an essential aspect of the humanities and social sciences, as it provides the foundation for understanding and interpreting the complexities of human behavior and society. Through research, scholars and practitioners in these fields can gain insights into the past, present and future, and develop new perspectives and knowledge that can inform policy and practice.</p><p></p><p>In the humanities, research plays a critical role in uncovering and interpreting the cultural and historical contexts of human experience. For example, literary scholars use research to uncover the literary, historical and cultural influences that shape literary texts. Historians use research to study the past and understand the origins and development of human societies. Research in the humanities also helps to preserve and understand the cultural heritage and the meaning of artifacts, art, and architecture.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, research in the social sciences is crucial for understanding human behavior and society. Social scientists use research to study the complex interactions between individuals, groups, and institutions that shape human behavior and social organization. For example, sociologists use research to study the dynamics of social groups and institutions, while political scientists use research to study the dynamics of political systems and decision-making. Research in the social sciences can also inform policy-making, by providing evidence-based insights into the social and economic issues that affect people's lives.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, research in the humanities and social sciences is important for the advancement of knowledge and for contributing to the improvement of society. It provides a deeper understanding of human behavior and society, and this understanding can be used to address social and economic issues, such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination. Research also helps to foster critical thinking and creativity and can help to challenge and change societal norms.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, research is an essential aspect of the humanities and social sciences. It plays a critical role in understanding and interpreting the complexities of human behavior and society, and it is crucial for the advancement of knowledge and the improvement of society. Therefore, research in the humanities and social sciences should be supported and encouraged to ensure that the knowledge generated through research can be shared and used to inform policy and practice.</p><br />

The disposal of waste has a significant impact on the environment and can lead to pollution, contamination, and health problems. One solution to this problem is composting, a process that can turn organic waste into a useful resource. Composting is an eco-friendly and sustainable method of waste management that has numerous benefits for the environment and the community.</p><p></p><p>Composting is the natural process of decomposing organic matter, such as food scraps and yard waste, into a nutrient-rich soil amendment. This process takes place in a controlled environment where the organic materials are broken down by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and insects. The resulting compost is a rich soil conditioner that can be used to improve soil fertility, prevent erosion, and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant benefits of composting is that it reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Landfills are not only unsightly, but they also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and can contaminate soil and groundwater. Composting diverts organic waste from landfills and reduces the production of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. By composting, we can reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to a healthier environment.</p><p></p><p>Composting is also an affordable and sustainable solution to waste management. It requires little to no energy or transportation costs and can be done in small-scale or large-scale operations. Composting can also be done at home, which can save money on fertilizer and reduce the amount of waste that is generated. By composting at home, individuals can contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle and reduce their impact on the environment.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage of composting is its ability to improve soil health. Compost is rich in nutrients that can improve soil structure and fertility. This can increase crop yields and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, which can be harmful to the environment. Composting also helps to prevent erosion and improve water retention in the soil, which is essential for plant growth.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its environmental benefits, composting also has social and economic advantages. Composting can create jobs in waste management, compost production, and soil remediation. It can also provide a source of income for farmers and gardeners who use compost as a soil amendment. Composting can also promote community involvement and education on sustainable practices.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, composting is an eco-friendly, sustainable, and affordable solution to waste management. It reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, improves soil health, and has social and economic benefits. By composting, we can contribute to a healthier environment and promote sustainable practices. Governments and communities should encourage and support composting initiatives as part of their waste management programs.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Reproductive Health (RH) Bill, also known as the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012, is a Philippine legislation that aims to provide universal access to reproductive health services, including family planning, maternal care, and sex education.</p><p></p><p>The RH Bill has been controversial in the Philippines, with some groups opposing it on religious and moral grounds. However, its supporters argue that the bill is necessary to address the country's high maternal mortality rate, high incidence of teenage pregnancy, and widespread poverty.</p><p></p><p>One of the key provisions of the RH Bill is the promotion of family planning services, including the provision of contraceptives, to enable couples to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. The bill also aims to provide better access to maternal care services, including pre-natal and post-natal care, to reduce the incidence of maternal deaths.</p><p></p><p>Another critical aspect of the RH Bill is providing comprehensive sex education in schools, which aims to equip young people with accurate information about reproductive health and responsible sexual behavior. This is seen as a crucial step in reducing the incidence of teenage pregnancy, which is a significant problem in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Opponents of the RH Bill argue it goes against traditional Filipino values and promotes promiscuity and immorality. However, supporters say that the bill is not promoting promiscuity but rather promoting responsible behavior and providing people with the tools to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the RH Bill is a significant step towards addressing the reproductive health needs of Filipinos, especially those who are marginalized and disadvantaged. It promotes the idea of responsible parenthood and provides people with access to the information and services they need to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. While it is still a contentious issue in the Philippines, the passage of the RH Bill represents a significant victory for those advocating for universal access to reproductive health services.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
