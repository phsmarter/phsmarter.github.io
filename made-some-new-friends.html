The schoolbuilding is in excellent conditions. And I made some new friends in my classroom. Andafter school, I get the same orders at home. My mother keeps telling me: "get up, don'tbe late, and make your bed". Some things never change!schoolFistAnswer the questions.1. Where does Yanna come from?2.

ordered a new one. It was going to be delivered on Saturday.
When Saturday came, CJ and his friend Carlo sat
in the front yard waiting for the delivery. They were excited
because they knew that they would get to play with the box.
“Big boxes are so much fun,” said CJ.
Carlo agreed and said, “We can make the box into
whatever we want.”
“Here comes the delivery truck,” yelled Carlo. As
soon as the fridge was out of the box. CJ and Carlo took out
some crayons and colored all over it .They turned it into a blue,
red, yellow and green clubhouse.
It was their clubhouse for a while. After that, CJ and

made into a fancy car,” said CJ. The box is 0.91m by 0.91m by

                                            Alvin always dreamt about having a kite. He loves to play a kite after seeing his friends play with it in the farm. He was amazed at how a thing like it can float in the air even with no wings. One day, his father made him a kite. Alvin was so happy that day because he can now play with his new kite. He immediately went to the farm where his friends used to play with their kites. He tried flying his kite, but it failed to go up into the air. He also tries fixing some of its parts but did not fly still. He tried it again and again, but it did not work. This made him feel sad. Then, his friends saw him and asked Alvin if they can join him. Since Alvin isn't good at flying a kite, his friends taught him how to do it. By simply following the wind's direction, he let his kite go with it, until the kite finally flew up high in the air. 1 what does alvin want to do?2 who gave him his first kite?3 was he able to fly kite? what is specific solution​</a>

She couldn't wait for her mom to take her to school and make some friends. When she got to her classroom, she started to show her seatmates her cool magic tricks that she learned from her uncle. At breaktime, she made conversation with her classmates and tried making lots of jokes for them to like her. But the other kids just gave her strange looks and started avoiding her. Morning classes have ended. So at lunch time, she decided to just be herself. She reintroduced herself to her seatmates she approached before, and asked about their weekend and their hobbies.

It was amazing Though I could not spend it with my friends, still I enjoyed it. I spent most of my time discovering new ideas and concepts in my English Subject. I focused on summarizing since I am fond of reading stories and loved to rewrite it on my own. Now, I understood further that summarizing is in addition to, they also taught me the guidelines on how to effectively summarize are following: First, second, third fourth, and fifth Summarizing is not as easy as the way others think it to be, for it takes time and needs more comprehension to process. In my part, I could say that I found this easier and organized since my friends provided me some graphic organizers that helped me to make my thoughts and insights more unified. Those organizers were and which texts This vacation made me realize that we could have new memories and at the same time we could also gain new learning. Remember that amidst this pandemic we could still learn new things, acquire new learning and enrich our experiences if we are really devoted to achieve them. Thank you my travel diary.

                        ➬ Laughter is the best medicine. Title - LAUGHTERIntroduction - Laughter is a powerful medicine. It attracts people in ways that cause healthy physical and emotional changes in the body. Laughter boosts your immune system, improves your mood, reduces pain, and protects you from the negative effects of stress.(Optional if you want the introduction to be longer) Nothing works faster or more consistently to restore balance to your mind and body than a good laugh. Humor lifts your spirits, gives you hope, connects you to others, and keeps you grounded, focused, and alert. It also aids in the release of anger and the forgiveness of others. Body - We used to laugh hundreds of times a day as children, but as adults, life becomes more serious and laughter becomes less frequent. However, by actively seeking out opportunities for humor and laughter, you can improve your emotional health, strengthen your relationships, find greater happiness, and even add years to your life. Conclusion - Nothing dispels rage and conflict like a good laugh. Looking for the humorous side of things can help you put problems into perspective and move on from confrontations without harboring bitterness or resentment.#Goodluck <p></p><br />

He was amazed at how a thing like it can float in the air even with no wings. One day, his father made him a kite. Alvin was so happy that day because he can now play with his new kite. He immediately went to the farm where his friends used to play with their kites. He tried flying his kite, but it failed to go up into the air. He also tries fixing some of its parts but did not fly still. He tried it again and again, but it did not work. This made him feel sad. Then, his friends saw him and asked Alvin if they can join him. Since Alvin isn't good at flying a kite, his friends taught him how to do it. By simply following the wind's direction, he let his kite go with it, until the kite finally flew up high in the air. 1 what does alvin want to do?2 who gave him his first kite?3 was he able to fly kite? what is specific solution​</h2><br />
