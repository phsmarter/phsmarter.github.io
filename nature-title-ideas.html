                                            ACTIVITY 4. READ AND LEARNLESSON 2. NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONThe term communication comes from the Latin word ‘communicare’,which means to share, impart, participate, exchange, transmit or to makecommon. As defined by Steven McCornack in his book titled “InterpersonalCommunication and You,“ communication is a process of sharing andconveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures. In order for you to betterunderstand communication, you have to take a closer look to its nature. Asyou explore its nature, you will come across the following features:Communication is a PROCESS.Communication is a process in which a source/speaker sends andencodes a message through a channel to a destination/receiver. The receiverdecodes the message in order to give an appropriate feedback. This processis dynamic or always changing as it occurs within a context which constantlyvaries depending on so many factors like the people involved, the place, thechannels used and the situation. Communication also occurs always withnoise which affects the entire process in one way or another. (This is furtherdiscussed in Lesson 3 of this module).Communication occurs between TWO OR MORE PEOPLE (the speakerand the receiver).Since communication is basically an exchange of ideas orinformation, it is two-way – there is a source of the message and adestination. This can be in a form of a face-to-face interaction, a phoneconversation, a group discussion, and even a letter correspondence.Communication can be expressed through written or spoken words(VERBAL), actions (NONVERBAL), or both spoken words and nonverbalactions at the same time.Communication has two kinds: verbal and nonverbal. Verbalcommunication is the kind of communication that uses symbols that haveuniversal meaning for all involved in the process. These symbols are knownas language used in both spoken and written communication. Nonverbalcommunication, on the other hand, is the use of symbols other than language. These symbols could be in the form of gestures, bodily actions, facialexpression, eye behavior and many more. Generally, communication takesplace with the combination of verbal and nonverbal elements as one kindcomplements the other​</a>

                            15. ACTIVITY 4. READ AND LEARNLESSON 2. NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONThe term communication comes from the Latin word ‘communicare’,which means to share, impart, participate, exchange, transmit or to makecommon. As defined by Steven McCornack in his book titled “InterpersonalCommunication and You,“ communication is a process of sharing andconveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures. In order for you to betterunderstand communication, you have to take a closer look to its nature. Asyou explore its nature, you will come across the following features:Communication is a PROCESS.Communication is a process in which a source/speaker sends andencodes a message through a channel to a destination/receiver. The receiverdecodes the message in order to give an appropriate feedback. This processis dynamic or always changing as it occurs within a context which constantlyvaries depending on so many factors like the people involved, the place, thechannels used and the situation. Communication also occurs always withnoise which affects the entire process in one way or another. (This is furtherdiscussed in Lesson 3 of this module).Communication occurs between TWO OR MORE PEOPLE (the speakerand the receiver).Since communication is basically an exchange of ideas orinformation, it is two-way – there is a source of the message and adestination. This can be in a form of a face-to-face interaction, a phoneconversation, a group discussion, and even a letter correspondence.Communication can be expressed through written or spoken words(VERBAL), actions (NONVERBAL), or both spoken words and nonverbalactions at the same time.Communication has two kinds: verbal and nonverbal. Verbalcommunication is the kind of communication that uses symbols that haveuniversal meaning for all involved in the process. These symbols are knownas language used in both spoken and written communication. Nonverbalcommunication, on the other hand, is the use of symbols other than language. These symbols could be in the form of gestures, bodily actions, facialexpression, eye behavior and many more. Generally, communication takesplace with the combination of verbal and nonverbal elements as one kindcomplements the other​</h2><br />

In the next chapter, you will have the opportunity to expand on the examples given and apply your own information and ideas to develop your critical essay. Before we begin that, we need to further examine how important it is to choose correct sources as supporting evidence for ideas. You will also explore different resources available to you where you can search to find supporting evidence because you cannot always rely on basic Internet searches to help you find the best support available. You have already explored different topics you find interesting when coming up with a topic for your expository essay, and while the content of this chapter is relevant to conducting any type of research, consider the connection to finding a suitable academic article for your critique. You may have already come across an academic journal article you would like to be the basis for your critique.
