                            15. What is World Literature?World literature is the totality of all national literatures. The formation of literature in different countries happened not at the same time, which is connected with the emergence of writing and artistic creativity.Each nation's literature has its own artistic and national features. World literature is very important for studying, still the literature of one country develops together with other national literatures. They enrich each other borrowing certain literary elements. There are a lot of scientific works on world literature, which explain the peculiarities of this phenomenon. As a concept, world literature emerged only in the 19th century when the literary connections of different countries had spread and strengthened.The term "world literature" was introduced by Jogann Wolfgang von Goethe. He used the word "Weltliteratur" in 1827. Goethe studied the characteristic features and interrelationships of different national literatures, the tendencies of their development and their achievements. He studied the works of famous writers awwhich presented different literary phenomena of different historic periods.He claimed that literature shouldn't be restrained by national boundaries. In 1894 the world saw the first book about world literature "The history of world literature. The world literature emerged because of the development of global economic and cultural relations.This global literary process was also caused by the rapid development of national literatures. In the history of world literature, we define several stages of its development such as the literature of Bronze Age, Classical literature, Early Medieval literature, Medieval literature, Early Modern and Modern literature.World literature is the cultural heritage of all humanity. It is essential to study world literature as it helps us understand the life of different people from all over the world, forms our world-outlook and acquaints us with the masterpieces of literature.QUESTION.1.
