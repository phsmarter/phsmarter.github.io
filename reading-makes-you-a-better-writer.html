                                            Read the following excepts and tell if the information provided shows cause and effect, classification, comparison, definition, or description. ___1. There are four types of transportation available in the metro. A tricycle is a motorcycle with an attached side car. It is used to transport people within villages or to nearby locations. Next, a jeepney is a homegrown transportation that can fit 16 to 22 people at a time. Its body components are usually made of stainless steel with fanciful decors. Inside, passengers will have to sit in a long cushioned bench on each side of the cab. A rather common type is the bus. Buses can fit in a maximum of 60 people at a time, and may follow a city or provincial route. Lastly is the train. Currently. there are four active train lines in Manila: the L RTA lines 1 and 2, the MRT3, and the PNR. Each train line has a specific route and it is the fastest way to get around the city.___2.If I have a choice, I would rather live by the sea than on a mountain. It's nice to wake up to the sound of the lapping waves and the smell of the fresh sea breeze. Unlike in the mountain where there's nothing much to see but trees, trees, and only trees. By the shore, you can do many things. You may dip your feet onto the cold sea water, play with sand, go boating, observe shells the choices are endless! I doubt if you can do as many things on a mountain. I can't think of any activity that I can do if ever I would live on a mountain, that's why I would rather live by the sea.1___3. Camiguin is an island off the coast of Mindanao. It is an island that formed out of one or several volcanic eruptions, thus it's called the island born of fire Despite it being the second smallest province in - the Philippines, it has so many things to offer. It has a beautiful sandbar, called White Island, which is not exactly an island but a landmass made of powdery white sand. The place is ideal for swimming as it is surrounded by clear water and two volcanoes. Another sight to behold in Camiguin is its rich coral and sea life, which may be seen when you go snorkeling in Mantigue Island. It is an islet that also has powdery white sand and blue crystal clear water. Camiguin Island itself boasts of other water forms such as falls, hot, and cold springs. Katibawasan Falls is a 250-feet high falls that cascades onto a rock pool surrounded by orchids, ferns, and boulders. Its cold water is suitable for anyone in need of being revitalized from the hot summer days. Truly, if you are in need of a refreshing summer, head off to Camiguin and witness the beauty nature has to offer.___4. The term slacktivist is a blending of two words: slacker and activist. A slacktivist is a person that performs activism online, through social media. A slacktivist's posts are usually about his or her personal advocacies, or criticism of certain personalities, issues, events, or of the government in general. It is a convenient way of voicing protest as it is only done in the comforts of one's home or favorite nook.___5. Reading is an activity that many people do not appreciate. There are so many benefits to reading. For one, reading allows you to travel to different places, time periods, or even settings without leaving the comforts of your own home. You can also meet so many different personalities from whom you can learn useful insights and values. Another benefit is that it develops your thinking skills. predicting what will happen next, criticizing a character for what he or she has done, and imagining the landscape as it is described are all thinking skills that you use when you read. Lastly, reading makes you a better writer. As you read, you experience how other people write. You learn various ways in which ideas can be expressed, and in learning so, it helps you to choose the best way to write your Own ideas. While it is true that reading is a boring activity, you can never argue against the advantages it brings you.​</a>

                                            The Commission on Population and Development said Friday that pregnancy among 15-19-year-old women in the Philippines saw a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018—or from 182,906 to 181,717.But there is a grimmer finding: Pregnancy is on the rise among girls aged between 10 and 14—specifically, a 63-percent jump from figures in 2011 and 2018. Some 2,250 babies were born to mothers in this age group two years ago.According to the commission, there are several factors responsible for the trend observed among younger adolescents and their older counterparts. These factors are both individual and institutional.Babies having babiesAmong the individual factors are the early onset of menstruation, lack of education, and exposure to risky behaviors on the internet and among their group of friends.Meanwhile, the institutional factors include information dissemination and provision of access to family planning services.Popcom chief Juan Antonio Perez III attributes the drop in pregnancy rates among the older group to institutional work.For the 10-14-year-olds, however, greater involvement of adults and institutions may be needed. The approach should be cultural, he says.A 2016 study, “Education, Earnings and Health Effects of Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines” by Alejandro Herrin, found that early childbearing reduces an adolescent’s future earning capacity because it diminishes the chances of completing high school.A lack of diploma results in a loss of P300 in income per day for young mothers.It is clear that the government must aggressively push for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by strategically addressing the individual factors that contribute to it. For instance, parents and schools must make themselves more aware of children’s activities in and out of the home or classroom—specifically, online and within their social circles.Risky behaviors are occasioned by lack of education and guidance, and adults must eschew the belief that not talking about sex is a way of protecting or shielding their daughters from harm. Quite the opposite, actually.Meanwhile, the government must do its part by sustaining the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law down to the community level to reach as many young people as possible.Perez, in an earlier statement, said that while the direct impact of such measures could be observed in households, they could make a dent on the macroeconomy, specifically by curbing poverty.Reduction of unplanned pregnancies translates in to family savings, which could be allocated to other items—education, healthcare, livelihood—that could be seen as improvements in the quality of life and investments for a better future.Children should enjoy their childhood and be given the opportunity to be deliberate about their life. Keeping them in the dark about the risks that lurk around them is not protecting them—it is making them vulnerable.MY REACTION______GUIDE QUESTION1.What is the editorial about?What is the stand or position of the writer regarding the issue?2.What are the pieces of evidence the support the editor's claim or position?3.Do you agree with the writer?Explain your answer.4.What is your reaction about the editorial?5.What do you think are the major considerations to note when doing a critical reading of a text like an editorial?​</a>

He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

                                            SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</a>

Two women passed. One said to the other “Look at that selfish old fellow, riding while his little son follows on foot!” The man then took the boy up behind him. The next traveler they met asked the man, “Is the donkey yours?” “Yes, it’s ours.” The man said, “No one would think so from the way you use it. Why, you are better able to carry the donkey than it is to carry both of you.” So, the man tied the donkey’s legs to a pole. Staggering under the weights, they carried it into town. There, they were greeted with much laughter. The man got angry and threw the donkey into the river.

                            6. Read the following excepts and tell if the information provided shows cause and effect, classification, comparison, definition, or description. ___1. There are four types of transportation available in the metro. A tricycle is a motorcycle with an attached side car. It is used to transport people within villages or to nearby locations. Next, a jeepney is a homegrown transportation that can fit 16 to 22 people at a time. Its body components are usually made of stainless steel with fanciful decors. Inside, passengers will have to sit in a long cushioned bench on each side of the cab. A rather common type is the bus. Buses can fit in a maximum of 60 people at a time, and may follow a city or provincial route. Lastly is the train. Currently. there are four active train lines in Manila: the L RTA lines 1 and 2, the MRT3, and the PNR. Each train line has a specific route and it is the fastest way to get around the city.___2.If I have a choice, I would rather live by the sea than on a mountain. It's nice to wake up to the sound of the lapping waves and the smell of the fresh sea breeze. Unlike in the mountain where there's nothing much to see but trees, trees, and only trees. By the shore, you can do many things. You may dip your feet onto the cold sea water, play with sand, go boating, observe shells the choices are endless! I doubt if you can do as many things on a mountain. I can't think of any activity that I can do if ever I would live on a mountain, that's why I would rather live by the sea.1___3. Camiguin is an island off the coast of Mindanao. It is an island that formed out of one or several volcanic eruptions, thus it's called the island born of fire Despite it being the second smallest province in - the Philippines, it has so many things to offer. It has a beautiful sandbar, called White Island, which is not exactly an island but a landmass made of powdery white sand. The place is ideal for swimming as it is surrounded by clear water and two volcanoes. Another sight to behold in Camiguin is its rich coral and sea life, which may be seen when you go snorkeling in Mantigue Island. It is an islet that also has powdery white sand and blue crystal clear water. Camiguin Island itself boasts of other water forms such as falls, hot, and cold springs. Katibawasan Falls is a 250-feet high falls that cascades onto a rock pool surrounded by orchids, ferns, and boulders. Its cold water is suitable for anyone in need of being revitalized from the hot summer days. Truly, if you are in need of a refreshing summer, head off to Camiguin and witness the beauty nature has to offer.___4. The term slacktivist is a blending of two words: slacker and activist. A slacktivist is a person that performs activism online, through social media. A slacktivist's posts are usually about his or her personal advocacies, or criticism of certain personalities, issues, events, or of the government in general. It is a convenient way of voicing protest as it is only done in the comforts of one's home or favorite nook.___5. Reading is an activity that many people do not appreciate. There are so many benefits to reading. For one, reading allows you to travel to different places, time periods, or even settings without leaving the comforts of your own home. You can also meet so many different personalities from whom you can learn useful insights and values. Another benefit is that it develops your thinking skills. predicting what will happen next, criticizing a character for what he or she has done, and imagining the landscape as it is described are all thinking skills that you use when you read. Lastly, reading makes you a better writer. As you read, you experience how other people write. You learn various ways in which ideas can be expressed, and in learning so, it helps you to choose the best way to write your Own ideas. While it is true that reading is a boring activity, you can never argue against the advantages it brings you.​</h2><br />

                            24. The Commission on Population and Development said Friday that pregnancy among 15-19-year-old women in the Philippines saw a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018—or from 182,906 to 181,717.But there is a grimmer finding: Pregnancy is on the rise among girls aged between 10 and 14—specifically, a 63-percent jump from figures in 2011 and 2018. Some 2,250 babies were born to mothers in this age group two years ago.According to the commission, there are several factors responsible for the trend observed among younger adolescents and their older counterparts. These factors are both individual and institutional.Babies having babiesAmong the individual factors are the early onset of menstruation, lack of education, and exposure to risky behaviors on the internet and among their group of friends.Meanwhile, the institutional factors include information dissemination and provision of access to family planning services.Popcom chief Juan Antonio Perez III attributes the drop in pregnancy rates among the older group to institutional work.For the 10-14-year-olds, however, greater involvement of adults and institutions may be needed. The approach should be cultural, he says.A 2016 study, “Education, Earnings and Health Effects of Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines” by Alejandro Herrin, found that early childbearing reduces an adolescent’s future earning capacity because it diminishes the chances of completing high school.A lack of diploma results in a loss of P300 in income per day for young mothers.It is clear that the government must aggressively push for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by strategically addressing the individual factors that contribute to it. For instance, parents and schools must make themselves more aware of children’s activities in and out of the home or classroom—specifically, online and within their social circles.Risky behaviors are occasioned by lack of education and guidance, and adults must eschew the belief that not talking about sex is a way of protecting or shielding their daughters from harm. Quite the opposite, actually.Meanwhile, the government must do its part by sustaining the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law down to the community level to reach as many young people as possible.Perez, in an earlier statement, said that while the direct impact of such measures could be observed in households, they could make a dent on the macroeconomy, specifically by curbing poverty.Reduction of unplanned pregnancies translates in to family savings, which could be allocated to other items—education, healthcare, livelihood—that could be seen as improvements in the quality of life and investments for a better future.Children should enjoy their childhood and be given the opportunity to be deliberate about their life. Keeping them in the dark about the risks that lurk around them is not protecting them—it is making them vulnerable.MY REACTION______GUIDE QUESTION1.What is the editorial about?What is the stand or position of the writer regarding the issue?2.What are the pieces of evidence the support the editor's claim or position?3.Do you agree with the writer?Explain your answer.4.What is your reaction about the editorial?5.What do you think are the major considerations to note when doing a critical reading of a text like an editorial?​</h2><br />

Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

                            26. SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</h2><br />

The week-long festival is held from August 16 to 26. The eight-year-old festival was launched in 2011, it was originally a gathering of some coconut farmers selling their products, making a unique presentation of their respective booths that gets better every year.The aesthetically pleasing booths are a potent sales-booster for local farmers and entrepreneurs.

Two women passed. One said to the other “Look at that selfish old fellow, riding while his little son follows on foot!” The man then took the boy up behind him. The next traveler they met asked the man, “Is the donkey yours?” “Yes, it’s ours.” The man said, “No one would think so from the way you use it. Why, you are better able to carry the donkey than it is to carry both of you.” So, the man tied the donkey’s legs to a pole. Staggering under the weights, they carried it into town. There, they were greeted with much laughter. The man got angry and threw the donkey into the river. Seizing his son by the arm, they set off home.Read and write the letter of your answer as to the mood, tone and purpose suggested by the expression.11.

                            29. What Is Education and Why Is It Important? By Ananya Mahapatra Source: https://www.atg.world/view-article/IMPORTANCEOFEDUCATION-70 Education is a learning experience where an individual learns about various aspects of life, understands the different perspectives and tries to apply it in daily life. Education is important to the children, to adults and to the society. Education gives people knowledge of the world around them and changes it into something better. It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one's life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position. While playing he will understand the logic to win it; this way they start building goals at an early stage. But parents should understand whether their children are working only for ranks and grades or acquiring some wisdom or not. It is important that they are aware of the purpose of education and how it works in real life. They start maintaining a structured life. To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions. The mind gets matured by proper education and training. A person can judge what is right and what is not. Education makes a person independent and helps him abide by the rules of the land. Education improves the standard of living of Written by: CLARIBEL C. BUENAVENTURA 3 the people. It helps people understand their needs and gives them the way to acquire them. Education provides a platform for a decent livelihood. One can take up a job in industry or another professional service if he/she is educated. Advances in medicine, war equipment, technology were possible due to constant exploration and research. People of current age carry this exploration. They could do so due to their education and knowledge about the past technology. People with higher education in science, mathematics, and technology can do this. The food production, medicine, electronic gadgets, automobiles and other luxury items were developed due to the spread of science and technology among the professionals through studies. To be a better human, an active participant in society and to gain respect from the world one should always learn new things. Leaming new things in education.
