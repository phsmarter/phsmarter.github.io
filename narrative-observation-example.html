Williams and Irurita (in Nieswiadomy, 2008) studied the personal control and emotional comfort of hospitalized patients. Interviews were conducted with 40 patients, and 75 hours of field observations were conducted. The basic psychological process identified by the researchers was labeled “optimizing personal control to facilitate emotional comfort.” Personal control referred to the ability of patients to influence their environment; emotional comfort was defined as a state of relaxation that affected the physical status of the patient. Personal control was found to be a central feature of emotional comfort. Select one: a. Action Research b. Phenomenological Research c. Narrative Research d. Grounded Theory Research e.

Personal E Narrative I have learned in this lesson that paragraph development differs according to the purpose of the writer or the choice of text type. Let's say, if I want to convince others of my opinion or point of view, I will write a 1. text. If I want to tell a story, like those in literature, what I would write is a 2. For a 3. recount, I have to draw from my past experiences while for factual recount, this has to be something I have observed or studied with expertise. As for 4. text, this is an informative text that clearly and precisely explains the WHYs and HOWs behind a phenomenon, view, or process in an authoritative manner. That is, with supporting examples, evidence, and valid sources. Lastly, to write alan 5. paragraph, it's best to write on something I know too well, or have researched myself. Here, I will either give instructions on how something works or is done step-by-step, or simply write a report about a particular topic.​</a>

 This time of the pandemic, online learning is used as one of the modes of learning delivery. Just like traditional learning, online learning also requires a great amount of work. Both emphasize giving and receiving feedback from students and teachers and that they both have to manage their time wisely to accomplish their tasks related to the teaching- learning process. Moreover, the challenges and rewards are the same in each environment. However, online learning includes both synchronous and asynchronous learning. Students need an internet connection to submit the activities. In the traditional classroom, students use paper and pen to complete the given tasks. Students' voices and raising of hands are also observed by the teachers during recitations. Given the analogy between the two, it is emphasized that education is very possible despite all circumstances that may happen and that the quality of education will not be sacrificed.</a>

A few days later, the plants had started to sprout leaves. By the end of theweek, they were about seven centimeters tall.5. Why does it rain? Warm air turns the water from rivers, lakes, and oceans into water vapor that rises into theair. That water vapors form clouds, which contain small drops of water or ice crystals (depending on howhigh the clouds is and how cold it is.) As cloud rise higher and higher, the air gets colder and colder. Whenthe water vapor in the cloud becomes too heavy, it falls back to the ground as rain or snow.​</a>

 This time of the pandemic, online learning is used as one of the modes of learning delivery. Just like traditional learning, online learning also requires a great amount of work. Both emphasize giving and receiving feedback from students and teachers and that they both have to manage their time wisely to accomplish their tasks related to the teaching- learning process. Moreover, the challenges and rewards are the same in each environment. However, online learning includes both synchronous and asynchronous learning. Students need an internet connection to submit the activities. In the traditional classroom, students use paper and pen to complete the given tasks. Students' voices and raising of hands are also observed by the teachers during recitations. Given the analogy between the two, it is emphasized that education is very possible despite all circumstances that may happen and that the quality of education will not be sacrificed.</h2><br />

As cloud rise higher and higher, the air gets colder and colder. Whenthe water vapor in the cloud becomes too heavy, it falls back to the ground as rain or snow.​</h2><br />
