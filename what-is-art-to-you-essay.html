                        ·Contemporary Art means<br /><br /> "art that has been and continues to be created during our lifetimes". Art that was created from the 1960's/1970's up until now is considered contemporary art. This type of art is known to be much more socially conscious than any previous era has been. <br /><br />Traditional Art<br /><br />Traditional art consisted of many art forms that were relevant to the past. Some of these art forms include paintings, sculptures, printmaking, mosaics and drawings. Traditional art was prominently created using cultural perspectives and ideas, this means that different cultures used different materials and processes to display their own cultural ideas. For example, "The Last Judgement" by Michelangelo, expresses his view of religion and beliefs. And, Raphael's self portrait showed realism, a common traditional technique.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are two fundamental approaches to conserve art, and this is the crux of the matter: what type of traditional art are we talking about?</p><p></p><p>Our response is conservative if we're talking about older pieces of art, such as an icon or an original item from a box. Having this art in museums so that others can see it, transferring collections between museums or responsible collectors, and having copies of books and art websites are all excellent ways to ensure that a magnificent piece like a painting or sculpture is conserved.</p><p></p><p>Second, when it comes to creative practices like traditional straw sand manufacture or regional apparel production processes, the answer is to keep them alive. Traditional craft practices are taught by teachers.Art is something that everyone should learn! If there are no students, the only way to assure that the future generation can resurrect the art is to document every stage of the process. </p><p>Many traditional arts are preserved in tourist destinations around the world, while some artists are forced to accept foreign pupils in order to keep their craft alive. Nothing, however, can assure the demise of art more than a lack of documentation. The key to insuring the survival of art is to resist this threat.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Identifying Art in your surroundings In my environment, I see art everywhere. However, the best way for me to describe art is by using the drawings I have in my room. Whenever I look at them, all I see is that they are unique. Every painting, drawing, sculpture, art comes from an artist’s mind; making it unique and personal. Even if an artist tries to imitate another’s drawing, the result will still have something different. Each artist has a special “touch,” or “thing” that makes his art in his image. Therefore, everyone’s an artist even though they don’t realize it. In my opinion, another criterion for something to be art is the emotion that it conveys. If art neither communicates an emotion nor have a meaning, then it’s useless. All the drawings I have in my room are based on a particular experience. Those drawings show what motivated the artist, and what feelings he had deep inside him while drawing. Whenever someone understands a drawing, or painting, I believe the goal of the artist is fulfilled. Unfortunately, not everyone can understand what an artist is conveying in his art because not everyone experiences the same things in life. As long as you are yourself in your art, we can consider it as art. Whenever people do things only to please others, then it’s no longer art. Art is not made to please; therefore art must not be beautiful. As a matter of fact, what is beautiful? Something beautiful for me may seem ugly to another. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it can help :)</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Art is a creative expression of an artist. It can portrait a story such as history, love story or fantasy. It can also portray the felling, mood and distress of the artist through arts. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> a working artist, it’s not enough to produce art: you need to promote your art as well. Your artistic path may be more about your inherent need to create and leave your mark on the world. However, this won’t help introduce your work to the art community.
</p><p>
</p><p>Making sure that your work reaches the right audience and potential buyers is crucial to achieving success. If you don’t make an effort to get your work out there, no one will be able to tell you how much they love it – or purchase a piece.
</p><p>
</p><p>Promoting your art should not feel overwhelming. You don’t have to do everything at once. In fact, one of the important things about successful promotion is that it is targeted to the specific aims you have in mind. This means that the very first step in promoting your art effectively is to decide what you want to achieve.If you have only just begun your art career, then you may want to concentrate on building up a reputation and a collector base in your local area. On the other hand, you may be ready to move on a national or international scale.
</p><p>
</p><p>Perhaps you want to make your mark within the community connected to your medium, or to develop the interest felt by people interested in the theme you specialize in. Evaluate your current position in terms of your art career and connections, and decide on the goals that you would like to achieve. Promote your art accordingly.
</p><p>
</p><p>At Agora Gallery we understand that promotion is an aspect of an artist’s career that should develop all the time, just as the art itself does. Here are some tips from the experts at Agora Gallery on the best strategies to promote your art effectively.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Visual art manifests itself through media, ideas, themes and sheer creative imagination. Yet all of these rely on basic structural principles that, like the elements we’ve been studying, combine to give voice to artistic expression. Incorporating the principles into your artistic vocabulary not only allows you to objectively describe artworks you may not understand, but contributes in the search for their meaning.</p><p></p><p>The first way to think about a principle is that it is something that can be repeatedly and dependably done with elements to produce some sort of visual effect in a composition.</p><p></p><p>The principles are based on sensory responses to visual input: elements APPEAR to have visual weight, movement, etc.  The principles help govern what might occur when particular elements are arranged in a particular way.  Using a chemistry analogy, the principles are the ways the elements “stick together” to make a “chemical” (in our case, an image). Principles can be confusing.  There are at least two very different but correct ways of thinking about principles.  On the one hand, a principle can be used to describe an operational cause and effect such as “bright things come forward and dull things recede”.  On the other hand, a principle can describe a high quality standard to strive for such as “unity is better than chaos” or “variation beats boredom” in a work of art.  So, the word “principle” can be used for very different purposes.</p><p></p><p>Another way to think about a principle is that it is a way to express a value judgment about a composition.  Any list of these effects may not be comprehensive, but there are some that are more commonly used (unity, balance, etc). When we say a painting has unity we are making a value judgment.  Too much unity without variety is boring and too much variation without unity is chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The principles of design help you to carefully plan and organize the elements of art so that you will hold interest and command attention.  This is sometimes referred to as visual impact.</p><p></p><p>In any work of art there is a thought process for the arrangement and use of the elements of design.  The artist who works with the principles of good composition will create a more interesting piece; it will be arranged to show a pleasing rhythm and movement.  The center of interest will be strong and the viewer will not look away, instead, they will be drawn into the work.  A good knowledge of composition is essential in producing good artwork.  Some artists today like to bend or ignore these rules and by doing so are experimenting with different forms of expression.

(The literature of this region is treated in separate articles on Chinese literature, Korean literature, and Japanese literature.) Some studies of East Asia also include the cultures of the Indochinese peninsula and adjoining islands, as well as Mongolia to the north. The logic of this occasional inclusion is based on a strict geographic definition as well as a recognition of common bonds forged through the acceptance of Buddhism by many of these cultures. China, Korea, and Japan, however, have been uniquely linked for several millennia by a common written language and by broad cultural and political connections that have ranged in spirit from the uncritically adorational to the contentious.

                        <p>1. What Makes Art Art?
</p><p>
Art is an object or piece of work that brings one pleasure. Art is also something you see or feel and you cannot even begin to describe the ways you like it or how it makes you feel. Art is something that portrays beauty and happiness.  Art lets you see the world through another person’s perspective. Most art seems to tell a story about where a person has been and the things they have encountered along the way. It lets you connect with the artist and see things through their eyes. Art is a way of expressing one’s self without words. When I think of art, I think of paintings, portraits, sketches, and sculptures The scene has two snowmen at the entrance to the covered bridge. It fills your heart with warmth and holiday spirit just to look at it.  </p><p>
</p><p>Portraits to me are art in a different sense. Some of my favorite portraits are by Martin Waugh. It is what he calls Liquid Sculpture. He uses high speed photography to capture drops of liquid as the splash into lakes and other bodies of water. To me there is just something so soothing about his work. It is amazing how a tiny drop of liquid can create such a beautiful work of art. His work impresses me, because I never really thought of liquid as art before I saw one of his photos.      
</p><p>
</p><p>The formal qualities of art work are somewhat important. I like paintings that flow smoothly with very fine brush strokes. I think some of the most beautiful art work is produced with a combination of canvas and oil paints. I like portraits that capture images I normally could not see otherwise. Portraits that capture the colors you can see when light reflects on a ripple of water amaze me. I do not know a great deal about art, but art seems to be much more opinion than ever.</p><p></p><p>2. the term "contemporaryart" refers to art made and produced by artists living today. Today's artists work in and respond to a global environment that is culturally diverse, technologically advancing, and multifaceted. Working in a wide range of mediums, contemporary artists often reflect and comment on modern-day society.</p><p>

                        <p>2. The different arts, crafts and architecture is very important as part of our culture because it portrats how we live back then.
