                                            My father's boss is a peculiar man. On one occasion, the employees heard their boss's telephone ring. It reag several times but no one answered it. It seemed as if no one was there. Someone opened the door to his office. There, inside, the employee the ringing telephone. “Sir , the telephone, please. “Yes, yes," and he walked to the door as if someone were waiting outside for him. “No, sir. I mean the telephone." “What? Oh, yes, I was about to answer it, but I was thinking of the accounts you gave me, I'm afraid that I have lost them.” The papers comprising the statement of accounts were in his hand.

The History of Philippine Journalism
Journalism in the Philippines has gone through a number of both setbacks and boosts. The history of Philippine journalism presented in this study is cited from “Journalism for Filipinos” by Malinao (2003). 
In the year 1637, the first Philippine Newsletter was published - the “Successos Felices” (Fortunate Events) of Tomas Pinpin, the father of Filipino printing.  Aside from Pinpin’s one-shot fling at journalism, the “Hojas Volantes” (Flying sheets) or Spaniards’ notice to the public, were widely distributed in the country for mass readership.

                                            Hero of the epic Biag ni Lam-Ang of the IlocanoLAM-ANG is the hero of one of the most popular Philippine folk epics, Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-Ang). The Biag ni Lam-ang, from the people of the northern Philippines, is said to be the only complete epic from a Christianized Philippine indigenous group. Exhibiting a mixture of Spanish and indigenous cultures, the earliest written record of the epic was in 1889. There are at least ten versions of the epic.SYNOPSIS OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGNamongan gives birth to a baby with incredible strength and courage, named Lam-ang. The boy asks his mother about his father’s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father, Don Juan Panganiban, had been killed by the Igorot.Later, Lam-ang finds the Igorot in a sagang, a feast celebrating a successful headhunting expedition. His father’s head is dis-played in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so many rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fishes in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amidst the applause of his companions.Lam-ang hears about a beautiful maiden named Ines Cannoyan, the daughter of the richest man in the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Sarindadan tries to seduce him but Lam-ang rejects her advances.Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang’s spokesperson. Ines’ parents ask for a bride price, which Lam-ang agrees to give.Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang’s birthplace, to continue the celebration.After the celebration, Lam-ang agrees to hunt rarang, a shellfish. He is swallowed by a giant fish, called berkakang, as he has dreamt so. However, a diver recovers his bones. The pet rooster flaps its wings and resurrects Lam-ang. He then rewards the diver and lives happily with his wife and pets.— CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine Literature, Volume 9 (Cultural Center of the Philippines, 1994)​</a>

On LENGUA PARA DIABLO, What does it tell us about the current Philippine society? Discuss this in reference to our level of poverty, unemployment rate and quality of education today​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Apo on the wall by Bj Patino is a poem that talks about the narration of a child’s point of view about his rigorous Father and the hanging photo around the wall called “Apo”. The poem tells the reality of life during the reigning of Marcos alongside with the Martial Law. It is a reflection of the scenario of what and how the Filipinos experienced the tragic and traumatic event throughout the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. “Apo on the wall” shows the real situation concerning with the different perspective between millennial and those who lived through Martial law. This masterpiece of Bj Patino advocates reasonably close to the realization of giving importance on looking back to our past, moving forward through our present and ensuring the success of our future.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. In our culture father is considered the “haligi ng tahanan”, they are the face of the family. The father reflects what kind of family you are into. They are the role models of the family. What if a father loses his able to speak for himself?</p><p></p><p>The story shows how unemployment and poverty greatly affects the situation of the family, particularly if the father is the one that is unemployed. The father in the story lost his pride and ability to speak for himself. He lost it all due to the reason that he has no work and no longer can support and contribute to his family financially. He has no more confidence to share his own views and opinions and looked down by his’ own children.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The story said “The devil ate his words” he doesn’t more gain respect from his kids, no more pride and especially his dignity was lost. The situation is truly happening now in the society. This usually happens to young family that is caused by early pregnancy for they don’t have enough proper knowledge and education. These situations are really present to our community. The situation is really difficult to the father because he needs to sacrifice all of his pride and ego to stay home and monitor to their kids. There are many possibilities that may happen the father may have another affair or may use drugs of abuse. Not just that the kids may mock their fathers and be ashamed of them for they are not earning. This is really disheartening from the father’s side. That is why proper education and guidance of the family is really important. So that we won’t have these kinds of situations in our society for the main reason of this is LACK OF EDUCATION!</p><br />

The History of Philippine Journalism
Journalism in the Philippines has gone through a number of both setbacks and boosts. The history of Philippine journalism presented in this study is cited from “Journalism for Filipinos” by Malinao (2003). 
In the year 1637, the first Philippine Newsletter was published - the “Successos Felices” (Fortunate Events) of Tomas Pinpin, the father of Filipino printing.  Aside from Pinpin’s one-shot fling at journalism, the “Hojas Volantes” (Flying sheets) or Spaniards’ notice to the public, were widely distributed in the country for mass readership.

                            29. Hero of the epic Biag ni Lam-Ang of the IlocanoLAM-ANG is the hero of one of the most popular Philippine folk epics, Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-Ang). The Biag ni Lam-ang, from the people of the northern Philippines, is said to be the only complete epic from a Christianized Philippine indigenous group. Exhibiting a mixture of Spanish and indigenous cultures, the earliest written record of the epic was in 1889. There are at least ten versions of the epic.SYNOPSIS OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGNamongan gives birth to a baby with incredible strength and courage, named Lam-ang. The boy asks his mother about his father’s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father, Don Juan Panganiban, had been killed by the Igorot.Later, Lam-ang finds the Igorot in a sagang, a feast celebrating a successful headhunting expedition. His father’s head is dis-played in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so many rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fishes in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amidst the applause of his companions.Lam-ang hears about a beautiful maiden named Ines Cannoyan, the daughter of the richest man in the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Sarindadan tries to seduce him but Lam-ang rejects her advances.Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang’s spokesperson. Ines’ parents ask for a bride price, which Lam-ang agrees to give.Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang’s birthplace, to continue the celebration.After the celebration, Lam-ang agrees to hunt rarang, a shellfish. He is swallowed by a giant fish, called berkakang, as he has dreamt so. However, a diver recovers his bones. The pet rooster flaps its wings and resurrects Lam-ang. He then rewards the diver and lives happily with his wife and pets.— CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine Literature, Volume 9 (Cultural Center of the Philippines, 1994)​</h2><br />
