                                            The Master's Hand
Wishing to encourage her young son’s progress on the piano, a mother took the small boy to a concert of the famous pianist, Paderewski. After they were seated, the mother spotted a friend in the audience and walked down the aisle to greet her. Seizing the opportunity to explore the wonders of the concert hall, the little boy rose and eventually explored his way through a door marked “No Admittance.”
When the house lights dimmed and the concert was about to begin, the mother returned to her seat and discovered that her son was missing. Suddenly, the curtains parted and the spotlights focused on the impressive Steinway piano on stage.
In horror, the mother saw her little boy sitting at the keyboard. Innocently, he then began to play "Chopsticks". The crowd reacted with anger, some shouts were heard, "Take the boy away!", "Who is bringing a little boy to a concert?!"
When Paderewski heard the uproar backstage, he grabbed his coat and rushed to the stage. Realizing what was going on, he went to the piano, reaching around the little boy from behind, the master began to improvise a countermelody to “chopsticks.” As the two of them played together, Paderewski kept whispering in the boy's ear, “Keep going. Don't quit, son... don't stop... don't stop.”
Together, the old master and the little boy transformed an embarrassing situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was mesmerized.

They go to the place in the forest where the ng to find a pot of gold. Instead, they find a child wrapped in a gold cloak embroidered with stars and amber necklace Although he is very poor and already has several children of his own, one of the Woodcutters wearing decides to take the child home with him. He has difficulty persuading his wife to take in the child, but he tells her that the boy a Star-Child The Woodcutter and his wife treat the Star-Child as one of their own children for the next ten years The Star-Child grows up to be a handsome boy, but he is also very vain. As the son of a star, he believes himself to be superior to everyone else in the village. He cannot bear people from the lowest levels of society and throws stones at beggars whenever he sees them. He also tortures and kills small animals. A gang of similarly minded children gather around the Star-Child and accept him as their leader. One day, the Star-Child and his friends throw stones at an ugly beggar woman. The Woodcutter, who is nearby, chastises the Star-Child, saying that he cannot understand why the boy behaves that way, given that he treated the Star-Child kindly ever since he found him in the forest. At these words, the beggar woman faints. When the beggar woman comes around In the Woodcutter's house, she says that her child, who was wrapped in a gold cloak embroidered with stars and wearing an amber necklace, was stolen from her by robbers in the forest ten years ago, The Star-Child is told that the woman is his mother, but he wants nothing to do with her. When she asks for a kiss before she leaves, he says, "rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee" The Star-Child goes to rejoin his friends, but they shun him and call him ugly. He finds that he now has a face like a toad and skin like an adder. He realizes that he is being punished for his mistreatment of his mother, in the hope that he might regain his former appearance if his mother forgave him, he goes off in search of her. After three years, the Star-Child arrives at a city. The soldiers who guard the city gates sell him as a slave to a Magician. The Magician tells the Star-Child that in a forest near the city there are three pieces of gold. They are a piece of white gold, a piece of yellow gold, and a piece of red gold. He tells the Star-Child to fetch the piece of white gold the next day, telling him that he will be punished if he does not bring it back. The Star-Child spends all day looking for the piece of white gold but cannot find it. As he is about to leave the forest empty-handed, he notices a Hare which is caught in a trap and frees the animal. Out of gratitude, the Hare leads the boy to the piece of white gold. Outside the city gates, a leper begs a coin from the Star-Child. The boy gives him the piece of white gold. When he returns to the Magician's house empty-handed. he is beaten. The following day, the Star-Child is sent to find the piece of yellow gold, Again, the Hare leads the Star-Child to the golden piece, again he gives the piece of gold to the begging leper and the Magician gives him a worse beating when he returns empty-handed once more. The Magician tells the Star-Child that he will kill him if he does not return with the piece of red gold the following day. However, after having been led to it by the Hare, the Star-Child gives the piece of red gold to the leper, whom he believes needs it more than he does. As soon as the Star-Child gives the piece of red gold to the beggar, the same soldiers who had sold him into slavery call him their lord and compliment him on his good looks. When the Star-Child protests that he is ugly, one of the soldiers shows him his reflection in a shield. The boy finds that he has become handsome once again. A crowd of people proclaim the Star-Child to be the king who, according to a prophecy, was to come to them that day. The Star-Child says that he cannot became king until he has earned his mother's forgiveness. He sees the beggar woman seated next to the leper The Star-Child cries at the beggar woman's feet, washing them with his tears. As a result of the kindness the Star-Child has shown them, the beggar woman and the leper magically take on the appearance of a King and Queen. The leper a revealed to be the Star-Child's father.

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life. Dodong finally decided to tell it, at a thought came to him his father might refuse to consider it.

Dodong felt saddened that he knew that what happened to him, will happen to his son as well. He knew that what happened to him will also happen to his son and to the later generations.
Dodong is a teen-ager who decides to marry at a very young age and later repent of his decision. Eventually, Dodong did tell his parents about his problem which is the conflict of the story which is his desire to marry at such a young age of 17.
Dodong was uncertain to tell his father about him and Teang which he considers truly important. The paragraph describes Dodong doing farm work while in thought of something very heavy as to how to announce a certain news to his parents. Here it also describes the characteristics of his father.</a>

                                            what is the summary of The Aged Mother?eto yung storyLong, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy.Shining was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confues, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged.”The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain’s many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. Hew rapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell.The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son.” She said. “The mountain road is full of dangers. LOOK carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther down.” The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “oh, Honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!”Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.The entire province trembled with dread. The order must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother. “Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the second day she told him what to do. “Make rope of twisted straw,” she said. “Then stretch it upon a row of flat stones and burn it on a windless night.” He called the people together and did as she said and when the blaze died down, there upon the stones, with every twist and fiber showing perfectly, lay a rope of ashes.The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer, “the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he related his story. The governor listened and then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head. “Shining needs more than strength of youth,” he said gravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten the well-known saying, “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!” That very hour the cruel law was abolished, and custom drifted into as far a past that only legend.​</a>

Duterte's father served as governor of the province of Davao and his
mother was a community activist who had a prominent role in the people power
movement that deposed the authoritarian President Ferdinand Marcos and restored
democratic rule to the Philippines. Duterte eamed a Political
Science Degree (1968) trom Lyceum of the Philippines University in Manila and a law degree
(1972) from San Beda College. In 1977, he joined the Davao
City Prosecutor's Office, where he remained until he was appointed (1986)
vice mayor of that city
Duterte was elected mayor in 1988, and he was reelected to that post twice over
the subsequent decade. Because of term-limit restrictions, he was barred from seeking
reelection in 1998, but he successfully ran for a seat
representing Davao in the Philippines House of Representatives. Upon the
completion of that term in 2001, he returned to Davao City and was once more
elected mayor. Because the term-limit restriction again came into force in 2010,
he was elected vice mayor, and his daughter Sara served as mayor. In 2013
Duterte returned to the mayor's office, this time with his son Paolo ("Pulong"
serving as vice mayor</a>

                            2. The Master's Hand
Wishing to encourage her young son’s progress on the piano, a mother took the small boy to a concert of the famous pianist, Paderewski. After they were seated, the mother spotted a friend in the audience and walked down the aisle to greet her. Seizing the opportunity to explore the wonders of the concert hall, the little boy rose and eventually explored his way through a door marked “No Admittance.”
When the house lights dimmed and the concert was about to begin, the mother returned to her seat and discovered that her son was missing. Suddenly, the curtains parted and the spotlights focused on the impressive Steinway piano on stage.
In horror, the mother saw her little boy sitting at the keyboard. Innocently, he then began to play "Chopsticks". The crowd reacted with anger, some shouts were heard, "Take the boy away!", "Who is bringing a little boy to a concert?!"
When Paderewski heard the uproar backstage, he grabbed his coat and rushed to the stage. Realizing what was going on, he went to the piano, reaching around the little boy from behind, the master began to improvise a countermelody to “chopsticks.” As the two of them played together, Paderewski kept whispering in the boy's ear, “Keep going. Don't quit, son... don't stop... don't stop.”
Together, the old master and the little boy transformed an embarrassing situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was mesmerized.

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

Dodong felt saddened that he knew that what happened to him, will happen to his son as well. He knew that what happened to him will also happen to his son and to the later generations.
Dodong is a teen-ager who decides to marry at a very young age and later repent of his decision. Eventually, Dodong did tell his parents about his problem which is the conflict of the story which is his desire to marry at such a young age of 17.
Dodong was uncertain to tell his father about him and Teang which he considers truly important.

                            9. what is the summary of The Aged Mother?eto yung storyLong, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy.Shining was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confues, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged.”The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain’s many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. Hew rapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell.The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son.” She said. “The mountain road is full of dangers. LOOK carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther down.” The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “oh, Honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!”Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.The entire province trembled with dread. The order must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother. “Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the second day she told him what to do. “Make rope of twisted straw,” she said. “Then stretch it upon a row of flat stones and burn it on a windless night.” He called the people together and did as she said and when the blaze died down, there upon the stones, with every twist and fiber showing perfectly, lay a rope of ashes.The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer, “the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he related his story. The governor listened and then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head. “Shining needs more than strength of youth,” he said gravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten the well-known saying, “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!” That very hour the cruel law was abolished, and custom drifted into as far a past that only legend.​</h2><br />

Duterte’s father served as governor of the province of Davao, and his
mother was a community activist who had a prominent role in the “people power”
movement that deposed the authoritarian President Ferdinand Marcos and restored 
democratic rule to the Philippines. Duterte earned a Political
Science Degree (1968) from Lyceum of the Philippines University in Manila and a law degree 
(1972) from San Beda College. In 1977 , he joined the Davao
City Prosecutor’s Office, where he remained until he was appointed (1986) 
vice mayor of that city.
Duterte was elected mayor in 1988, and he was reelected to that post twice over 
the subsequent decade. Because of term -limit restrictions, he was barred from seeking 
reelection in 1998, but he successfully ran for a seat
representing Davao in the Philippines House of Representatives. Upon the
completion of that term in 2001, he returned to Davao City and was once more 
elected mayor. Because the term-limit restriction again came into force in 2010, 
he was elected vice mayor, and his daughter Sara served as mayor. I n 2013 
Duterte returned to the mayor’s office, this time with his son Paolo (“Pulong”)
serving as vice mayor.</h2><br />
