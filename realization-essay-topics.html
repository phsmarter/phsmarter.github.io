What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

                                            Independent Assessment 3: The Good Beginning! Directions: Write the introduction of your argumentative essay for your chosen topic. An example has been provided for you already. Example: Based on the result of 2018 Programme for International Student As- sessment (PISA) which was released last December 1, 2019, the Philippines scored the lowest in reading comprehension among 79 participating countries and economies (Philstar.com, 2019). This finding is saddening for different educational institutions considering all their efforts to raise the literacy level of their students. On the other hand, more than the results and ranking in PISA and other agencies like it, everyone should realize that reading is a very useful skill not only in school, but also in rea life. In fact, the following are just 3 of many benefits in reading can allow us to discover a lot of things, can help us to succeed in school; and can guide us in handling real-life undertakings.​</a>

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

Thus, it also sets the standard of one's dream body. Any doctor, dietician, or nutritionist would say that the way to achieve this is just by simply eating healthier. People think that the way to eating healthier is to consume fewer fatty foods such as nuts, meat, oil and butter.

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)
_____14. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you'll get it
B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations

D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.
_____15. What is the main idea of this passage?

B. The name “Teddy Bear” is derived from President Theodore Roosevelt
C. After story got publicity via political cartoons, candy store owner created Teddy's bear

An example has been provided for you already. Example: Based on the result of 2018 Programme for International Student As- sessment (PISA) which was released last December 1, 2019, the Philippines scored the lowest in reading comprehension among 79 participating countries and economies (Philstar.com, 2019). This finding is saddening for different educational institutions considering all their efforts to raise the literacy level of their students. On the other hand, more than the results and ranking in PISA and other agencies like it, everyone should realize that reading is a very useful skill not only in school, but also in rea life. In fact, the following are just 3 of many benefits in reading can allow us to discover a lot of things, can help us to succeed in school; and can guide us in handling real-life undertakings.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Menstruation is a phenomenon unique to girls. However, it has always been surrounded by taboos and myths that exclude women from many aspects of socio-cultural life. In India, the topic has been a taboo until date. Such taboos about menstruation present in many societies impact on girls’ and women's emotional state, mentality and lifestyle and most importantly, health. The challenge, of addressing the socio-cultural taboos and beliefs in menstruation, is further compounded by the low girls’ knowledge levels and understandings of puberty, menstruation, and reproductive health. Thus, there is the need to follow a strategic approach in combating these issues. The current paper aims to discuss menstruation related myths prevalent in India, their impact on women's life, relevance of addressing these issues in primary care and a brief description about various strategies to combat them.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>a.) The Principle of the Greatest Number</p><p></p><p>One realization I have learned from the Principle of the Greatest Number is that it is often used to justify actions that are meant to benefit the majority at the expense of the minority. For example, a government may choose to implement a policy that benefits the majority of its citizens, but may negatively impact a minority group.</p><p></p><p>Another realization I have learned from the Principle of the Greatest Number is that it is not always the best ethical principle to follow. While it may be appealing to try to maximize the overall happiness or well-being of the greatest number of people, it can sometimes lead to a lack of consideration for the needs and rights of individuals or smaller groups.</p><p></p><p>b.) Deontology</p><p></p><p>One realization I have learned from deontology is that it emphasizes the importance of following moral rules and duties, regardless of the consequences. Deontologists believe that some actions, such as telling the truth or keeping a promise, are always morally right or wrong, regardless of their consequences.</p><p></p><p>Another realization I have learned from deontology is that it can sometimes conflict with other ethical theories, such as utilitarianism, which holds that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being. Deontologists may argue that certain actions, such as lying or breaking a promise, are always wrong, even if doing so would lead to a greater overall good.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>╰┈➤<strong>a.)

                            20. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ah, sa topic naman ng essay at academic writing, marami akong natutunan! Una, mas naging malinaw sa akin kung bakit kailangan ang paggamit ng tama at wastong grammar at pagbigkas. Pangalawa, naintindihan ko ang kahalagahan ng pag-aaral ng mga source at reference upang maipakita ang bansag sa mga ideya na pinapakita sa paper. At huli, natutunan ko pa rin ang mga paraan ng pagpili ng tamang topic at pag-iigi sa loob ng paksa. </p><br />
