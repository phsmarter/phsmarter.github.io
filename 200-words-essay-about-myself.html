                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Self-Reflection The field of social work is one that requires much self-reflection on the part of the worker.

While I loved learning to be more independent when it comes to school and working when I started my BSW, I also think I became harder on myself when I did not get the right grade, or the right field placement. One of the things I think I need to work own most, is finding a balance between taking responsibility for my actions and behaviors and being too hard on myself for those actions and behaviors. This, like my flexibility, comes back to emotional intelligence relating to my own self-control surrounding my own disruptive emotions, as I can work through my under-achievements without clouding my own thinking, and continue on towards my goals (Goleman,Get Access<p>Check Writing Quality</p><p>Related</p><p>Good Essays</p><p>Strengths Of Social Work Essay784 Words2 Pages</p><p>Being around my family and the obstacles that we have overcome has definitely gave me a broader perspective of life and the situations that current that can impacts us in many ways. As a social worker it is important to listen, communicate, build rapport with boundaries with our clients in order to be an effective social worker. Being a social worker requires certain core skills. Many of these I learn during my education and internships, others I have learned from different areas of my life.

The reason why I want to pursue a degree in the medical line is to someday be able to provide a subsidized medical facility to a magnitude of people in (mention your country). Hence, I study hard because without a degree I cannot attain these goals.</p><p></p><p>Aside my love for everything medical related, I love to travel and meet new people.

Not that I failed to visualize. Fate is often a hindrance. I can't get out of the shadows. It's not that I don't want to and I can't, but I really can't, maybe there's a reason. Excuses are easy to make. There's only one thing that can't: family.

please pa help po:(</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Internet is much more anonymous than the real world. People can hide their identities or even pretend to be someone they're not. This can sometimes present a real danger to children and teens who are online. Online predators may try to lure kids and teens into sexual conversations or even face-to-face meetings. Predators will sometimes send obscene material or request that kids send pictures of themselves. Therefore, it's important to teach your kids to be on their guard whenever they're online.</p><p>Teens are generally more at risk from predators. Because they are curious and want to be accepted, they may talk to a predator willingly, even if they know it's dangerous. Sometimes teens may believe they are in love with someone online, making them more likely to agree to a face-to-face meeting.</p><p>While it's not necessarily likely that your child will be contacted by a predator, the danger does exist. Below are some guidelines you can tell your kids to help them stay safe from online predators.</p><p></p><p>i hope this helpsThe Internet is much more anonymous than the real world.

Because they are curious and want to be accepted, they may talk to a predator willingly, even if they know it's dangerous. Sometimes teens may believe they are in love with someone online, making them more likely to agree to a face-to-face meeting.<br /><br />Avoid using suggestive screen names or photos. These can result in unwanted attention from online predators.<br />If someone is flattering you online, you should be wary. Although many people online are genuinely nice, predators may use flattery to try to start a relationship with a teen. This doesn't mean you need to be suspicious of everyone, but you should be careful.<br />Don't talk to anyone who wants to get too personal. If they want to talk about things that are sexual or personal, you should end the conversation. Once you get pulled into a conversation (or a relationship), it may be more difficult to stop.<br />Keep in mind that people are not always who they say they are. Predators may pretend to be children or teenagers to talk to kids online. They may use a fake profile picture and add other profile details to appear more convincing.<br />Never arrange to meet with someone you met online. Predators may try to arrange a face-to-face meeting with a child or teen. Even if the person seems nice, this can be dangerous.<br />Tell a parent or trusted adult if you encounter a problem. If anyone makes you feel uncomfortable online, you should tell a parent or trusted adult immediately. You should also save any emails or other communication because they may be needed as evidence.<br />

                        The concept of culture and its impact on the self is widely studied and is often a topic of debate. While it is true that culture affects the self, it is also true that the self affects culture to the point of determining it. In this sense, culture does affect the self but there is a limit to this influence based on the environment and the affected person. It is not surprising that people in different locations of the world view themselves in different ways owing to their interactions. Indeed, people are affected by culture in the way they think about the world and community engagement. To a great extent, culture has a large influence on our characters and personalities ad is responsible for who we are. Still, our behavior and reaction to different stimuli is dependent on our culture and the interactions we make in the environment.<br /><br />The Child Who Walks Backwards is well versed in the topic of culture and how it affects the individual. Indeed, the poem perfectly explores the theme of child abuse through the use of literary devices and unique style of writing. The repetition of certain phrases and words is important in laying out the overall argument about the role of culture in influencing the individual. For instance, the repetition of the phrase “she tells me” is perfectly articulated to communicate the role of the mother in abusing the child. This is achieved through the creation of suspicion in the stanzas and the use of oxymoron sentences to advance the theme of culture. Consequently, the use of opposing sentences is adequate in advancing the general theme of culture and the self and the interactions thereof. Through these styles, the author achieves a remarkable explanation of the concepts of self and culture.<br /><br />Still, culture and its influence on the self is also the subject of The Pedestrian<br />
