                                            The Commission on Population and Development said Friday that pregnancy among 15-19-year-old women in the Philippines saw a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018—or from 182,906 to 181,717.But there is a grimmer finding: Pregnancy is on the rise among girls aged between 10 and 14—specifically, a 63-percent jump from figures in 2011 and 2018. Some 2,250 babies were born to mothers in this age group two years ago.According to the commission, there are several factors responsible for the trend observed among younger adolescents and their older counterparts. These factors are both individual and institutional.Babies having babiesAmong the individual factors are the early onset of menstruation, lack of education, and exposure to risky behaviors on the internet and among their group of friends.Meanwhile, the institutional factors include information dissemination and provision of access to family planning services.Popcom chief Juan Antonio Perez III attributes the drop in pregnancy rates among the older group to institutional work.For the 10-14-year-olds, however, greater involvement of adults and institutions may be needed. The approach should be cultural, he says.A 2016 study, “Education, Earnings and Health Effects of Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines” by Alejandro Herrin, found that early childbearing reduces an adolescent’s future earning capacity because it diminishes the chances of completing high school.A lack of diploma results in a loss of P300 in income per day for young mothers.It is clear that the government must aggressively push for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by strategically addressing the individual factors that contribute to it. For instance, parents and schools must make themselves more aware of children’s activities in and out of the home or classroom—specifically, online and within their social circles.Risky behaviors are occasioned by lack of education and guidance, and adults must eschew the belief that not talking about sex is a way of protecting or shielding their daughters from harm. Quite the opposite, actually.Meanwhile, the government must do its part by sustaining the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law down to the community level to reach as many young people as possible.Perez, in an earlier statement, said that while the direct impact of such measures could be observed in households, they could make a dent on the macroeconomy, specifically by curbing poverty.Reduction of unplanned pregnancies translates in to family savings, which could be allocated to other items—education, healthcare, livelihood—that could be seen as improvements in the quality of life and investments for a better future.Children should enjoy their childhood and be given the opportunity to be deliberate about their life. Keeping them in the dark about the risks that lurk around them is not protecting them—it is making them vulnerable.MY REACTION______GUIDE QUESTION1.What is the editorial about?What is the stand or position of the writer regarding the issue?2.What are the pieces of evidence the support the editor's claim or position?3.Do you agree with the writer?Explain your answer.4.What is your reaction about the editorial?5.What do you think are the major considerations to note when doing a critical reading of a text like an editorial?​</a>

                                            Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</a>

                                            pa-summarize poRELATD STUDIES (LOCAL)The Philippines has earned its ranking as one of few gay-friendly countries in the world (Tubeza, 2013). A global survey said that Philippines say that homosexuality should be accepted in society (Pew Research Center, 2013). Despite its religiosity, the Philippines is one of the countries in the world where the level of public “acceptance” of homosexuals is high, according to the results of the survey (Statista, 2016). According to the survey, 78% of those aged 18-29 who interviewed said that gays should be accepted. 71 percent for those aged 30-49, and 68 percent for those 50 years old and above. A survey published by Statista Research Department in 2016, over 60 percent of the respondents do personally know are LGBT. However, only 25% of the respondents says that they support the legalization of same sex marriage. The Social Weather Survey also had the same result, 61% of their respondents says that they are disagree of legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the result of the study of Ocampo (2016), LGBTQ members agreed that going through the phase of being confused to bisexual was hard for them at first and yet as they accept themselves and from the people around them, they became comfortable of whom they are. But discrimination cannot be prevented in their life as a bisexual such as insults or getting teased. They had experienced discrimination everywhere.In School, some teachers appeared to impose their own personal values and used institutional rules to suppress people’s gender expression, including giving students lower grades than they deserved (IGLHRC, 2013). Many of the LGBT women said they felt pressured to alter their preferred gender expression while at school and while wearing school uniforms. They reported that some officials explicitly sought to change their behavior. However, according to the UNDP, USAID (2014), the Department of Education in 2012 issued an order to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity which protects their rights as students. Some also said that even in their workplace, they have experienced discrimination. Despite being educated and have better qualification, they are often denied because of their gender (IGLHRC 2013). The UNDP, USAID (2014) also said that the employers sometimes take advantage of LGBT employees. Sexual harassment of LGBT employees was reported.In addition, Ocampo (2016), the LGBT people became more open minded and got more friends same as their sexuality for being a bisexual. However, Ocampo added that being different from others did not stop them from showing their true selves for there are people who would still accept and love them for who they are.LGBTQ also experienced violence inside and outside of their family. According to International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (2013), they have experienced different violence such as physical, Verbal and Emotional Violence, Violence in the Name of Religion, Violence in Schools and Sexual violence. They’ve experienced this kind of violence are largely came from their own family members, significant others or ex-partners, co-workers, and strangers (International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 2013).​</a>

Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus.

WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</a>

                            7. The Commission on Population and Development said Friday that pregnancy among 15-19-year-old women in the Philippines saw a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018—or from 182,906 to 181,717.But there is a grimmer finding: Pregnancy is on the rise among girls aged between 10 and 14—specifically, a 63-percent jump from figures in 2011 and 2018. Some 2,250 babies were born to mothers in this age group two years ago.According to the commission, there are several factors responsible for the trend observed among younger adolescents and their older counterparts. These factors are both individual and institutional.Babies having babiesAmong the individual factors are the early onset of menstruation, lack of education, and exposure to risky behaviors on the internet and among their group of friends.Meanwhile, the institutional factors include information dissemination and provision of access to family planning services.Popcom chief Juan Antonio Perez III attributes the drop in pregnancy rates among the older group to institutional work.For the 10-14-year-olds, however, greater involvement of adults and institutions may be needed. The approach should be cultural, he says.A 2016 study, “Education, Earnings and Health Effects of Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines” by Alejandro Herrin, found that early childbearing reduces an adolescent’s future earning capacity because it diminishes the chances of completing high school.A lack of diploma results in a loss of P300 in income per day for young mothers.It is clear that the government must aggressively push for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by strategically addressing the individual factors that contribute to it. For instance, parents and schools must make themselves more aware of children’s activities in and out of the home or classroom—specifically, online and within their social circles.Risky behaviors are occasioned by lack of education and guidance, and adults must eschew the belief that not talking about sex is a way of protecting or shielding their daughters from harm. Quite the opposite, actually.Meanwhile, the government must do its part by sustaining the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law down to the community level to reach as many young people as possible.Perez, in an earlier statement, said that while the direct impact of such measures could be observed in households, they could make a dent on the macroeconomy, specifically by curbing poverty.Reduction of unplanned pregnancies translates in to family savings, which could be allocated to other items—education, healthcare, livelihood—that could be seen as improvements in the quality of life and investments for a better future.Children should enjoy their childhood and be given the opportunity to be deliberate about their life. Keeping them in the dark about the risks that lurk around them is not protecting them—it is making them vulnerable.MY REACTION______GUIDE QUESTION1.What is the editorial about?What is the stand or position of the writer regarding the issue?2.What are the pieces of evidence the support the editor's claim or position?3.Do you agree with the writer?Explain your answer.4.What is your reaction about the editorial?5.What do you think are the major considerations to note when doing a critical reading of a text like an editorial?​</h2><br />

CategoryIn the News·         Date PublishedJan 09, 2023National Achievement Test for Grade 12 students setMANILA, Philippines — Grade 12 students from public and private schools will be taking the National Achievement Test (NAT) by the end of the month.In a memorandum released on Jan. 5, Education Undersecretary Epimaco Densing said the exit assessment, which was designed to be “progressive in nature,” would be administered on Jan. 30 and Jan. 31.“DepEd has to identify and articulate indicators and targets for measuring performance in the development of plans and policies,” he said.The test results will serve as data and evidence in improving the implementation of the curriculum, as well as evidence-based decision-making.According to Densing, the test items would measure varying levels of skills through a multiple-choice paper-based format.“It is designed to determine if graduating learners are meeting the learning standard in the senior high school (SHS) curriculum,” he said.The NAT result will also give insight into the percentage of Grade 12 students who have the minimum level of proficiency in the fourth stage of the SHS core areas.The test will cover 21st-century skills and the primary learning topics in SHS including languages, humanities, communication, mathematics, science, social science, and philosophy.An online national orientation was held on Jan. 6 to issue the specific guidelines for the test administration and the tasks of field-testing personnel and download of program support funds by the schools’ division office.In a study published last year, the government think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) pointed out that failure to let the public know about the NAT results had contributed to the ongoing education crisis.“Even though we continuously administer national achievement tests, the results are never granularly available for in-depth analysis and even less public discussion,” said the report authored by PIDS president Aniceto Orbeta Jr. and research fellow vicente paqueo help!!​</h2><br />

                            14. Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</h2><br />

                            22. pa-summarize poRELATD STUDIES (LOCAL)The Philippines has earned its ranking as one of few gay-friendly countries in the world (Tubeza, 2013). A global survey said that Philippines say that homosexuality should be accepted in society (Pew Research Center, 2013). Despite its religiosity, the Philippines is one of the countries in the world where the level of public “acceptance” of homosexuals is high, according to the results of the survey (Statista, 2016). According to the survey, 78% of those aged 18-29 who interviewed said that gays should be accepted. 71 percent for those aged 30-49, and 68 percent for those 50 years old and above. A survey published by Statista Research Department in 2016, over 60 percent of the respondents do personally know are LGBT. However, only 25% of the respondents says that they support the legalization of same sex marriage. The Social Weather Survey also had the same result, 61% of their respondents says that they are disagree of legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the result of the study of Ocampo (2016), LGBTQ members agreed that going through the phase of being confused to bisexual was hard for them at first and yet as they accept themselves and from the people around them, they became comfortable of whom they are. But discrimination cannot be prevented in their life as a bisexual such as insults or getting teased. They had experienced discrimination everywhere.In School, some teachers appeared to impose their own personal values and used institutional rules to suppress people’s gender expression, including giving students lower grades than they deserved (IGLHRC, 2013). Many of the LGBT women said they felt pressured to alter their preferred gender expression while at school and while wearing school uniforms. They reported that some officials explicitly sought to change their behavior. However, according to the UNDP, USAID (2014), the Department of Education in 2012 issued an order to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity which protects their rights as students. Some also said that even in their workplace, they have experienced discrimination. Despite being educated and have better qualification, they are often denied because of their gender (IGLHRC 2013). The UNDP, USAID (2014) also said that the employers sometimes take advantage of LGBT employees. Sexual harassment of LGBT employees was reported.In addition, Ocampo (2016), the LGBT people became more open minded and got more friends same as their sexuality for being a bisexual. However, Ocampo added that being different from others did not stop them from showing their true selves for there are people who would still accept and love them for who they are.LGBTQ also experienced violence inside and outside of their family. According to International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (2013), they have experienced different violence such as physical, Verbal and Emotional Violence, Violence in the Name of Religion, Violence in Schools and Sexual violence. They’ve experienced this kind of violence are largely came from their own family members, significant others or ex-partners, co-workers, and strangers (International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 2013).​</h2><br />

Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school.
