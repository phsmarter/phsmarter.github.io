                                            Directions: Read the passage, and answer the question that follows:
During the Great Depression, many people in our town didn’t have jobs or much money. It wasn’t easy to have fun, but Thursday nights became special for many people. The owner of the local theatre projected a movie on the wall of a building. Everyone saw the movie for free! 
We’d bring our own chairs and arrive early to find a good spot for viewing. Then, if we were lucky enough to have a few pennies, we’d buy hard candy or popcorn to eat while watching the show. After the movie started, we’d laugh and slap our knees for comedians. We’d scream and cheer for daring adventurers, and sigh over beautiful heroines. Later, as we folded up our chairs and headed home, we all felt a little less worried about being poor and unemployed.
Number the events below in order from first to last.
____ We laughed, cheered, and sighed as we watched the movie.
____ We went home feeling a little better.
____ We arrived and found a place to view the free movie
____ We bought candy and popcorn to eat during the movie.</a>

During the Great Depression, many people in our town didn’t have jobs or much money. It wasn’t easy to have fun, but Thursday nights became special for many people. The owner of the local theatre projected a movie on the wall of a building. Everyone saw the movie for free! 
We’d bring our own chairs and arrive early to find a good spot for viewing. Then, if we were lucky enough to have a few pennies, we’d buy hard candy or popcorn to eat while watching the show. After the movie started, we’d laugh and slap our knees for comedians. We’d scream and cheer for daring adventurers, and sigh over beautiful heroines. Later, as we folded up our chairs and headed home, we all felt a little less worried about being poor and unemployed.
Number the events below in order from first to last.
____ We laughed, cheered, and sighed as we watched the movie.
____ We went home feeling a little better.
____ We arrived and found a place to view the free movie
____ We bought candy and popcorn to eat during the movie.</h2><br />
