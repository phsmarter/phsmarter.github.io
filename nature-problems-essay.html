                                            11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!"

He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

Topic Sentence/Main point Making and Keeping Friends f Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort. Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. (4) There are important things to remember in making and keeping friends. (5) A lot of friends are having things in common, so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. (6) For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. (7) Showing you care about the other person's happiness isS another important part of being friends. (8) Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. (9) Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable.(10) A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care.​</a>

Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air especially in highly urbanized towns and cities mainly because the government lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise, the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories that emit gas elsewhere. More often than not, air pollution is caused by natural events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, and pollen dispersal.​</a>

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care

                            1. create essay Product/nature of the activity How the program can help to solve the health problem?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The product/nature of the activity refers to the type of program or intervention that is designed to address specific health issues. This can range from physical activities such as exercise programs to mental health interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. The goal of such programs is to improve overall health and wellbeing by addressing specific health concerns.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One way that these programs can help to solve health problems is by providing individuals with the necessary tools and resources to manage their conditions effectively. For example, a diabetes management program may provide individuals with information on healthy eating habits, exercise routines, and medication management strategies. By following these guidelines, individuals can better manage their condition and reduce the risk of complications.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Additionally, these programs can help to prevent the onset of certain health conditions by promoting healthy behaviors and lifestyles. For example, a smoking cessation program may provide individuals with resources and support to quit smoking, reducing their risk of developing lung cancer and other smoking-related illnesses.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another way that these programs can help to solve health problems is by improving access to healthcare services. Many individuals may not have access to healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of transportation. Programs that provide free or low-cost healthcare services can help to bridge this gap and ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, the product/nature of the activity plays a crucial role in addressing various health concerns. These programs can help individuals manage their conditions effectively, prevent the onset of certain health conditions, and improve access to healthcare services.

                            4. 11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

The fourth argument is that marine mammals breed poorly in captivity with high infant death rates.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: The essay concludes that marine mammals should not be held in captivity and that it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!"

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are many ways of understanding the nature of philosophical questions. One may consider their morphology, semantics, relevance, or scope. This article introduces a different approach, based on the kind of informational resources required to answer them. The result is a definition of philosophical questions as questions whose answers are in principle open to informed, rational, and honest disagreement, ultimate but not absolute, closed under further questioning, possibly constrained by empirical and logico-mathematical resources, but requiring  noetic resources to be answered.

                            24. What is It How to write paragraphs with cause-and-effect, comparison-and-contrast, and problem-solution relationships? Cause and Effect Relationship A cause-and-effect text explains the reasons and results of events, situations, or trends. There are three patterns or types of cause-and-effect essays. Cause 1 Cause 2 Effect Cause 3 Multiple Causes-One Effect Cause 1 Cause 2 Cause 3 One Cause Effect 1 Effect 2 Effect 1 One Cause-Multiple Effects Effect 3 Effect 2 Effect 3 Cause-Effect Chain Read an example of a cause-and-effect paragraph below. Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air especially in highly urbanized towns and cities mainly because the government lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise, the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories that emit gas elsewhere. More often than not, air pollution is caused by natural events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, and pollen dispersal.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Writing paragraphs with cause-and-effect, comparison-and-contrast, and problem-solution relationships involves identifying the relationship between two or more concepts and presenting them in a coherent manner.</p><p></p><p>For a cause-and-effect paragraph, the writer should clearly explain the causes and effects of an event, situation, or trend. There are different patterns or types of cause-and-effect relationships, including single and multiple causes with one or multiple effects, as well as a cause-effect chain. The writer should use transition words and phrases to connect the causes and effects, such as "because," "therefore," "as a result," and "consequently."</p><p></p><p>Here is an example of a cause-and-effect paragraph on air pollution:</p><p></p><p>Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events.

The writer should use transition words and phrases such as "similarly," "in contrast," "unlike," and "on the other hand" to signal the comparison or contrast.</p><p></p><p>For a problem-solution paragraph, the writer should identify a problem and propose a solution to it. The paragraph should start with a clear statement of the problem and its impact. The solution should be presented in a logical and organized manner, with supporting evidence and examples. The writer should use transition words and phrases such as "one solution is," "the best approach is," and "to solve this problem" to signal the solution. The paragraph should end with a call to action or a recommendation for the reader.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, writing paragraphs with cause-and-effect, comparison-and-contrast, and problem-solution relationships requires a clear understanding of the concepts being discussed and their interrelationships. The writer should use appropriate transitional words and phrases to guide the reader through the text and provide supporting evidence and examples to enhance their understanding.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pa brainliest po If my answer are correct for you and Thanks</p><br />

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care
