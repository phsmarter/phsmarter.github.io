</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Health and fitness are two concepts that go hand in hand. Our health is the totality of our physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. Fitness, on the other hand, is a state of control over our body. Thus, we could be physical, mentally and emotionally fit. Consequently, health and fitness can be regarded as a way to attaining control over our body.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ori,as you have already seen it from my profile,obviously is not my original name I adopted this from a game,called Ori and the Blind Forest.The exact reason behind adopting this name may vary from the attachment towards this character named Ori or just simply the name sounds appealing to me.May be now we can move from solving my name’s mystery to myself.I am a sort of person who wants to be happy and keep people in his surrounding even happier.There are people who had clear set of aims in life,even when they are in high school they know or pre-planned which university they will join or atleast try to get into;whether they will join a certain organization or start their own buisness set-up.I am 1 billion percent(took this term from dr.stone) sure that I am not one of them.Life sets plan for myself,I try to reach them but most of the times I try to change these goals because of their monotonous nature since I am a student and students’ goals directly or indirectly do involve studies which for me,and for most of people out there, is monotonous. As my word count is very close to the threshold mentioned in the question,I will sum-up by jotting down the peculiar aspects related to my personality.First,I am a football lover and big fan of cristiano ronaldo since I was 10 or 12 years old.Second,I used to watch alot of anime with atleast 5 to 7 anime concurrently,but now I have lost my tempo may be because of educational pressure or the animes are not good enough to give someone impetus to watch more and more.Thirdly,I am infatuated with dota 2-video game- I have been playing this game since 2015 and that might be the reason behind my failure in the exam I appeared few months ago.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Discipline begins at home. This is because the home is the first place where children learn and develop their behavior and habits. It is the responsibility of parents and caregivers to set rules and boundaries for children to follow and to consistently enforce those rules. This helps children understand the expectations and consequences of their actions, and teaches them self-control and responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Having discipline at home also creates a safe and stable environment for children to grow and learn. It allows them to feel secure and supported, which can help them develop a positive sense of self-worth and self-esteem. In addition, discipline at home can promote good behavior and manners in children, which can help them navigate social situations and build healthy relationships with others.</p><p></p><p>Overall, discipline begins at home and is an essential part of raising well-rounded and successful individuals. It teaches children the value of self-control and responsibility, and sets them up for success in their future endeavors.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana nakatulong</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Universe", being that the Universe is all of space-time and everything that exists therein, including all planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, the smallest subatomic particles, and all known matter and energy.</p><p></p><p>It goes on to talk about the observable universe which is approximately 46 Billion light-years in radius. While this data is all well and good, here to me is where some of our thinking about the Universe breaks somewhat with logic. The common scientifically published 'age of the universe' is 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years old, which goes on to say that Universal Expansion is the reasoning behind this dating when correlated with the radius of the known Universe.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I think the Universe is *much* older than that, possibly countless trillions of years old, and my reasoning behind that is pretty simple really: We can detect a radius of approx. 46G-ly, but how long have we had instruments trained on the region of space that we determine to be the edge of this Universe? When we look really deep into the void, our instruments detect the light of objects already in existence, not objects forming, but already existing. If the Universe were only 13-to-15 billion years old as some have suggested, then logic would dictate that the farthest away objects observable due to the speed of photonic motion (light-speed) would have the appearance of an accretion process or something similarly along those lines which would be in line with the (so called) laws of physics at the cosmic scale. However, I've never read a single article out of the cosmology community that made any such claims. Of course, with something so distant, could we even hope to get the level of detail to discern what objects at that distance are doing?</p><p></p><p>What is the Universe? If considered along the lines of quantum mechanics, then evidence shows the fundamental makeup of the Universe to be arrangements of energies that transcend the observable reality in which we find ourselves. One of the best examples of this is the most simple molecule we know... hydrogen. Hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 electron. As the electron orbits the proton, it disappears rather than making a full orbit, but yet when the electron reappears, it's perfectly in line with the orbital path that it left before disappearing. The big question here is where does this electron go?</p><p></p><p>I tend to put that information in the same category as "Where did the void come from in which we find our Universe?". A great mystery with no foreseeable answer in sight, at least not at our current level of technological progression. Maybe we'll understand these things better by the time we become a Type-2 or Type-3 civilization, but so long as we are a Type-0 civilization, these answers will remain out of reach.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Sports have the power to transform individuals into their best versions by pushing them beyond their physical and mental limits. Engaging in sports allows people to develop valuable traits such as perseverance, discipline, teamwork, and leadership, which can be applied in various aspects of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Sports require individuals to set goals, work hard, and commit to a regular training regimen to achieve their desired outcomes. These habits translate into other aspects of life, such as education or careers, where discipline and hard work are necessary to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Team sports, in particular, teach individuals about cooperation and communication, two vital skills in any team-oriented setting. Through working together with teammates, individuals learn to value the contributions of others and find ways to work collaboratively to achieve common goals.</p><p></p><p>Sports can also boost self-confidence and self-esteem. When an individual sets and achieves personal bests or sees improvements in their physical abilities, they gain a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can spill over into other areas of life.</p><p></p><p>In summary, sports have the potential to transform individuals into the best versions of themselves by developing valuable skills and attributes, including discipline, perseverance, teamwork, leadership, communication, and self-confidence. These traits are highly valued in any aspect of life, and the benefits of participating in sports can be seen beyond the field of play.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Metric system, as known as International System of Units, is an internationally recognized system of measurement. Metric units are multiples of ten of the base unit. The three most common units in the metric system are the meter, gram and liter. The prefixes of these units are: kilo-, hecto-, deka-, centi-, and milli-. In order to better help you remember the order of the units' sizes, use this memory aid:</p><p></p><p>King Henry Doesn't (Usually) Drink Chocolate Milk</p><p>The first letter of each of the above words correspond to the different prefixes, with the "U" in "Usually" standing for "unit", which reminds you that there's a unit of either meters, grams, or liters. Each of these prefixes are 10 times or 1/10th of the units on either side of them. So for example:</p><p></p><p>1 kilogram = 10 hectagram = 100 dekagram = (1000 grams) = 10,000 decigrams = 100,000 centigrams = 1,000,000 milligrams</p><p></p><p>As you can see, carrying out metric conversion between units is relatively simple as they're all multiples of tens of one another. This means that by moving the decimal point, you'll be able to convert between them. For a general rule, when you move from a bigger unit to a smaller unit (a unit that's to the right in the above memory aid), move the decimal place to the right an equal number of places. The same is said for moving left, when we move from a smaller number to a bigger one in unit conversion.</p><p></p><p>In this tutorial we will show you how to convert cm to m (centimeter to meter) and m to km (meter to kilometer). Refer to the below metric conversion table to help guide you.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>English po to ah: )</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>We don't need to compare our selves to others. Why? Because we have different talents, abilities and strengths. God made us with special abilities.. We need to give it importance, and we don't need to say or even think that we are ugly, short, and more because if we think that way, we are judging God's creation.. Some people said, no one is ugly, there is only people who don't appreciate and respect themselves. I believe that it is true. Always remember we are beautiful just the way we are, we don't need anyone's judgement to say we are beautiful. We need to be proud of ourselves and be thankful of what we have..</p><p></p><p>HAHA ayan na po, sana makatulong ❤️</p><p>At correct nyo na lang po kung May mali akong grammar,</p><p>Tas comment nyo na lng po kung kulang sya sa 100 dadagdagan ko: )</p><p>Di ko na po binilang,</p><br />
