Timola A morning audition with one direction, looking at same place pausing and breathing together, as it feeling so tensed in placing the right hand on the left chest. Listening at their heart beats. Following the line standing straight from the cutest to the group up to the gigantic one. Everyone is excited to be part of the contest, having only one choice of song that all are familiar yet seems so unfamiliar. A singing contest without a juror to judge the voice quality. However, when people heard the song, whatever they are doing, and whenever they are, they will pause for a moment and encouraged a standing ovation. The sound that gains our respect and always a special guest in important occasions. All are aware on the scripted speech. One song that unitë every Filipino though we mispronounced the words, maltreated the melody.rumbled the lyrics and people tend to sing it with laziness. But the good news is, it never leaves us nor forsakes us. It gives us identity and pride among nations. Some says that there's no forever. Yes, but this mysterious song that we have taken for granted is always with us now and forever. The song is familiar, yet we really don't know the title, finally the host signals the start of the show" Bayang magiliw, ready sing."​</a>

                                            Pandemic: A Message of Hope We slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized that Paris is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyone sleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparents became an act of love, Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not that valuable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one will ever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties. Enjoy our life when we have one. The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve around is so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we are finally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home and family that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent our time, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things we cherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were never really grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest of reminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look within ourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunity to heal. Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thing that it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through, learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us all together like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positive or optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or be the light in the darkness that everyone wants to see. If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a little longer, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that still has hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos. Questions; 1.Which parts of that motivational speech (sentences or paragraphs) you have given more emphasis when you delivered it? 2. How did you give emphasis on those parts? why? 3. Were you able to effectively deliver the speech verbally (tone,volume,and speed of voices, filters, pauses, and pronounciation)? 4. Were you able to effectively deliver the speech non-verbally (body movements, facial expressions, eye contacts, gestures, posture, and mastery)? 5. What do you think is/are your weakness/es whenever you are asked to speak in public or to deliver a speech in any situations? ​</a>

Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</a>

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2.

I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4.

If people think you are not good enough, and won’t accept you for yourself you may feel you have to change or that you’ll never be able to amount to anything in the first place. But things will be out of your control that you will not be able to change – you may feel that there is no purpose for you in this world.</p><p></p><p>At this point you can go down the road which will cause you to give up, or the road where you can make the best of what you have. Don’t listen to the judgement of others and make sure you have the strength within yourself to carry on. You can always get back up from the falls you face, there is always hope and happiness just around the corner. Enjoy every moment you have and live life to its fullest.</p><p></p><br />

Listening at their heart beats. Following the line standing straight from the cutest to the group up to the gigantic one. Everyone is excited to be part of the contest, having only one choice of song that all are familiar yet seems so unfamiliar. A singing contest without a juror to judge the voice quality. However, when people heard the song, whatever they are doing, and whenever they are, they will pause for a moment and encouraged a standing ovation. The sound that gains our respect and always a special guest in important occasions. All are aware on the scripted speech. One song that unitë every Filipino though we mispronounced the words, maltreated the melody.rumbled the lyrics and people tend to sing it with laziness. But the good news is, it never leaves us nor forsakes us. It gives us identity and pride among nations. Some says that there's no forever. Yes, but this mysterious song that we have taken for granted is always with us now and forever. The song is familiar, yet we really don't know the title, finally the host signals the start of the show" Bayang magiliw, ready sing."​</h2><br />

                            5. Pandemic: A Message of Hope We slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized that Paris is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyone sleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparents became an act of love, Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not that valuable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one will ever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties. Enjoy our life when we have one. The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve around is so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we are finally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home and family that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent our time, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things we cherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were never really grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest of reminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look within ourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunity to heal. Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thing that it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through, learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us all together like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positive or optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or be the light in the darkness that everyone wants to see. If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a little longer, and stare a little harder.

                            6. Pandemic: A Message of HopeWe slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized thatParis is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyonesleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparentsbecame an act of love,Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not thatvaluable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one willever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties.Enjoy our life when we have one.The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve aroundis so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we arefinally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home andfamily that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent ourtime, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things wecherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were neverreally grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest ofreminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look withinourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunityto heal.Now, I do not know when this will end.

I just want to work and be busy" And they responded, "ok, it's your responsibility, but do not expect me to give you anything in return" This guy came and worked hard, he was the first to arrive and the last to leaveHe was the best employee in the place At 4 weeks one of the managers above resigned And they were looking for a replacement, guess who they chose?

Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</h2><br />

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</h2><br />
