This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>. Here's an example for the topic "Importance of Education":</p><p></p><p>TOPIC SENTENCE: Education is a fundamental aspect of human life.</p><p></p><p>OPENER/INTRODUCTION: Good day everyone. Today, I would like to talk about the importance of education.</p><p></p><p>BODY: Education is an essential ingredient in developing individuals and societies. It is through education that people gain knowledge, skills, and values that enable them to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. The benefits of education are vast, from personal growth to social and economic development. For one, education can improve people's lives by giving them a better understanding of the world around them. It allows them to make informed decisions and think critically. Moreover, education can unlock opportunities for people, such as higher-paid jobs, improved health outcomes, and increased participation in civic life.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why education is essential is that it builds character, instills values, and shapes attitudes. Education cultivates a sense of responsibility, respect for others, and a desire for lifelong learning. Also, it promotes tolerance, empathy, and understanding between cultures and communities. Education can foster social cohesion and harmony, which are critical in building peaceful and prosperous societies.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, education is an investment in the future. It is through education that we can address the complex challenges facing our world, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. By equipping people with the right skills and knowledge, education can help create a more sustainable and equitable world.</p><p></p><p>AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, education is crucial in shaping the future of individuals and communities. It empowers people to fulfill their potential, contribute to society, and make a positive impact on the world. Therefore, let us all recognize the importance of education and work to ensure that everyone has access to quality education and lifelong learning opportunities. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            22. For items 6-10, read the passage below to answer the following items. It is odd, but in our family, love always began with a fall of some form or another. This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals. Forward knowing that doing aomeng for acmeone else can be a spul save for the cray that we c Forward, knowing that we are caled to do everything we can for the good of others especially those that need hep the most Looking outward and moving forward-this is how we can bravely face the new world. With passion and purpose. With grit and resolve Win compassion and with courage Dear graduates, no matter what the future holds, stay on the side of courage and be nopetal for better days.
