The Third Commandment for Catholic Christians is usually formulated as                                      “Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day.”________________ 2. The first reason why the Jews designate the Sabbath day as holy and                                       consecrated to God is that it was the day God rested from His work of creation.________________ 3. The second reason why the Jews commemorate the Sabbath is that it was the                                       day they were set free from pleasures in Egypt after 400 years.________________ 4. Balance is needed between prayer and work on the Lord’s Day.________________ 5. Jesus violated the Sabbath Law when he healed the crippled woman on a                                      Sabbath day.________________ 6. Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath when he said “The Sabbath was made for                                      man, not man for the Sabbath.”________________ 7. The first reason why Christians made Saturday the Lord’s Day is that it was the                                      day Jesus rose from the dead. ________________ 8. The second reason why Christians celebrate Lord’s Day is that it was the day                                      Jesus descended upon Mary and the Apostles on Pentecost Sunday.________________ 9. The Holy Eucharist is a prayer of thanksgiving to God for life and our                                   salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.______________ 10. The Holy Eucharist is essentially our communal act of worship to the Lord                                     our God climaxing in the communal meal with our one Lord.​</a>

                                            • In cosmological philosophies introduced by the pre-Socratic philosophers, man is conceived to be part of the physical world. In this physical world, there is natural cosmological laws functioning as to how the physical elements change from within. Within the change, everything is determined consequently. If the case is such so, is man still conceived as “free” being able to take and make change according to his will, rather than passively subjected into the natural dynamics of this physical world?

6. God allowed Satan to have access to Adam and Eve at the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Read the quotation below and answer in your own words why it was necessary to test Adam and Eve.
"God might have
created man without the
power to transgress His law; He might have withheld the hand
of Adam from touching the forbidden fruit; but in that case man would have been, not a free moral
agent, but a mere automaton (robot). Without freedom of choice, his obedience would not have been
voluntary, but force. There could have been no development of character" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
49).</a>

“God might have created man without power to transgress his law; He might have withheld the hand of Adam from touching the forbidden fruit; but in that case man would have been, not a free moral agent, but a mere automation or a robot. Without freedom of choice, his obedience would not have been voluntary, but force. There could have been no development of character” ( Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 49)</a>

                            1. if man is free why is it that man is bounded by conscience​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yes becuase the man is free by conscience</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes. Because Conscience describes two things – what a person believes is right and how a person decides what is right. More than just 'gut instinct', our conscience is a 'moral muscle'. By informing us of our values and principles, it becomes the standard we use to judge whether or not our actions are ethical.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Correct me if I am wrong. If I'm wrong sorry</p><br />

                            2. why is man considered free?</h2><br />
                        Based on my understanding, a Man is considered to be free because of his "freedom" to have infinite choices in life. The way, what he wants to happen in his life, what he wants to do and what he wants to be. But a man is not "free" contrary to his nature, He cannot act outside the boundaries of his human nature. Through man's personal choices, he is aware for what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, in his choices, he is responsible for whatever action he takes.<br />

                        <p></p><p><strong> Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ who offered himself on the cross as a living victim, holy and pleasing to God, and whose blood has become the instrument of atonement for the sins of all men.

The Third Commandment for Catholic Christians is usually formulated as                                      “Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day.”________________ 2. The first reason why the Jews designate the Sabbath day as holy and                                       consecrated to God is that it was the day God rested from His work of creation.________________ 3. The second reason why the Jews commemorate the Sabbath is that it was the                                       day they were set free from pleasures in Egypt after 400 years.________________ 4. Balance is needed between prayer and work on the Lord’s Day.________________ 5. Jesus violated the Sabbath Law when he healed the crippled woman on a                                      Sabbath day.________________ 6. Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath when he said “The Sabbath was made for                                      man, not man for the Sabbath.”________________ 7. The first reason why Christians made Saturday the Lord’s Day is that it was the                                      day Jesus rose from the dead. ________________ 8. The second reason why Christians celebrate Lord’s Day is that it was the day                                      Jesus descended upon Mary and the Apostles on Pentecost Sunday.________________ 9.

In this physical world, there is natural cosmological laws functioning as to how the physical elements change from within. Within the change, everything is determined consequently. If the case is such so, is man still conceived as “free” being able to take and make change according to his will, rather than passively subjected into the natural dynamics of this physical world?

                        In the world of the Bible, a disciple was a person who followed a teacher, or rabbi, or master, or philosopher. The disciple desired to learn not only the teaching of the rabbi, but to imitate the practical details of their life.Decision: The act of making up one’s mind; a resolution; to determine by making a judgment.Disciple:  Any follower of Christ; a person who is a pupil or an adherent of the doctrines of another.Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God.” Jesus said that Peter was blessed as this was revealed to him by God.

"God might have
created man without the
power to transgress His law; He might have withheld the hand
of Adam from touching the forbidden fruit; but in that case man would have been, not a free moral
agent, but a mere automaton (robot). Without freedom of choice, his obedience would not have been
voluntary, but force. There could have been no development of character" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
49).</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Making judgments about whether a person is morally responsible for her behavior, and holding others and ourselves responsible for actions and the consequences of actions, is a fundamental and familiar part of our moral practices and our interpersonal relationships.
</p><p>
</p><p>The judgment that a person is morally responsible for her behavior involves—at least to a first approximation—attributing certain powers and capacities to that person, and viewing her behavior as arising (in the right way) from the fact that the person has, and has exercised, these powers and capacities. Whatever the correct account of the powers and capacities at issue (and canvassing different accounts is the task of this entry), their possession qualifies an agent as morally responsible in a general sense: that is, as one who may be morally responsible for particular exercises of agency. Normal adult human beings may possess the powers and capacities in question, and non-human animals, very young children, and those suffering from severe developmental disabilities or dementia (to give a few examples) are generally taken to lack them.
</p><p>
</p><p>To hold someone responsible involves—again, to a first approximation—responding to that person in ways that are made appropriate by the judgment that she is morally responsible. These responses often constitute instances of moral praise or moral blame (though there may be reason to allow for morally responsible behavior that is neither praiseworthy nor blameworthy: see McKenna 2012: 16–17 and M. Zimmerman 1988: 61–62). Blame is a response that may follow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible for behavior that is wrong or bad, and praise is a response that may follow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible for behavior that is right or good.
</p><p>
</p><p>It should be noted at the outset that the above schema, while useful, may be misleading in certain respects. For one thing, it suggests a correspondence and symmetry between praise and blame that may not exist. The two are certainly asymmetrical insofar as the attention given to blame far exceeds that given to praise. One reason for this is that blameworthiness, unlike praiseworthiness, is often taken to involve liability to a sanction. Thus, articulating the conditions of blameworthiness may seem to theorists the more pressing matter. Perhaps for related reasons, there is a richer language for expressing blame than praise (Watson 1996 [2004: 283]), and “blame” finds its way into idioms for which there is no ready parallel employing “praise”: compare “S is to blame for x” and “S is to praise for x”. Note, as well, that “holding responsible” is itself not a neutral expression: it typically arises in blaming contexts (Watson 1996 [2004: 284]). Additionally, there may be asymmetries in the contexts in which praise and blame are appropriate: private blame is a more familiar phenomenon than private praise (Coates &amp; Tognazzini 2013a), and while minor wrongs may reasonably earn blame, minimally decent behavior often seems insufficient for praise (see Eshleman 2014 for this and other differences between praise and blame). Finally, the widespread assumption that praiseworthiness and blameworthiness are at least symmetrical in terms of the capacities they require has also been questioned (Nelkin 2008, 2011; Wolf 1980, 1990). Like most work on moral responsibility, this entry will tend to focus on the negative side of the phenomenon; for more, see the entry on blame.

This will drive one to sadness, dispair, then hopeless, rage, and finally, insanity. That's because removing one's free will is not giving the person a chance to choose how his or her life goes, and this frustration leads one to end up walking the path of self-destruction. </p><br />
