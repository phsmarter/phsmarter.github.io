A travelogue requires the writer to describe his or her travel experiences vividly and create imagery in the mind of the readers. Blogs are only intended for food concepts. 2. An autobiography uses third person point of view. A biography utilizes the first person point of view.3. Personal and true narratives are based on real life events. Personal narratives focus on a topic through the lens of the personal experiences of the narrator. 4. Reflective essays focus on narrating someone else's life. A travel experience once it is published in a personal website is considered a travel blog. 5. Biographies and autobiographies focus on single events in life. Testimonios contain an account of experiences of a person shared by another person. 6. A reportage presents facts in a literary way. Reflective essays can be crafted based on any moment in one's life that instills lessons. 7.Reflective essays, testimonies, and personal narratives are autobiographical in nature. A true narrative only tells personal experiences8. A written work is called a personal narrative if the author shares his or her experience of an event in his or her life. Someone else's moment in his or her life written by another person is a true narrative.​</a>

The project, which stands for “Learning, Innovation, and Personal Development through Entrepreneurship,” aims to empower young individuals to become entrepreneurs and create sustainable businesses.</p><p></p><p>From the start, I was excited but also a bit nervous about what was to come. I had never considered myself an entrepreneur, and I wasn’t sure if I had the skills and knowledge to create a successful business. However, as the project progressed, I found myself becoming more and more engaged and invested in the process.</p><p></p><p>Through a series of workshops and mentoring sessions, I learned about business planning, marketing strategies, and financial management. I also had the opportunity to work with a team of like-minded individuals who were just as passionate about making their business dreams a reality. Together, we brainstormed ideas, developed prototypes, and even presented our business plan to a panel of judges.</p><p></p><p>The experience was both challenging and rewarding. I faced many obstacles and faced many moments of self-doubt, but I also found myself growing and developing in ways I never thought possible. The project helped me realize that I am capable of achieving my goals and that I have the potential to be a successful entrepreneur. It also taught me that I am not alone in this journey and that there is a supportive community of people who want to help me succeed.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Project LIPAY has been an enriching and transformative experience that I will always cherish. It has taught me invaluable skills and has helped me to discover my true potential. I am forever grateful for the opportunity and I am excited to see where my entrepreneurial journey will take me.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The use of active or passive voice is a fundamental distinction in English, and one that causes trouble for many writers – including native English speakers!</p><p></p><p>Growing up in American schools, students are often taught that they should avoid the passive voice because it is “weak.” However, the choice between active and passive is actually quite nuanced.</p><p></p><p>Depending on the ideas you are trying to express and the conventions of the discipline/journal in which you are writing, the passive voice can be an appropriate, sophisticated, and even preferable choice over the active voice. Nevertheless, the active voice is sometimes a far better choice, and you may use both in the same article depending on the context and content of your sentences and the section of your paper you are writing.</p><br />

                        <p>Yes I already did experience an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>I was 13 years old back then. I was sleeping in my house, having bunked the republic day celebrations at school. The 2nd term examinations had just ended a day earlier and I just wanted to sleep. My parents were invited at a family friend's place for breakfast and they allowed me to take a holiday and rest in.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly the whole house started shaking. I tried getting up but couldn't. My sister shouted from the other room to come out. I made my way out of my room with great difficulty. The house was in a mess. All the kitchen items were on the floor. All the food that was kept in the fridge spilled out. I met my sister near the hall and along with my grandfather we came out of the house.</p><p></p><p>The moment we came out we heard a big loud sound and we saw the adjacent building had come down. I started crying. I had friends in that building and I was too much in shock to understand what was hapoening.</p><p></p><p>Just then my sister asked,</p><p></p><p>“Do you know where mummy papa have gone?”</p><p></p><p>I replied in the negative. My heart started racing. All the people were out on the streets and nobody wanted to go back inside. My sister suggested she would go look for our parents and told me to be strong and look after my grandfather.</p><p></p><p>Before my sister could leave we saw our parents returning. Thankfully they were alright. The few things that are still etched in my memory after so many years are,</p><p></p><p>People risking their lives to take out debris and trying to help out people who were stuck and couldn't move. In one such instance there was a man who kept talking to a woman stuck inside till the fire brigade came to rescue her. She had lost hope as she her husband lay beside her dead. The man kept motivating her that there is more to life.</p><p>Then there were people who rummaged inside the debris just to find some cash or jewellery. People took whatever valuable items they could find.</p><p>A friend of mine lost her right hand when a whole part of the lift fell upon her. She was rescued 24 hours later.</p><p>Families who were lucky to have survived helped others selflessly. Food was shared among those who were waiting for their loved one to make it out of the debris alive.</p><p>A pregnant woman in our locality had twins on that day. She named them ‘Erica’ and ‘Eric’. They must be 16 year olds now.</p><p>There were stories about people who escaped death by few seconds. A man was pushed and forced by his wife to go and wash his car. The moment he stepped out of his house he felt the earthquake and his whole building was razed to the ground.</p><p>Many pet owners shared their experiences of how they were warned by the pets to come out of their houses even before the earthquake happened.</p><p>An NRI couple in our neighbourhood had come to India after 20 years. They died while their relatives survived.</p><p>All the public gardens and parks were packed with people at night who were to too scared to go back in their houses to sleep.</p><p>My whole family slept in the hall, close to the main door with an emergency bag ready. It contained 2 pairs of clothes each, cash and jewellery that we had and all the documents needed.</p><p>We were the lucky ones who had not lost anything or anyone. I can't describe how it changed me. I had a new found respect for my life. At just 13 I realised I was lucky enough to be alive. And also for the fact that I still had my family with me. Family is everything.</p><br />

Here are some guide questions:</p>Was there a time you were discriminated because of how you look, the way you dress or you skin color?
