                                             The next week Mother become very ill.She was rushed to the hospital. I was allowed to see her only after a day Father said she was too weak to even speak. When l come in her hospital room i saw her hugging a doll . An awfully ugly little doll binked several times and raised its slimy little  hands to Mother. My Mother. What's THAT?lwrinkled my nose in disgust. Why honey, she's your little baby sister. You are a big brother now! And she hugged up again! Yuck My lips curled and i ran out out of the room. I wiped the tears that rolled down my cheeks. I was jealous. My father found me and scolded me. He said I should go and apologize to Mother for upsetting her After some spanking. I obeyed. I went book to her room "You're a liar. - you told me you love me. I do, sweetie.. Then, why? Aren't shouted at Mother. you happy you have a sister to play with a now "No." And that was that, Mother tried hard to establish ties between the ugly doll and me. But really don't ike it. 's no fun at all, not like Mother, I can't cimb trees, it can't run fast, it wets the bed it keeps on crying every time it trips and.it's always with Mother. It's stealing Mother away from me. Mother had two more ugly dolls the next year. She said they're "eye-dental things. Maybe because their eyes and teeth look the same. In fact, they looked like so much that I can't tell one ugly doll from another. I often saw Mother take different colored stones. Father said it should stop Mother from making more ugly dolls. But I didn't think that it worked because in the next seven years, nine screaming ugly dolls, some with long hair, others with short hair, surrounded me. Some are colored like chocolates, others milky, and still some are the color of coffee. There are thin ums and fat 'ums. but all of them are annoyingly noisy. And unbearably ugly, They even drool like my dog. Tagpi. I despised them all and I promised myself that when I grow up. i would develop a medicine to stop mothers from having ugly dolls. The witch doctors and faith healers in our town couldn't stop Mother from moking ugly dols. but I will. And now have grown up. In my quest to stop mothers from making ugly babies (my father threatened to stop me from schooling if i continue calling Mother's girls as ugly dolls. so now! call them ugly babies instead). I ended up in medical school. I become on obstetrician-gynecologist. I'm on my way to the delivery room for my first time to deliver an ugly baby. I still loathe babies. Ugly dolls that they are. Five hours later, I tapped the back of the newborn and a cry is heard. I stared at the helpless thing not realizing that tears are rolling down my cheeks again. This time, I smiled.

                                            Read the excerpt from the story of a Nigerian girl and answer the questions that follow:I am from Bida, in Minna, Niger state. I am 19 years old. My father had two wives who didn't produce sons for him so he married my mum as his third wife. After my elder sister, myself and my younger sister, my mom gave birth to a boy.From where I come from it is viewed as a sign of weakness if a man has no sons. This is why my dad had to have a son at all cost. In the village we stay in huts which are in compounds. Each man would have a compound and he and each of his wives would stay in separate huts within the compound.I started school early, I don't really remember when. What I do remember is that when I was about 4 years old my father came to the school I was attending with a cane and beat me terribly. I remember that I had not done anything wrong and even my mother didn't know why he did that.My dad felt it was "useless" to educate female children. I continued school. He repeated the beatings many times. When he did it the last time he insisted that my name be removed from the registers, exercise books and so on. School authorities couldn't do much, he is my father. Though my teacher at that time tried to convince him but he didn't agree.Questions:1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Where did the story happen?3. What does his father think about girls going toschool?4. With all the circumstances the Nigerian girl experienced, and his dad's thought of "useless to educate female children" what kind of issue is she into?5. What is the message of the story?​</a>

                            4.  The next week Mother become very ill.She was rushed to the hospital. I was allowed to see her only after a day Father said she was too weak to even speak. When l come in her hospital room i saw her hugging a doll . An awfully ugly little doll binked several times and raised its slimy little  hands to Mother. My Mother. What's THAT?lwrinkled my nose in disgust. Why honey, she's your little baby sister. You are a big brother now! And she hugged up again! Yuck My lips curled and i ran out out of the room. I wiped the tears that rolled down my cheeks. I was jealous. My father found me and scolded me. He said I should go and apologize to Mother for upsetting her After some spanking. I obeyed. I went book to her room "You're a liar. - you told me you love me. I do, sweetie.. Then, why? Aren't shouted at Mother. you happy you have a sister to play with a now "No." And that was that, Mother tried hard to establish ties between the ugly doll and me. But really don't ike it. 's no fun at all, not like Mother, I can't cimb trees, it can't run fast, it wets the bed it keeps on crying every time it trips and.it's always with Mother. It's stealing Mother away from me. Mother had two more ugly dolls the next year. She said they're "eye-dental things. Maybe because their eyes and teeth look the same. In fact, they looked like so much that I can't tell one ugly doll from another. I often saw Mother take different colored stones. Father said it should stop Mother from making more ugly dolls. But I didn't think that it worked because in the next seven years, nine screaming ugly dolls, some with long hair, others with short hair, surrounded me. Some are colored like chocolates, others milky, and still some are the color of coffee. There are thin ums and fat 'ums. but all of them are annoyingly noisy. And unbearably ugly, They even drool like my dog. Tagpi. I despised them all and I promised myself that when I grow up. i would develop a medicine to stop mothers from having ugly dolls. The witch doctors and faith healers in our town couldn't stop Mother from moking ugly dols. but I will. And now have grown up. In my quest to stop mothers from making ugly babies (my father threatened to stop me from schooling if i continue calling Mother's girls as ugly dolls. so now! call them ugly babies instead). I ended up in medical school. I become on obstetrician-gynecologist. I'm on my way to the delivery room for my first time to deliver an ugly baby. I still loathe babies. Ugly dolls that they are. Five hours later, I tapped the back of the newborn and a cry is heard. I stared at the helpless thing not realizing that tears are rolling down my cheeks again. This time, I smiled.

This is why my dad had to have a son at all cost. In the village we stay in huts which are in compounds. Each man would have a compound and he and each of his wives would stay in separate huts within the compound.I started school early, I don't really remember when. What I do remember is that when I was about 4 years old my father came to the school I was attending with a cane and beat me terribly. I remember that I had not done anything wrong and even my mother didn't know why he did that.My dad felt it was "useless" to educate female children. I continued school. He repeated the beatings many times. When he did it the last time he insisted that my name be removed from the registers, exercise books and so on. School authorities couldn't do much, he is my father. Though my teacher at that time tried to convince him but he didn't agree.Questions:1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Where did the story happen?3. What does his father think about girls going toschool?4.
