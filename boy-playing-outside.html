One Saturday morning, the boy's parents had to do the marketing. Before they left, Mr. Felipe instructed the two boys, "Alex, it is your turn now to clean the house. Isidro, please don't forget to clean the yard and cut the grass there. When you are done with your chores, you may go and play with your friends."As soon as Mother and Father left, Alex started cleaning the house. Isidro had a plan. He thought to himself," It will take Mother and Father some time at the market. I will play first then come back to do my chores." Then off he ran to play with his friends outside. Isidro enjoyed playing so much. He did not notice Father and Mother had already arrived. He only hurried hone after Alex had called him. "So, only Alex did what he was asked to do," Father said. "Well, that means only Alex gets to play for the rest of the day. While you, Isidro, will finish your chores and stay home the rest of the day."Isidro felt bad, but he knew his parents were right. He promised to himself that whenever he has work to do, he will do it promptly and do it wellAnswer 1. Which of the boys used his time wisely? 2. Was Mr. Felipe right in punishing Isidro? Why do you think did he punish Isidro and reward Alex? 3. How would you feel if you were Alaex? Isidro? ​</a>
