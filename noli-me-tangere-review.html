                                            Rizal’s Letter: To the Young Women of Malolos(excerpt)When I wrote Noli Me Tangere, I asked myself whether bravery was a common thing in the young women of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seem to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so called “spiritual fathers” (as if the spirit or soul had any father other than God), due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. They seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.However, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its young women, except one called Emila [Emilia Tiongson, whom Rizal met in 1887], and her I knew by name only.Now that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipina stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosarios, and grimy scapularies [religious garment showing devotion], but in a spotless conduct, firm intention, and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the little tin god, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each individual reason and a will of his or her own to distinguish the just from the unjust; all were born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another your thoughts. And, why should you submit to another your thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?THIS SUBJECT IS "21ST CENTURY LITERATURE"Question:Base on the first paragraph, how did jose rizal describe the filipino wowen?​</a>

                            3. How to write a novel review about noli me tangere?</h2><br />
                        For the novel that I have chosen to review, I had my doubts, as it’s a novel of Jose Rizal. In school, my teacher assigned us to memorize Rizal’s Noli Me Tangere that was written in Tagalog. Now, I realized that the undertaking is a challenge if I lack the interest in reading the novel. It worried me more, as the front cover didn’t satisfy me—it’s not attractive, but you’ll probably will think otherwise. After reading the novel, I couldn’t believe the emotion that it stirred in me.<br /><br /><br /><br />Just a little background, Rizal wrote Noli Me Tangere in Europe from 1882 to 1887 and published it in Berlin, Germany. Jose Rizal, son of a prosperous family in the Philippines, is educated in the best schools and universities in Manila and Europe. During that time his country is under the Spanish colonization; and so, the novel is set during those times where people are experiencing oppression from Spain—or at least the imperfect government they had back then.<br /><br />Noli Me Tangere tells a story of Crisostomo Ibarra, the son of the wealthiest man Don Rafael Ibarra, who just came from Europe. Although a righteous man in a country dominated with Christianity, Ibarra faces challenges—like those of his own country caused his arch enemy Father Damaso.<br /><br />Father Damaso is a Franciscan friar who talks too much with a great deal gesticulation. Throughout the whole plot, this friar makes things complicated for Ibarra, his novel undertakings, and his love the friar’s goddaughter, Maria Clara.<br /><br />Maria Clara, on the other hand, is the paragon of beauty and purity. She is loved by many—especially her godfather is fond of her. I almost imagined butterflies and Sampaguita petals around her when the name Maria Clara is mentioned. She was arranged to be married to the heir of Don Rafael Ibarra.<br /><br />In this translated version, Harold Augenbraum managed to show the masterful command of the language. Noli Me Tangere is detailed in telling a story. But with the profound intellect of Jose Rizal, I somehow had to slow down my phase of reading to prevent overlooking some important details. Also, the novel is littered with foreign and unfamiliar words that might somehow confuse you, the reader. Fear not, though, as there are notes at back for further explanations of these terms used during that time.<br /><br />The pages of this novel are filled with hatred, hate, and torture which led the disadvantage people to unite against tyranny and oppression. Also throughout the plot, the indios, a derogatory term for the inhabitants of the Philippines, are portrayed to be abused—physically and emotionally—by its colonizer.<br /><br />Finally, the message that I got from Noli Me Tangere is that a country is like an organism, and the government is the vital part: State, Territory, Government, and People. This gargantuan organism suffers from a cancer that slowly deteriorates and weakens the strength of its organization. It may require a treatment to sustain, yet it deteriorates its vitality.<br /><br />You may or may not disagree on my opinion about this book, but truly this novel leaves a lot of room for interpretation. If you wanted to read a book rich in history, culture, wisdom, legends and maybe a little bit of romance—Maria Clara made me cry on the later part, then I recommend this book for you.<br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Answer:</p><p>➡️The author of the story "Jose Rizal" aims to dedicate the novel to our country,Noli Me Tangere is basically a love story,has a setting of 19th century philippines while in the midst of latter years of spanish colonialism.Its a love story not only two individual Crisostomo Ibarra and Maria Clara de los Santos , but also between persons and the motherland</p><p></p><p>➡️I see that Crisostomo Ibarra influenced by his European education , he sought to improve the country , as part of this is to show the true condition of our country society that its tissue was eaten up by a social cancer specially the corruption and abuse of power caused by many of the friar and spanish administration officials.As speaking of friars , Rizal was simply referring to Padre Damaso and Padre Salvi who were hypocritical and corrupt and becomes untouchable because of their power.On the other hand Crisostomo Ibarra applies aleman values on introducing himself tp the somen,while he was away Don Rafael and Capitan Tiago betrothed him to Maria Clara which started their relationship</p><p></p><p>➡️I was saddened to Maria Clara's situation because it was full of unfair circumstances and she has a lot to sacrifice which the biggest is she had to betray her lover Crisostomo Ibarra just to prevent her true biological father Padre Damaso from being revealed.Although Maria Clara decided to enter the convent as a nun , in a fit of apparent insanity Maria Clara fell ill and died a few days later in 1895,which makes the love story tragic</p><p></p><p>MAMATAY NA KUMOPYA NG HINDI NAGHEHEART SYAKA RATE</p><p>de jk lng pero baka nman ang hirap kaya itype</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            10. Rizal’s Letter: To the Young Women of Malolos(excerpt)When I wrote Noli Me Tangere, I asked myself whether bravery was a common thing in the young women of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seem to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so called “spiritual fathers” (as if the spirit or soul had any father other than God), due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. They seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.However, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its young women, except one called Emila [Emilia Tiongson, whom Rizal met in 1887], and her I knew by name only.Now that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipina stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosarios, and grimy scapularies [religious garment showing devotion], but in a spotless conduct, firm intention, and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the little tin god, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each individual reason and a will of his or her own to distinguish the just from the unjust; all were born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another your thoughts. And, why should you submit to another your thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?THIS SUBJECT IS "21ST CENTURY LITERATURE"Question:Base on the first paragraph, how did jose rizal describe the filipino wowen?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In the first paragraph of the letter "To the Young Women of Malolos," Jose Rizal described the young women of his time as having agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but with an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so-called "spiritual fathers." He also remarked that they seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap. Rizal observed that the young women of his time lacked bravery and seemed to be living in servitude, which was due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. He was looking for young women who would come up to his ideal, and at first, he thought there were only a few.</p><br />

Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not) (1887) by José Rizal is such a book, for although its author advocated reform not independence, the novel was so instrumental in articulating a Filipino identity that it provoked resistance against the Spanish colonial regime. Ostensibly it is a love story, but one set against a backdrop of repression and violence. Rizal would be dead within ten years, executed by firing squad in Manila.
