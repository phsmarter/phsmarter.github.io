                                            Please read this text afterwards, answer the questions that follows.
 There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child
make healthy, life-long choices:
1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or
otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken
influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group
is immense. 
2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one
or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This
could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’
types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental
maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions. 
3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior
centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager
hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks
at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a
position of having to make an on-the-spot decision. 
4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still
exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen
overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the
gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 
5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral
code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the
actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of
following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to
say no to negative peer pressure. 
6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are
healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer
group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced
to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young
teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account.

Read it carefully and extract information using Paraphrase, Summary, and Precís.There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child make healthy, life-long choices:1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group is immense.2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’ types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions.3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a position of having to make an on-the-spot decision.4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person.

Be guided by the steps in writing a good arch title. This research paper analyzes the correlation that exists between sleep and high school students' performance in class. To answer this question, we compared academic performance against questionnaires that detailed the sleep schedules of 122 high school students. Our results showed that there was a positive correlation between poor academic performance and getting fewer than 8 hours of sleep a night. The results also revealed that poor sleep patterns can lead to concentration and behavior issues. The implications of this study could be used to promote high schoolers sleeping at least 8 hours a night.

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</a>

Read it carefully and extract information using Paraphrase, Summary, and Precís.There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child make healthy, life-long choices1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group is immense.2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’ types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions.3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a position of having to make an on-the-spot decision.4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to say no to negative peer pressure.6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account.​</a>

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

                            8. Please read this text afterwards, answer the questions that follows.
 There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child
make healthy, life-long choices:
1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or
otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken
influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group
is immense. 
2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one
or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This
could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’
types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental
maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions. 
3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior
centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager
hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks
at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a
position of having to make an on-the-spot decision. 
4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still
exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen
overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the
gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 
5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral
code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the
actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of
following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to
say no to negative peer pressure. 
6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are
healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer
group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced
to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young
teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account. 
1. Why do you think Peer Pressure is a good topic to read and share to
others?
2. Explain how the following skills help you in summarizing:
a. Getting the main idea:
__________________________________________________________________
b. Noting supporting details:
_________________________________________________________________
c. Paraphrasing:
__________________________________________________________________
d. Identifying text development:

e. Using correct grammatical features:

Read it carefully and extract information using Paraphrase, Summary, and Precís.There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child make healthy, life-long choices:1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group is immense.2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’ types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions.3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a position of having to make an on-the-spot decision.4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to say no to negative peer pressure.6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account.1. Choose one paragraph and write a paraphrase.2.

Be guided by the steps in writing a good arch title. This research paper analyzes the correlation that exists between sleep and high school students' performance in class. To answer this question, we compared academic performance against questionnaires that detailed the sleep schedules of 122 high school students. Our results showed that there was a positive correlation between poor academic performance and getting fewer than 8 hours of sleep a night. The results also revealed that poor sleep patterns can lead to concentration and behavior issues. The implications of this study could be used to promote high schoolers sleeping at least 8 hours a night.

                            18. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</h2><br />

Read it carefully and extract information using Paraphrase, Summary, and Precís.There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child make healthy, life-long choices1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group is immense.2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’ types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions.3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a position of having to make an on-the-spot decision.4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to say no to negative peer pressure.6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account.​</h2><br />

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."
