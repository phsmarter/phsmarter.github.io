                                            How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</a>

In addition during the Christmas season, families are closer. It doesn't matter how extravagant the festivity Bor how much food is on someone's plate, what matters the most is the presence of our loved ones. Knowing that this season can bring people together is one of the biggest blessings we could ever receive. To begin with the spirit of Christmas brings a different feeling to everyone; young or old, rich or poor. The excitement that sparkles in the children's eyes upon receiving the long-awaited gift from their ninang and ninong is truly something remarkable. **It is the season to be jolly!"

                            2. Write an essay about biases that you observed based on Rich vs. poor​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rich and Poor</p><p>Variety is the spice of life. Well God didn’t create people equal, by that I mean, He didn’t give them same level and social class. Some strive to be rich and work hard to accomplish their goals, and some go through hardships to have what they want in life. Some live a life of needy and poverty, and some live a life of luxury and opulence. Some live life of thrifty and some live a life of lavishness. Some sleep on cold floors and some sleep on a bed of roses. Lastly, both rich and poor differ in social status, income, and over all life’s great opportunities.</p><p>They need each other like tea and sugar. Without poor people, no one would have worked and everyone would stretch their legs and relax like a king. But even kings have servants who provide them their needs. Despite riches having what poor people dream of, they still they need poor people who can do what their pride won 't let them do, such as wealthy wives won 't cook for their husbands and need housekeepers. As also housekeepers need money to live, so both rich and the poor are parasite to each other, mutually benefiting from each other. Even though, rich have a better life than poor and they have good social status, high income, and better privileges in education and career opportunities, they need poor people and it 's their part of their success. Poor people need rich people, because rich people are their motivation to work hard to be rich and dream the life of wealthy people. Poor work hard to achieve their goals and get out the life of poverty. On the other hand, rich people need poor people to dream higher, and never become poor. As an example, once a rich person was once a poor, they 'll never want to live the life in their past. They tested what 's it 's to be poor and have nothing. The experience of their past life is an example of how poverty is bitter</p><br />

                            3. SURORTLINER Performance Test: Write an essay on the issue of social stratification in the Philippines: N "The effects of Rich and Poor social status in the Philippines and how should this be addressed​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The effects of this rich-poor divide are far-reaching and deeply felt. Those at the bottom of the social ladder often lack access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential services, while those at the top enjoy privileges and opportunities that are out of reach for many. This leads to a perpetuation of poverty and inequality, as those who are born into disadvantaged circumstances are often unable to break out of them due to a lack of resources and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>One of the most pressing issues related to social stratification in the Philippines is the lack of upward mobility. Those who are born into wealthy families are much more likely to succeed and achieve financial stability, while those born into poverty are often trapped there for their entire lives. This lack of mobility has far-reaching consequences for both individuals and society as a whole, as it reinforces a sense of hopelessness and a lack of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>To address this issue, it is essential that the government and other institutions take steps to address the root causes of poverty and inequality. This includes investing in education and training programs, providing access to healthcare and other essential services, and implementing policies that promote economic growth and development. Additionally, it is important to address issues of corruption and ensure that the wealth of the country is distributed fairly and equitably.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, addressing the issue of social stratification in the Philippines will require a concerted effort from all sectors of society. By working together and taking action to address the root causes of poverty and inequality, it is possible to create a more inclusive and just society for all.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            18. How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Okay I will revise your essay.</strong><p>Poverty is a complex societal issue that affects individuals, families, communities, and nations. It is defined as the inability to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and education. However, poverty is much more than just a lack of money. It is hunger, sickness, unemployment, lack of access to education and healthcare, and living one day at a time. Therefore, poverty requires urgent attention from everyone, and it is not just the problem of the poor individual, but also the entire nation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, many people have the misconception that poverty is a choice made by the poor. They believe that poor people should just work harder to improve their lives. However, this is not always the case. In many situations, the poor lack access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities, which makes it difficult for them to escape poverty. It is not fair to judge people in poverty without understanding the structural and systemic issues that contribute to their plight.</p><p></p><p>To eradicate poverty, effective measures must be implemented by the government and society at large. These measures should focus on providing access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities to the poor. The eradication of poverty is essential for sustainable and inclusive growth for people, society, country, and the economy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a societal issue that requires the attention of everyone. It is not just the problem of the poor individual, but also the entire nation. To eradicate poverty, we must address the systemic issues that contribute to it and provide access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities for the poor. It is only by working together that we can create a world without poverty.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>Here are some tips on how to revise this essay on poverty:</strong><p></p>Check for clarity: Make sure your ideas are clear and easy to understand.

                        International interdependence has been a driving force behind the rise of globalization. The interconnectedness of economies, cultures, and societies has led to an unprecedented level of global integration. The world has become more interconnected through advances in technology, transportation, and communication. This has allowed for the exchange of goods, services, and ideas across borders, leading to increased economic growth and cultural exchange.<br /><br />The rise of globalization can be traced back to the end of World War II. The establishment of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods system created a framework for international cooperation and economic stability. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was also established to reduce barriers to trade and promote economic growth. These institutions laid the foundation for the globalization that we see today.<br /><br />The growth of international trade has been a major driver of globalization. The reduction of trade barriers and the opening up of markets has allowed for the exchange of goods and services across borders. This has led to increased economic growth and job creation in many countries. However, it has also led to the outsourcing of jobs and the displacement of workers in some industries.<br /><br />Globalization has affected both rich and poor nations in different ways. Rich nations have benefited from increased access to new markets and cheaper goods. They have also been able to outsource jobs to countries with lower labor costs. Poor nations have benefited from increased investment and access to new technologies. However, they have also been vulnerable to exploitation by multinational corporations and have often been left behind in the global economy.<br /><br />The rise of globalization has also had a significant impact on culture. The exchange of ideas and cultural practices has led to a greater understanding and appreciation of different cultures. However, it has also led to the homogenization of culture, as Western culture has become dominant in many parts of the world.<br /><br />The benefits of globalization are not evenly distributed. While some countries have seen significant economic growth and development, others have been left behind. The gap between rich and poor nations has widened, and income inequality has increased within many countries. The benefits of globalization have also been concentrated in the hands of a small elite, while the majority of people have seen little improvement in their standard of living.<br /><br />Despite these challenges, globalization has brought many benefits. It has led to increased economic growth, job creation, and cultural exchange. It has also created opportunities for people to connect with others from around the world and to learn from different cultures. Globalization has also helped to reduce poverty and improve living standards in many countries.<br /><br />In conclusion, international interdependence has been a driving force behind the rise of globalization. The interconnectedness of economies, cultures, and societies has led to increased economic growth and cultural exchange. However, globalization has also led to the outsourcing of jobs, the displacement of workers, and the widening of the gap between rich and poor nations. While the benefits of globalization are not evenly distributed, it has brought many benefits and has helped to reduce poverty and improve living standards in many countries. Overall, the benefits of globalization outweigh the challenges, and it is up to policymakers to ensure that the benefits are shared more equitably.<br />

                            22. Below are pictures presented depicting various types of community-based sociological perspectives (e.g., rural, urban, slum, subdivision, poor, middle class, rich, industrial, agricultural, etc.). Write one-page essay comparing and contrasting the pictures​</h2><br />
                        <p>Community-based sociological perspectives refer to the ways in which people interact, relate, and organize themselves in different communities. These perspectives are shaped by various factors such as social class, economic status, culture, geography, and history. In this essay, we will compare and contrast some of the community-based sociological perspectives, including rural, urban, slum, subdivision, poor, middle class, rich, industrial, and agricultural perspectives.</p><p></p><p>Rural communities are characterized by low population density, agricultural activities, and traditional social structures. People in rural areas are often self-sufficient, and their lives are closely tied to the land. In contrast, urban communities are characterized by high population density, diverse economic activities, and complex social structures. Urban areas are centers of commerce, industry, and culture, and people in these areas are often more mobile and socially diverse.</p><p></p><p>Slum communities are typically found in urban areas and are characterized by poverty, poor housing, and lack of basic services. People living in slums often face social exclusion, marginalization, and discrimination. Subdivision communities, on the other hand, are typically found in suburban areas and are characterized by gated communities, private amenities, and exclusivity. People living in subdivisions often have high levels of income and social status, and they prioritize privacy and security.</p><p></p><p>Poor communities refer to communities where people live in poverty, struggle to make ends meet, and lack access to basic services. These communities are often located in both rural and urban areas. In contrast, middle-class communities are characterized by stability, moderate levels of income, and access to basic services. People living in middle-class communities often value education, home ownership, and social mobility.</p><p></p><p>Rich communities are characterized by wealth, high levels of consumption, and access to luxury amenities. People living in rich communities often have access to exclusive education, health care, and cultural events. Industrial communities, on the other hand, are characterized by large-scale production, manufacturing, and economic growth. People living in industrial communities often have stable jobs, but they may also face health and environmental risks.</p><p></p><p>Finally, agricultural communities are characterized by the production of crops and livestock, and people in these communities often live in rural areas. These communities are often tightly knit, and people prioritize their relationship with the land and their families.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, community-based sociological perspectives are diverse and complex. Each community has its own unique characteristics, challenges, and opportunities. By understanding these perspectives, we can better appreciate the diversity of human experiences and work towards creating more equitable and sustainable communities.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> <strong>s</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>g</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong> </strong><strong>g</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>.</strong></p><br />

Are rich people really happy because they have everything? Are poor people really sad because they don't have anything? Explain. your answer.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:1.Socioeconomic status is the position of an individual or group on the socioeconomic scale, which is determined by a combination of social and economic factors such as income, amount and kind of education, type and prestige of occupation, place of residence, and—in some societies or parts of society—ethnic origin or ... 2.iin fact, new research shows that richer and poorer people are generally as happy as each other. Where they differ is in their level of sadness: higher-income individuals are markedly less sad on a daily basis.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: Thanks</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. There are various ways to identify the economic status of one's family. Here are some common methods:</p><p></p><p>Income: One of the most common indicators of economic status is income. Income can be determined by looking at the amount of money that a family earns from various sources such as salaries, wages, bonuses, and investments.</p><p></p><p>Education: Education can also be a good indicator of economic status. Families with higher levels of education tend to have higher paying jobs and better access to resources.</p><p></p><p>Occupation: The occupation of the head of the household or the primary breadwinner can also give an indication of economic status. Certain occupations such as doctors, lawyers, and engineers tend to have higher incomes than others.</p><p></p><p>Assets: The assets that a family owns can also provide an indication of economic status. Assets may include real estate, vehicles, stocks, bonds, and other investments.</p><p></p><p>Living conditions: The living conditions of a family can also give an indication of economic status. Families living in larger houses or in expensive neighborhoods may have a higher economic status.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that these indicators should not be used in isolation and should be considered together to get a more accurate picture of a family's economic status.</p><p></p><p>2. The relationship between wealth and happiness is complex and not straightforward. While it is true that having a certain level of financial security can alleviate some of the stresses and anxieties associated with poverty, it does not necessarily guarantee happiness.</p><p></p><p>Research has shown that once basic needs are met, such as food, shelter, and safety, additional wealth has diminishing returns in terms of happiness. This means that beyond a certain point, having more money does not necessarily lead to greater happiness. In fact, studies have shown that some extremely wealthy individuals experience higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression than their less affluent counterparts.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, being poor can certainly contribute to a sense of sadness, stress, and uncertainty, as financial struggles can make it difficult to meet basic needs and achieve long-term goals. However, many individuals who are living in poverty still find joy and contentment in their lives, as they may have strong relationships, a sense of purpose, and a deep appreciation for the simple things in life.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, happiness is a complex and multifaceted emotion that is influenced by a wide range of factors, including personal values, life circumstances, and social support. While wealth can contribute to happiness in certain ways, it is by no means a guarantee, and individuals who are living in poverty can still find meaning and fulfillment in their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
