                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All around the world, smoking has long been a habit. However, smoking cigarettes used to be quite common, well-known as a hip recreational substance, and widely accepted by society worldwide. Due to the numerous health concerns associated with smoking, smoking is less prevalent and more limited nowadays. People are more educated and aware of the dangers of smoking now than ever before. As a result, smoking's appeal has drastically decreased during the previous ten years. Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is more than just an addiction. You can lose approximately 13.8 minutes of your life for every cigarette you smoke. You can lose about 4.6 hours of your life for every pack of cigarettes you smoke. Smoking is expensive, although many of us may not be aware of this or pay attention to it.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I thinks this is already around 700 words srry..</p><br />
