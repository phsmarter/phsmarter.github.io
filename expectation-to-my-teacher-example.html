                                            What's More
I always remember what my teacher in Values Education
said in her class one afternoon. She said that when we are born,
we do not have yet the set of values expected from us because
we learn them from our parents or adults who raise us. Yes, she
was right because we learn these from our elders. We learn by
examples and by watching or observing them at home.
Yes, the family plays a greater role in shaping a child into a
responsible and productive adult. The family is a child's first role
model. They do not only set examples but they give every child an
opportunity to make important choices and decisions. Parents are
the child's first teachers and whatever the child learns at home
will forever be carried on and handed down to the generations to
come.

                                            I am a typical teenager. I love basketball, music, movies andfood. However, there are many concerns and worries. Oftentimes,am thinking about my basketball games, my studies and myteachers, my family, my friends and of course, the girl I admire. I ama happy kid but I have hang ups as well.I love my parents. No question about it. I have great respectwith my great elders and my teachers. However, these oldgenerations are so quick to nag me. One false move and I have to"run for cover" or else I will lose my head. Well, not literally anyway,but just the same, I still lose my head. Am I not entitled to commitmistakes? I am young and human. What can I do? Life is a little bitcomplicated. Don't you think so?When people around look at me, I feel like I am mini-humanbeing. They want me to act like a mature person but they won'tallow me to make decisions. They tell me to speak up but I can'tblurt out my feelings. I've got my rights also, but when can I use it?I'm just having a loud thinking.Everyone is expected to have a plan. Ask me, I've got minetoo. You know sometimes, I think I should only dream, not plananymore. Do you know why? It is because others keep butting in.Before I know it, their dreams and plans are the ones I am workingand doing. It is not that I should be working my dreams and plans?1. What is the main idea of the selection?2.

Yes,she was right because we learned these from our elders .We learn by examples and by watching or observing them at home.Yes,the family plays a greater role in shaping a child into a responsible and productive adult. The family is a child's first role model. They do not only set examples but they give every child  an opportunity to make important choices and decisions. Parents are the child's first teachers and whatever the child learns at home will forever be carried on and handed down to the generation to come.What did you learn from the selection?​</a>

                                            Convincing people to buy a product that you are selling is a difficult task especially if they do not appreciate the importance of the product. Vendors face this everyday. They are expected to make their potential customers realize that they urgently need the product being sold. Just like a vendor, you are also convincing people in normal conversations. When talking to friends, you share stories that are interesting and can entertain them. When helping a friend study for an exam, you make sure that you are convincing enough so your friend can trust you and believe that what you are saying is true. Figure 2.1. Convincing a customer to buy a product that you are selling In the school or office, professionals like teachers, scientists, and marketers need to plan good oral presentations to make sure their audience. (students, co-workers, buyers) will believe them. To make sure that you are also as convincing as they are, there are seven stages that you need to remember: LESSON 2 WHY DO I NEED TO BELIEVE IN SCIENCE? 17 • Preparation In preparing for your presentation, you need to know your audience and objectives. Ask yourself: • Who is going to see my presentation? (audience) . What should the audience need to learn in my presentation? (objectives) . Based on my audience and objectives, how should my presentation look like? (design) . Choosing Your Main Points In choosing the main points for your presentation, you need to know your topics and their relationships. Ask yourself: • What are the important topics in the presentation? (at least three) . How are the topics related to the objectives of the presentation? • How are the topics related to each other? . How should the topics be arranged? • Choosing Your Supporting Information In choosing the supporting information for your presentation, you need to know how you can make the audience believe and agree with the main topics. Ask yourself. . • What examples can I use to help the audience understand the topics? • What information can I show to help the audience believe the topics? • What can catch the attention and interest of my audience? 18 WHY DO I NEED TO BELIEVE IN SCIENCE?Need ko po tulong nya mga friend please po,ngaun na po para paipasa kona ​</a>

                            5. What's More
I always remember what my teacher in Values Education
said in her class one afternoon. She said that when we are born,
we do not have yet the set of values expected from us because
we learn them from our parents or adults who raise us. Yes, she
was right because we learn these from our elders. We learn by
examples and by watching or observing them at home.
Yes, the family plays a greater role in shaping a child into a
responsible and productive adult. The family is a child's first role
model. They do not only set examples but they give every child an
opportunity to make important choices and decisions. Parents are
the child's first teachers and whatever the child learns at home
will forever be carried on and handed down to the generations to
come.
What did you learn from the selection?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I learned that values are taught at home. It starts in the family. Parents will plant the values in their children, then school will cultivate the seed. Then both parents and teachers help the students' value grow</p><br />

No question about it. I have great respectwith my great elders and my teachers. However, these oldgenerations are so quick to nag me. One false move and I have to"run for cover" or else I will lose my head. Well, not literally anyway,but just the same, I still lose my head. Am I not entitled to commitmistakes? I am young and human. What can I do? Life is a little bitcomplicated. Don't you think so?When people around look at me, I feel like I am mini-humanbeing. They want me to act like a mature person but they won'tallow me to make decisions. They tell me to speak up but I can'tblurt out my feelings.

                            26. Convincing people to buy a product that you are selling is a difficult task especially if they do not appreciate the importance of the product. Vendors face this everyday. They are expected to make their potential customers realize that they urgently need the product being sold. Just like a vendor, you are also convincing people in normal conversations. When talking to friends, you share stories that are interesting and can entertain them. When helping a friend study for an exam, you make sure that you are convincing enough so your friend can trust you and believe that what you are saying is true. Figure 2.1. Convincing a customer to buy a product that you are selling In the school or office, professionals like teachers, scientists, and marketers need to plan good oral presentations to make sure their audience. (students, co-workers, buyers) will believe them. To make sure that you are also as convincing as they are, there are seven stages that you need to remember: LESSON 2 WHY DO I NEED TO BELIEVE IN SCIENCE? 17 • Preparation In preparing for your presentation, you need to know your audience and objectives.
