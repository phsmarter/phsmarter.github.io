                                            What does respect have to do with you and with others?Find out more by reading the two excerpts. Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

Advocacy campaign is a planned project over a given period of time to achievespecific advocacy goals3.

Research makes use of a formal, academic, and persuasive language tocommunicate discussions and present corresponding findings for variables studied.5. An advocacy refers to activities that argue, plead, support, or favor a certaincause.6. Language does not matter in research as it disables the researcher to effectivelycommunicate valuable results to the target readers.7. Association is a persuasion technique that makes the audience believe the ideathat everyone is doing it or that everyone likes something.8.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Training of a page, an esquire, and a knight:</p><p>A page was a young boy who began his training in a noble household at around the age of seven. He learned how to read and write, basic math, and social skills. He also learned how to ride horses and care for them, as well as how to hunt and use weapons. He served the lord and lady of the household and learned etiquette and manners.</p><p>An esquire was the next rank up from a page and usually started their training around the age of 14. They learned more advanced combat skills, such as jousting, sword fighting, and archery, as well as strategy and tactics. They also learned about chivalry and how to serve their lord and lady with honor and loyalty.</p><p>A knight was the highest rank and usually achieved around the age of 21. They were expected to be expert warriors and also uphold the ideals of chivalry, such as bravery, loyalty, and honor. They were expected to protect the weak and innocent and fight for justice and righteousness.</p><p>The aspects of training that are relevant to our youth include learning basic skills, such as reading and writing, as well as social skills, such as etiquette and manners. Youth can also benefit from learning about teamwork, leadership, and loyalty, as well as developing physical skills and discipline through activities like sports or martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Chivalry as an ideal may not be as prevalent today as it was in medieval times, but its principles of honor, loyalty, and selflessness are still relevant and can be applied in modern contexts. Examples of chivalrous behavior could include standing up for someone who is being bullied, being honest and fair in one's dealings, and serving others in need.</p><p></p><p>A critique is a systematic analysis of a piece of literature, film, or other media that evaluates its worth and validity. It is not merely informational, but rather aims to persuade the reader of the writer's assessment. A critique typically includes the following elements:</p><p></p><p>Title, author, and date of publication or release</p><p>Outline of the main ideas and thesis of the work</p><p>The writer's own thesis statement and main idea about the work</p><p>Analysis of what the writer likes and dislikes about the work, with specific examples to support their assessment</p><p>Assessment of whether the author or creator achieved their intended goal, such as informing or entertaining the audience</p><p>Evaluation of the work's focus, clarity, persuasiveness, originality, and other relevant factors</p><p>In writing a critique, it is important to approach the work objectively and provide evidence to support one's assessment. A critique can be a useful tool for evaluating and improving one's own writing or other creative endeavors.</p><p></p><br />

                            6. What does respect have to do with you and with others?Find out more by reading the two excerpts. Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.

If you search online, most of the explanations focus on bringing down spikes that would overload medical facilities, leading to unnecessary deaths. However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

Campaign provides a framework in which processes of advocacy can be easilydeveloped and enclosed.2. Advocacy campaign is a planned project over a given period of time to achievespecific advocacy goals3. Although research, campaign and advocacy differ at some extent, it can beobserved that they use a common language.4. Research makes use of a formal, academic, and persuasive language tocommunicate discussions and present corresponding findings for variables studied.5. An advocacy refers to activities that argue, plead, support, or favor a certaincause.6. Language does not matter in research as it disables the researcher to effectivelycommunicate valuable results to the target readers.7. Association is a persuasion technique that makes the audience believe the ideathat everyone is doing it or that everyone likes something.8. The use of questions that sometimes state the obvious can convince the reader toagree on the points being presented.9.
