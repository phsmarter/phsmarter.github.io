                    <p>The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</p>

                                            Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

                            1. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />

It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />

                            4. Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;
