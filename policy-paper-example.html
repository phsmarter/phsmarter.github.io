In this case, the person in question could be an <strong>official</strong>, an institution, or even a certain group. The goal is to solve a problem that is being faced by them. Policy is a guideline and restrictions that are carried out in general. Limits that become the direction of an action that must be done. As well as a rule that must be followed by the perpetrators. </p><p></p><p><strong>CLAIM OF VALUE:</strong></p><p>Claim of value can be interpreted as a <strong>price</strong>, <strong>award</strong>, or <strong>estimate</strong>. This means that the price or award attached to an object. The object referred to in this case can be in the form of objects, goods, circumstances, actions, behaviors, or other events. In other words, a claim of value can be interpreted as a form of appreciation and a situation that is beneficial to humans as a determinant and reference in assessing and carrying out an action. By referring to a value, a person can determine how he should act and behave properly so that it does not deviate from the definition of prevailing social norms.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>explicit and Implicit Claim</strong> here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/15502062</p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />
