Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING DELIVERY MODALITIES Adopting to the challenges of the times in fulfilling its mandate, the DepEd would be using blended and distance learning programs during this period of COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the President's preference that children would not be sent to school until it is safe to do so. There are three kinds of DLDM, the Modular Distance Learning (MDL), the Blended Leaning (BL) , and Homeschooling. The MDL, which is for learners who do not have internet connectivity. The Printed or Digital Modules (PDM) are delivered to the homes of learners or picked up by their parents or guardians at designated places within coordinated schedules. Digital means modules (e-modules) are saved in USB/flash drives, CDs, OTGs. To be able to access the content of these materials, laptops, computers or tablets are needed. For the Online Distance Learning (ODL),this modality is applicable to learners as well as teachers with technology devices in which internet connectivity is required. The second DLDM is the Blended Leaning (BL) which is a combination of ODL, MDL, and R/TVI. The learners make use of computers, tablets, smart phones, CD/DVD, USB storage, TV, /Radio and Printed Modules in learning. Through this modality learners are not required to report to school, physical distancing is observed and the number of people going out from their homes is minimized. The third DLDM is Homeschooling, It is the alternative learning modality learners that provides learners with access to formal education while staying in a home-based environment with a parent, guardian or tutors as authorized learning facilitators instead of classroom teachers.

                                            Name Grade ENGLISH S Section Quarter: 1 Week: 2 LAS No. 2 MELC(s: 1 distinguish compound from complex sentences. 2 compose compound and complex sentences using dependent and independent clauses, 3. compose clear and coherent sentences using coordinate and subordinate conjunctions. There are two types of clauses in a sentence. Independent clause or simple sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. It has a subject and verb, and it stands by itself as a complete idea. The other kind of clause is dependent clause These are not complete sentences, but they do contain a noun and a verb. It cannot stand alone. It needs more information to complete the thought. If two independent clauses are combined, it forms compound sentences. When these clauses are joined. they need a coordinating conjunction between them. Coordinating conjunctions include the following words: for, and, nor, but, or. yet, so. There are seven and you can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS. When a dependent clause is joined to an independent clause, it forms a complex sentence. It needs subordinating conjunctions such as because, since, so that, if, unless, whether than, although even though, after, until whenever, where, wherever, or a relative pronoun such as that, who, or which. Answer: Though he was late Direction: Read each sentence below. Encircle the independent clause and box the dependent or subordinate clause. Example: Though he was late, he still made a contribution. he still made a contribution. 1. After the 14-day quarantine, he was issued a certificate of completion. 2. Unless she reports it, she will be the missing link in the contact tracing. 3. Even though they finished the quarantine, they will still have to follow the health restrictions. 4. We went to the health office since laboratory tests were required. 5. Whenever you are ready, you need to let me know. 6. Wherever you are, I will find you. 7. Before the enhanced community quarantine, my mother bought basic food and medical supplies. 8. If my sister fails, I will be the one to blame. 9. Because of the pandemic, children and senior citizens are restricted to go out of their homes. 10.

UNDERSTANDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING DELIVERY MODALITIES Adopting to the challenges of the times in fulfilling its mandate, the DepEd would be using blended and distance learning programs during this period of COVID-19 pandemic consistent with the President's preference that children would not be sent to school until it is safe to do so. There are three kinds of DLDM, the Modular Distance Learning (MDL), the Blended Leaning (BL) , and Homeschooling. The MDL, which is for learners who do not have internet connectivity. The Printed or Digital Modules (PDM) are delivered to the homes of learners or picked up by their parents or guardians at designated places within coordinated schedules. Digital means modules (e-modules) are saved in USB/flash drives, CDs, OTGs. To be able to access the content of these materials, laptops, computers or tablets are needed. For the Online Distance Learning (ODL),this modality is applicable to learners as well as teachers with technology devices in which internet connectivity is required. The second DLDM is the Blended Leaning (BL) which is a combination of ODL, MDL, and R/TVI. The learners make use of computers, tablets, smart phones, CD/DVD, USB storage, TV, /Radio and Printed Modules in learning. Through this modality learners are not required to report to school, physical distancing is observed and the number of people going out from their homes is minimized. The third DLDM is Homeschooling, It is the alternative learning modality learners that provides learners with access to formal education while staying in a home-based environment with a parent, guardian or tutors as authorized learning facilitators instead of classroom teachers.

Name Grade ENGLISH S Section Quarter: 1 Week: 2 LAS No. 2 MELC(s: 1 distinguish compound from complex sentences. 2 compose compound and complex sentences using dependent and independent clauses, 3. compose clear and coherent sentences using coordinate and subordinate conjunctions. There are two types of clauses in a sentence. Independent clause or simple sentence can stand alone as a complete sentence. It has a subject and verb, and it stands by itself as a complete idea. The other kind of clause is dependent clause These are not complete sentences, but they do contain a noun and a verb. It cannot stand alone. It needs more information to complete the thought. If two independent clauses are combined, it forms compound sentences. When these clauses are joined. they need a coordinating conjunction between them. Coordinating conjunctions include the following words: for, and, nor, but, or. yet, so. There are seven and you can remember them using the acronym FANBOYS. When a dependent clause is joined to an independent clause, it forms a complex sentence. It needs subordinating conjunctions such as because, since, so that, if, unless, whether than, although even though, after, until whenever, where, wherever, or a relative pronoun such as that, who, or which. Answer: Though he was late Direction: Read each sentence below. Encircle the independent clause and box the dependent or subordinate clause. Example: Though he was late, he still made a contribution. he still made a contribution. 1. After the 14-day quarantine, he was issued a certificate of completion. 2. Unless she reports it, she will be the missing link in the contact tracing. 3. Even though they finished the quarantine, they will still have to follow the health restrictions. 4.
