In order for him to be promoted, he has to present a Case study on an area relevant to the identified purposes of the agency. In the presentation of his study, a deadline has been set. Since, he was preoccupied with a lot of work and other personal concerns, he was not able to work on his paper. In this situation, he bought a ready – made research paper. On his presentation, he could not properly answer the questions asked by the panel members because he did not make his own paper. In the critiquing, he does not agree with the suggestions such as improving some parts of his paper, proper citations, etc. In what ways did Mr. Camposano’s behavior violate the ethical principles? You may cite and discuss more than one principle (principles are provided in a separate document. Then, tell the possible effects of his/her action.  ​</a>

On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency.The chart below shows the cumulative number of cases starting from the day that symptoms were documented for the first case. When compared to the new virus, the spread of SARS took much longer to gain momentum. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012, took eight years to infect almost 2,500 people.Confirmed infections since the first case.Image: ReutersThe latest statistics indicate a fatality rate of about 2.2%, but disease experts say the actual rate may be higher or lower as there are likely more unconfirmed cases.The SARS virus killed about 10% of all infected individuals, while the MERS outbreak identified in 2012 had a fatality rate of around 35%.Fatality rateImage: ReutersDisease experts caution that it will take several more weeks to be confident of how the new virus behaves given how quickly it has spread and the fact that a reliable diagnostic test has only recently been introduced.“Not everybody is being seen, not everybody is being tested,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.“All the experts, myself included, tell the public that there is much we don’t know about this virus and we are learning as we go along. That is not so reassuring.”Some experts question whether the new virus shares similarities with seasonal flu, which has a low mortality rate but infects so many people that more than half a million may die from it each year, according to global health estimates.​</a>

                            15. Case study The photocopying businessis thriving in Dagupan City. Miss josefina "Fina" Datu is the owner and operatorof the biggest copying firm in the city. Fina has been in the business for more than 20 years and because of her courage and enterprise, she was able to put up 3 branches in each of the capital towns of 3 adjoining provinces, namely Nueva ecija, Tarlac and Pangasinan . She is planning to operate in nueva vizcaya and isabela in the near future. The business involves using machine to copy documents, books, magazine and other material. Fina employs 6 young ladies per branch. A big dealer in manila supplies her with the latest copying machine, paper and ink. Fina has open credit line with the dealer. Fina personally trains new employees in the firm's main office in Dagupan. After a month of training, the new employees are deployed in various branches. New employees are paid daily wages depending on output . They are also entitled to free board and lodging . The firm's customer consist of teachers,students, government employees and some others. Just a week ago, the dean of a big school in the city propose to her the copying of books to be sold to students. The dean indicate tht she will take care of selling the books to students in her School. For the service, the dean was expecting a 20 percent commission. Fina thinks the proposal is a good one and it will yield good profits. Shes not yet fully convince, however, is the proposal is ethically right . Fina considera seeking the advice of someone who should be informing her about the right thing to do before she makes a decision.Guide Question:If you were consulted by Fina, what would you advice her ?  why?NOTE : ESSAY TYPE ANSWER​</h2><br />
                        <p>If Fina consulted me about the ethical implications of the dean's proposal to copy books for students, my advice would be to carefully consider the potential consequences of this decision.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Fina needs to review any legal implications of copying and selling books, especially if there are any copyright or intellectual property rights involved. She needs to make sure that she is not violating any laws and regulations by taking on this project.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Fina needs to consider the impact of this decision on her reputation and that of her business. Copying and selling books to students may be viewed as unethical by some people, especially if it is perceived as taking advantage of students who are already struggling financially. This may lead to negative publicity, loss of customers, and ultimately, damage to her business.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, Fina should assess the financial implications of this proposal. While the proposal may generate significant profits, it may also require additional investment in equipment, labor, and other resources. She needs to ensure that the profits outweigh the costs and that the investment is worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Fina should evaluate the long-term consequences of this decision. Is this proposal in line with her business goals and values? Will it create sustainable growth and opportunities for her business? Will it align with the interests and needs of her customers?</p><br />

On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency.The chart below shows the cumulative number of cases starting from the day that symptoms were documented for the first case. When compared to the new virus, the spread of SARS took much longer to gain momentum. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012, took eight years to infect almost 2,500 people.Confirmed infections since the first case.Image: ReutersThe latest statistics indicate a fatality rate of about 2.2%, but disease experts say the actual rate may be higher or lower as there are likely more unconfirmed cases.The SARS virus killed about 10% of all infected individuals, while the MERS outbreak identified in 2012 had a fatality rate of around 35%.Fatality rateImage: ReutersDisease experts caution that it will take several more weeks to be confident of how the new virus behaves given how quickly it has spread and the fact that a reliable diagnostic test has only recently been introduced.“Not everybody is being seen, not everybody is being tested,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.“All the experts, myself included, tell the public that there is much we don’t know about this virus and we are learning as we go along. That is not so reassuring.”Some experts question whether the new virus shares similarities with seasonal flu, which has a low mortality rate but infects so many people that more than half a million may die from it each year, according to global health estimates.​</h2><br />

Ramon , a 20-year-old man, visits an outpatient clinic. He appears to be weak and lethargic. Ramon tells the health care provider that he feels like he has a bad case of the flu. He states he has night sweats that drench the bed, and that he has lost around 10 pounds since becoming ill. He seems anxious and admits that he has had unprotected sex with two male partners over the last few months. The care provider examines Ramon and documents that he has a fever and swollen lymph nodes in his neck.
Questions
1. Based on this information, what disorder might Ramon have?
2. How is this disorder transmitted from one person to another?
3. Why must the care provider continually monitor the T-cell count?
4. What complications can individuals with this disorder eventually develop?
