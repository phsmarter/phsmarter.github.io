I had to adjust to a new school, new teachers, and a new group of classmates. At the beginning, I found it difficult to make friends and feel comfortable in my new environment. However, with time and effort, I gradually got to know my classmates better and found people with similar interests. </p><p></p><p>Academically, Grade 7 was also a step up from the previous year. The workload was heavier, and the expectations were higher. I had to learn new subjects such as algebra and geometry, which required more critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I also had to manage my time better and be more organized to keep up with the demands of school.</p><p></p><p>Despite the challenges, I also had many memorable experiences in Grade 7. I participated in school sports teams, joined the school choir, and volunteered for various events. These activities helped me to develop new skills, make new friends, and gain confidence.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my Grade 7 journey was a significant milestone in my academic and personal growth. It taught me the importance of resilience, adaptability, and hard work. I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that I had and look forward to the next chapter of my academic journey.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Werner syndrome is characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of features associated with normal aging. Individuals with this disorder typically grow and develop normally until they reach puberty. Affected teenagers usually do not have a growth spurt, resulting in short stature. The characteristic aged appearance of individuals with Werner syndrome typically begins to develop when they are in their twenties and includes graying and loss of hair; a hoarse voice; and thin, hardened skin. They may also have a facial appearance described as "bird-like." Many people with Werner syndrome have thin arms and legs and a thick trunk due to abnormal fat deposition.</p>Highlighting The Cause<p>•Mutations in the WRN gene cause Werner syndrome. The WRN gene provides instructions for producing the Werner protein, which is thought to perform several tasks related to the maintenance and repair of DNA. This protein also assists in the process of copying (replicating) DNA in preparation for cell division .</p>Type<p>•Werner syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern , which means both copies of the WRN gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with Werner syndrome each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.</p>Effects Of This Mutation<p>•As Werner syndrome progresses, affected individuals may develop disorders of aging early in life, such as cloudy lenses (cataracts ) in both eyes, skin ulcers, type 2 diabetes, diminished fertility, severe hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis ), thinning of the bones (osteoporosis ), and some types of cancer.</p>Reflection<p>•Werner syndrome is characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of features associated with normal aging. Individuals with this disorder typically grow and develop normally until they reach puberty. Affected teenagers usually do not have a growth spurt, resulting in short stature.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#CARRY ON LEARNING#BRAINLYEVERYDAY<br />

These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells. In the most common and severe form of Tay-Sachs disease, signs and symptoms start to show up at about 3 to 6 months of age. As the disease progresses, development slows and muscles begin to weaken. Over time, this leads to seizures, vision and hearing loss, paralysis, and other major issues. Children with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically live only a few years.</p><p>At present, there is no known cure for the disease, Only ways and means, to help people accept and live comfortable lives with the disease: preventing breathing problems, relieving a term known as dysphagia (which is feeding or swallowing difficulties and therapy for patients who suffered loss of motor skills or paralysis.)</p><br />

According to their laws even if you are the third generation of your family to be born in the Dominican Republic you are still not granted citizenship, unless your family has been there prior to 1929. This has caused a lot of turmoil between Haiti and the Dominican Republic comma mainly because after the earthquake there are many who emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti. According to the Dominican republic government they are welcoming nations with open arms and simply require them to file for citizenship. However it is not as simple as the government makes it out to be. In the Dominican Republic many things go off of your birth certificate and if you cannot afford to get a new one then you may not apply for citizenship.</p><p></p><p>The most peaceful time is after your weekend projects at 11:42 PM, where for once you don't have any work to do.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A genetic disorder is a disease caused in whole or in part by a change in the DNA sequence away from the normal sequence. Genetic disorders can be caused by a mutation in one gene (monogenic disorder), by mutations in multiple genes (multifactorial inheritance disorder), by a combination of gene mutations and environmental factors, or by damage to chromosomes (changes in the number or structure of entire chromosomes, the structures that carry genes).</p><p></p><p>As we unlock the secrets of the human genome (the complete set of human genes), we are learning that nearly all diseases have a genetic component. Some diseases are caused by mutations that are inherited from the parents and are present in an individual at birth, like sickle cell disease. Other diseases are caused by acquired mutations in a gene or group of genes that occur during a person's life. Such mutations are not inherited from a parent, but occur either randomly or due to some environmental exposure (such as cigarette smoke). These include many cancers, as well as some forms of neurofibromatosis.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Epic poetry</strong></p><p> </p><p>The Epic poetry is considered the highest point of Filipino folk literature, and dates back to the  pre-colonial period. These epics, usually of romance or adventure, are commonly presented during festivals and gatherings such as weddings, baptisms, and wakes. Singers have been known to perform for hours at a time. One of the most famous epic poems is Biag ni Lam-ang, the national epic of the Ilocano people, and notable for being the first folk epic to be recorded in written form after being passed on from generation to generation.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Duplo</strong></p><p></p><p>The duplo is a poetic debate presented through song and dance, which originated from indigenous courtship customs. Poets used proverbs and riddles to present their suit to the woman of their choice. This ultimately evolved into a more formal debate on issues, and started to be called the balagtasan.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Moro-moro</strong> </p><p></p><p>For a time, one of the most popular types of theater in the Philippines was the Moros y Cristianos, which is not surprising for a country that was under Spanish rule for 300 years. Commonly called moro-moro, it is a street drama that usually lasted for several days, and presented both secular themes like love and vengeance, and the Spanish-influenced religious theme of the conflict between Christians and Moors. The moro-moro only survives in isolated towns today, and though an integral part of Filipino art history, it may not bear too much close scrutiny these days with its less than admirable depictions of intolerance.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Senakulo</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Another performing art stemming from religious custom is the senakulo or Passion Play. This is the dramatization of the life and death of Jesus Christ and is usually presented as a community activity during the Lenten season. This still endures to the present, ranging from simple productions to more technically sophisticated and modernized versions.</p><p></p><p>5. <strong>Traditional Folk Dance</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>With its varied cultures and communities throughout its 7000 islands, the Philippines has a diverse collection of folk dances. Some of the most popular folk dances are the Singkil, a folk dance that originated from the Maranao people of Lake Lanao in Mindanao, from the epic legend Darangen; the Itik-Itik, which originated as an improvised dance in Surigao del Sur and was discovered by National Artist for Dance Francisca Reyes-Aquino; and the Tinikling, which is similar to Singkil with its use of bamboo poles that dancers must weave through. It is supposed to mimic the movement of the local tikling birds.</p><p></p><p>6. <strong>Bodabil</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>It sounds like “vaudeville”, and it is. This form of theater was an American import in the pre-war era, but became uniquely Filipino with the indigenization of the name. Like its American counterpart, bodabil featured a variety of musical numbers, comedic and dramatic skits, and song and dance numbers. Popular Filipino performers such as Dolphy, Anita Linda, and sarsuwela legend Atang de la Rama got their start in bodabil. It has since died out with the rise of cinema, but its influence can still be felt in television variety shows.</p><p></p><p>7. <strong>Sarsuwela</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>The sarsuwela is a type of melodrama, usually in three acts, that uses alternately spoken and sung words. It was the Spanish influence that started the sarsuwela, but it was also this colonization that led Filipinos to incorporate nationalistic overtones in the art. This resulted in the arrest of several prominent writers such as Aurelio Tolentino and Pascual Poblete, and eventually, the shutdown of sarsuwela companies during the American occupation. As proof of its importance in Philippine culture, in 2011 the National Commission for Culture and the Arts designated the sarsuwela as a nominee for the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage lists.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>I </strong><strong>HOPE </strong><strong>ITS </strong><strong>HELP </strong><strong>PLS </strong><strong>LEAVE </strong><strong>A </strong><strong>HEART</strong></p><p></p><br />
