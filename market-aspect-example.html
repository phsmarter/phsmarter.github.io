                                            What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight
4. Feed Conversion Rate
• A satisfactory conversion ratio should be 1 kg live weight gain for 3 to
5 kg of feed consumed by an animal.
5. Costs and Returns of Production
• All expenses and sales recorded for one year to compute the returns
on your investment (ROI) at the end of the year.</a>

                            8. What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight
4. Feed Conversion Rate
• A satisfactory conversion ratio should be 1 kg live weight gain for 3 to
5 kg of feed consumed by an animal.
5. Costs and Returns of Production
• All expenses and sales recorded for one year to compute the returns
on your investment (ROI) at the end of the year.</h2><br />
