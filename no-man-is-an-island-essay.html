                        <p>"No man is an island." A sentence we always hear, a sentence already too cliche. We tend to hear this in situations when someone feels alone or when someone wants to be alone or freed. We also hear this at times when we want to express to someone that we need other people. </p><p></p><p>This saying simply means that no one can live alone. Living alone means having no life because you don't have interactions. We are all different. This is because we have purpose for each other. We need to share everybody's skills to live in an exceptional world. We need to share everybody's strength to overcome everybody's weaknesses. We need the world. </p><p></p><p>Whenever you feel alone, always remember, no man is an island. There will always be someone there for you. If you want to be totally independent, you won't be for long because soon, you'll realize how important other people are.</p><p></p><p>#AnswerForTrees</p><p>#BrainlyBookSmart</p><br />

Who do you think would benefit from these speeches in particular? Be able to explain your answer.1.All of those nights we spent cramming for the test the next morning, all of the books we read and the essays we wrote, all of the lessons we learned from not only our teachers, but our friends as well, all of the friendships/relationships we began, ended and mended, and all of the wonderful and terrrible experiences we have had throughout high school and the other years we spent in K-12 education have led up to this day that we never thought would come so fast.2.No man is an island. Everyone needs someone to depend on. Nobody can live without the help of each other. Be good and be friendly.3.Life is beautiful. Sulking will not do you good. It would just make you sad. Go out and explore the beauty of surroundings. Again, life is beautiful to waste it crying over unimportant things.4.Supressing your anger is not good for any person. It will only make one worse. if you are angry, there are ways to release it in heathy ways. One, write down what you feel at the moment. Spend some time writing about it. This could help ease that heavy feeling in your chest. Second, do physical activities. This can be activities like exercise or any sport. Third, talk to someone about your feeling. Talking will be a big help in easing out your anger.​​</h2><br />
