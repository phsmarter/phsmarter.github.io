                                            My mother grew old and became thin but Anita never stopped asking favors from mother that made me mad about her. One day, she asked mother to knit a shawl. Mother could not say no even though the task was so difficult for her. My heart grew sad every time I saw her doing the laborious task but she never complained. I never wanted to see Mother lift a finger. She was too old to work. And we wanted to save the burden even doing the lightest household chores. Question Answer 3. How do you describe Mother? 4. Is it reasonable to let your mother work even when she's already old? Why, why not? 5. If you are the sister, what would you have told Anita?​</a>

4. What do you think is the reason why La Villa Tierra entitled his work as
such?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The <strong>poem</strong> describes how great a mother’s love is.  The mother’s heart is measured in the poem by how she loves and cares for his son despite the things that he did.  If I were to relate this poem to my mother, she is someone who would also be willing to give her all to her children.
I guess the author, Jose La Villa Tierra, entitled his work “<strong>Ballad of a Mother’s Heart</strong>” because the poem narrates a story depicting how great a mother’s love is.

What significant characteristics of a mother are</p><p>described in the poem?</p><p></p><p>The poem described the significant characteristics of a mother as one <strong>shows unconditional love</strong>. It also portrays the <strong>never-ending patience</strong> they have and the <strong>wisdom</strong> they carry. </p><p></p><p>2. Why is the mother compared to a cradle?</p><p></p><p>The mother is compared to a cradle because <strong>she holds and rocks us</strong>. When life seems hard and we just want to shut ourselves out from the world, our mothers will <strong>always be there to care for us</strong>. From when we are young to when we are old enough to fend for ourselves, our mothers will <strong>always provide for our needs.</strong></p><p></p><p>3. How will you relate the context of the poem to your</p><p>own mother?</p><p></p><p>Just like with me and my own mother, the mother and speaker of the poem have a <strong>symbiotic relationship</strong> that cannot be broken. No amount of time and distance can ever erase my connection with my mother. I will be always connected to her. I will always remember her in all the beautiful and ugly parts and I will always accept her as she is, just like how she accepts me as I am. </p><p></p><p>4. What do you think is the reason why the author wrote</p><p>the poem?</p><p></p><p>The author wrote the poem because she wants to show her <strong>appreciation </strong>for her mother. This is a <strong>recollection </strong>of all her memories with her mother while growing up, during good times and bad times.
