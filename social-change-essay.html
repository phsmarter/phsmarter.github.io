Below, we will discuss how these act as agents of social change, and we’ll examine real-world examples. We will focus on four agents of change that social scientists recognize: technology, social institutions, population, and the environment.</p><p></p><p>Some would say that improving technology has made our lives easier. Imagine what your day would be like without the Internet, the automobile, or electricity. In The World Is Flat, Thomas Friedman (2005) argues that technology is a driving force behind globalization, while the other forces of social change (social institutions, population, environment) play comparatively minor roles. He suggests that we can view globalization as occurring in three distinct periods. First, globalization was driven by military expansion, powered by horsepower and wind power. The countries best able to take advantage of these power sources expanded the most, and exert control over the politics of the globe from the late fifteenth century to around the year 1800. The second shorter period from approximately 1800 C.E. to 2000 C.E. consisted of a globalizing economy. Steam and rail power were the guiding forces of social change and globalization in this period. Finally, Friedman brings us to the post-millennial era. In this period of globalization, change is driven by technology, particularly the Internet (Friedman 2005).</p><p></p><p>But also consider that technology can create change in the other three forces social scientists link to social change. Advances in medical technology allow otherwise infertile women to bear children, which indirectly leads to an increase in population. Advances in agricultural technology have allowed us to genetically alter and patent food products, which changes our environment in innumerable ways. From the way we educate children in the classroom to the way we grow the food we eat, technology has impacted all aspects of modern life.</p><br />

                            3. essay about social cultural and political change?​ in english</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Ecology and conservation are guided and constrained by the social, cultural, and political attitudes and agendas of a particular place and time. As conservation is concerned with the effects of human actions on ecological systems and with marshaling efforts to reduce those effects, it lies more directly at the crossroads between science and society than does ecology, although both are ultimately manifestations of culture and society. Laws, regulations, or cultural prohibitions are developed by societies to resolve conflicts among values, or at least to establish which values dominate and will govern individual or collective actions. Changes in societal and political attitudes can affect how conservation is implemented and what is conserved. The sociopolitical context of conservation and ecology is an ever‐changing tableau of attitudes, perspectives, interests, laws, and agendas that is grounded on a changing base of population demographics.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Over time, the roles of heroes have shown a significant difference that is apparent in many ways. Considering the different periods and heroes in these periods, there are changes that are seen in the social, political, and cultural scenes. In the study of the differences that different timelines present, the lives of heroes provide a good example. While these periods shed a light on the unique histories linked to them, they also present a great link to study the social, political, and the cultural scenes. Therefore, this paper focuses on the lives of Beowulf, Aeneas, and Achilles to present the differences that can be used to ascertain these changes in the timelines.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the hero role in different times relate to the social, political, and cultural changes that have been constantly changing. The political scenes in the three different timelines presented by Beowulf, Aeneas, and Achilles present a similarities and differences in the roles that they all had. Beowulf¸ the strong leader saw it his duty to save his people from monsters. Despite the help that he seeks from his friends to cross the sea, he presents the heroism that his people were needed. On the other hand, Aeneas also leaves his town with the intent of providing his people with the safety that they would require from their leader. As a leader, he becomes the first to present a solution, and at the same time, becomes the first to take action in a bid to resolve the situation. Contrary, Achilles who was the Greek hero presents a different aspect of leadership. In the case of Beowulf and Aeneas, the heroic acts are of the benefit of people looking up to them, while in the case of Achilles, he is out to avenge his friend. Therefore, he is an independent hero and at the same time, a leader in his time.</p><p></p><p>Heroism in the different timelines is defined in different aspects. While Beowulf and Aeneas consider heroism as an act for the favor of the people, Achilles heroism is a self-act of an extraordinary approach. The social perspectives in the three different timelines portend that during the time of Achilles, the communal links were slowly disintegrating. While in the time of Beowulf and Aeneas, the leaders considered their acts a solution for the benefit of the society. Culture, however, is a consistently changing aspect in the different timelines. The three different heroes present a consistent change in cultural practices portending to developments. According to Lawall (25), Beowulf represents a medieval culture that develops slowly with the systems of leadership still in the early stages. Aeneas and Achilles, on the other hand, present an idealistic change in systems. In their fight for ideals that they believe, it is apparent that the times present a change in the cultural ties of the communities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the different timelines present similarities and differences that relate to the lifestyles of the different heroes. While their actions present a similarity, political, social, and cultural, on the other hand, have been changing with the different timelines. However, the changes are less likely linked to the lives of these hero’s and still relates to their social, political, and cultural scenes. Therefore, these changes in the timelines reflect on the changes in the hero’s life, which denote the changing hero figure and perspectives in the contemporary life.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Social Changes and Transformation"
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Considering the world being a global village, Information and communication technologies(ICT) have become more valuable entity in all aspects of life. Over thirty years, the use ofICT has fundamentally changed the practices and procedures of nearly all forms of exertionsurrounded by business, governance and education. In recent years, many organizations andgovernments have worked to increase frankness and clearness in their actions on howInformation and communication technologies (ICTs) are understood by many people as acost-effective and suitable means to promote candidness and social changes in E-government, E-learning and social interaction in particular. Some of these individual effortshave received considerable attention on the issue of whether these ICT-enabled efforts havethe ability to create a substantive social change in approaches toward transparency or not.In this article, I reviewed multidisciplinary literature concerning the role of ICT onsocial changes and transformation and identify some viewpoints regarding the nature of therole ICT played in social changes and transformation toward innovation. I then discuss fourformed by combining the perspectives on nature of the ICTs innovation on socialdevelopment and transformation in a tabular form. My review suggests that ICTs research, inspite of its incredible theoretical abilities to study technology innovation in relation tosocioeconomic context, remains weak in forming conclusive arguments about IT-enabledsocioeconomic development as a result of digital divides

                        <p><strong>Fake news can change the social and political life </strong>of a person. Receiving fake news can affect our decision in many ways. For example, you are about to meet a client in a neighbouring town, but you received a news that the town was bombed. So as a result, you cancelled the meeting. But you later found out that it was fake news. And it’s too late already because you already cancelled a very important meeting. Another example is receiving fake news about a big calamity. Then people tend to do a panic buying in grocery stores. These changes are one of the social changes because of fake news.  <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/919086</strong></p><p>The political life of a person especially the <strong>beliefs can also change because of fake news</strong>. Take this an example because many fake news will be released when the election is near. If you hear that an official is immoral, which is intentional fake news, there is a tendency that you will not vote him because nobody wants a bad person to lead a community. If you also hear negative things about the official’s immediate family, you probably won’t vote for him because everybody wants to vote an official who has good family background. Same as giving positive fake news, you will vote a candidate who has positive feedback, without even knowing that those were false news.  <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1877816</strong></p><p>Fake news is very rampant nowadays especially in social media. What is the <strong>best way to discover fake news</strong>? Investigate. If you don’t have the initiative to investigate, you will believe the fake news. So don’t be blinded with fake news, you can find the truth anymore in the reliable platform.  <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1751898</strong></p><br /><br />

                        ✏️ Answer<p></p><p><strong>AN IMPORTANT AGENT OF SOCIAL CHANGE</strong></p><p></p><p>Social change agents work to make an impact in the world on a local and global level. The impact they make depends on how many people they can influence to think and act in ways similar to them. To be effective at social change, an agent must be excellent at influencing others.</p><p></p><p>Some examples of what an social change agent can do to influence others are showing others that it is in their best interest,listening,having a clear vision,being aware,being fearless and having something someone wants.</p><p></p><p>We can all work to create social change and make a difference where we live, where we work, and in the lives of those around us.Social change agents work to make the world a better place. They use many tools to influence others to make a positive impact as well. From listening and being aware, to being fearless and having a clear vision, there are many ways social change agents influence others.</p><p></p><p>________________________________</p><p></p><p>1. Show It Is in Their Best Interest</p><p></p><p>Most people are hesitant about any type of change—except when the change benefits them. As Dr. Dean Gualco explains in a Walden Social Change Series webinar, “Anytime you change something, you have to think about how it’s going to benefit somebody else—and that is what you promote.” He gives the example of doubling someone’s pay. That is a change most people would welcome, even if they claim they don’t like change. As Dr. Gualco puts it, “Change is almost always accepted when people see that it is in their best interest to change.”¹ Social change agents do a great job of showing how change will benefit others.</p><p></p><p>2. Listen</p><p></p><p>During another Walden Social Change Series webinar, Dr. Henry Brashen asked the audience the most important thing someone could do to influence another person. While there were many answers, the one Dr. Brashen highlighted was listening. He noted that when you want to influence someone, the most important thing you should do is take a step back and listen. He explained that others gravitate toward people who listen. This allows the listener to engage in what is important to the talker.² Effective social change agents draw people to them simply by listening.</p><p></p><p>3. Have a Clear Vision</p><p></p><p>To influence others, a social change agent must have a clear vision and message. People who waver or are inconsistent in their message drive others away rather than influence them.³ Having a clear vision and communicating it consistently is a great way social change agents influence others.</p><p></p><p>4. Be Aware</p><p></p><p>Social change agents are highly aware of what is happening around them and use that as a tool to influence others.⁴ Change agents tend to notice things other don’t, which helps them determine what needs to be changed and how the change will occur.</p><p></p><p>5. Be Fearless</p><p></p><p>Social change agents must be fearless. Change agents often face rejection and ridicule, but how they deal with setbacks separates them from others.⁵ An effective change agent is fearless and does not let rejection keep them down. Their passion can be contagious and can actually influence others. Social change agents are effective because they don’t give up and their determination is influential to others.</p><p></p><p>6. Have Something Someone Wants</p><p></p><p>For a social change agent to have influence, they must also have something someone wants. If they don’t, they won’t be influential. As Dr. Gualco put it in his presentation on social change, you have to figure out what people want. “If you have it, you have influence,” he says. Whom the change agent is trying to influence will determine what will be enough to have influence.¹ To influence a superior, you must have something more important than if you were influencing a subordinate. Social change agents are successful at influencing others because they know they have something someone else wants and use that to influence others.</p><p></p><p><strong>☁️</strong><strong> </strong><strong>CASSADEE</strong></p><br />

                        Essay about social sciences played an important role in our society as embraces changes
<p>
</p>In recent years STEM  (science, technology, engineering, and math) sciences have attracted the bulk of funding and support from government, universities, and others in recent years, the value of social sciences should not be overlooked. Indeed, social science is increasingly important and necessary in fields such as social and primary care, the justice system, and industry, to name a few. As a result, it is critical that this educational disparity be resolved and that more funding be given to the social sciences.
<p></p>Social change is the process by which human experiences and relationships alter cultural and social processes over time, with far-reaching consequences for society. As a part of these social justice campaigns, relationships have shifted, institutions have changed, and societal expectations have changed. It is the product of a number of variables that endorse the transition, rendering it unavoidable. - Since more knowledge is available in the society, social transformation contributes to greater sensitivity and empathy, allowing individuals to make better choices based on the situation at hand. Social scientists have identified four common causes: technology, social systems, economy, and the environment. All four of these factors will have an effect on when and how culture evolves. And they are all  interconnected: a change in one field will cause changes in others.
While the words "social sciences" can conjure up visions of social workers or instructors for many people, this is a gross misinterpretation of the diversity of positions available within this field, as well as the effect it has on the broader community. In general, social sciences are concerned with the study of culture and the interactions that occur between people within society. Economic, political, and sociological research, as well as history, archaeology, anthropology, and law, are all examples of social scienceIn contrast to STEM sciences, social science will offer insight into how science and engineering operate – it is, in essence, the science of science. Social scientists, in particular, have the analytical and communication skills that are needed in a wide variety of sectors and organizations.<p></p><p>

                            24. How is social media changing parent and child relationship essay?</h2><br />
                        <p>Social media is a great tool for communication. This is the common reason why children and parents stay connected to each other especially when parents work more than the usual hours and get home late. Social media can both be an advantage and a disadvantage to a parent-child relationship.</p><p></p><p>Social media is advantageous for parents who work overseas or for those who always work overtime. Through social media, they can monitor their child's daily progress in some aspects while working. They may ask their child from time to time if they have already eaten their meals or if they are already at home. Working while taking care of their children is typical for busy parents and social media greatly helps them.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, if parents usually stay at home and either the child or the parent is too focused on updating their social media accounts, then this is a disadvantage. Most of the time, children or young ones enjoy social media so much that they are unconscious about time. They don't realize that social media eats up too much of their time. Instead of boding or talking with their parents, they are busy updating their status.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, this scenario can also happen to parents. Some parents get excited in using social media. They can get connected to their long lost friends or relatives. They are eager to update their status in an online group that they have joined recently. They are happy to get in touch with new friends they have acquired online that they tend to forget their duties as parents and somehow, this affects not only them but their children as well.</p><p></p><p>Social media is inevitable in this generation. Everyone is hooked up whether you're a newbie or an oldie.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The relationship between human development and fertility has recently received 
</p><p>considerable attention, with some studies claiming that the established negative 
</p><p>correlation between fertility and measures of human development, such as HDI, has 
</p><p>fundamentally changed among the most advanced countries</p><p>research, however, has been the relatively short-term focus, with analyses focusing on 
</p><p>development and fertility trends beginning in the last decades of the 20th century. In this 
</p><p>paper we argue that a more long-term perspective to this question is in order. 
</p><p>Encompassing a broader time horizon beginning in the early 20th century, this paper 
</p><p>combines novel empirical evidence with a wide body of social science literature to 
</p><p>provide new theoretical insights into the interrelations among low fertility, 
</p><p>socioeconomic development, and gender equity. Specifically, we argue that the onset and 
</p><p>long-term pace of socioeconomic development are inherently linked with a key driver of 
</p><p>fertility variation within developed countries: differing gender equity regimes. Moreover, 
</p><p>we argue that these gender equity regimes are not static, but instead, dynamic and closely 
</p><p>tied to changes in fertility through a demographic feedback mechanism: a gender-equity 
</p><p>dividend.</p><br />
