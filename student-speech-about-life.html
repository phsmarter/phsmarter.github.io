                        <p>Is it possible to work 70 hours a week? Yes! Some students do! Sometimes, it is very hard for students to deal with part-time job, school, long-term works, friends and family obligations. It is not always feasible to work all night on an essay that you hadn't the time to work on. Unfortunately, some students take the easy way to settle the problem... they copy someone's work and make it as their own. School fees and books are very costly.Also, students do not always have the time to do their assignments. Sometimes, it is like that tutors co-ordinate assignments so that the due date is the same day. Even the most organized student can find himself sitting at the computer at 4am. Are these assignments really necessary? Sometimes we get deprive from our time to bond with our family... Yes we know that being a student, a good student who does his / her best secures a brighter future... But whatever we attain doesn't long lasts forever so might as well let us enjoy our life longer....</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is said that “student life is golden life,” because student life is the most important part of human life. It is the period of pure joy and happiness, because the mind of a student is free from cares and worries of a grown-up life.</p><p></p><p>In this period, the character of man is built. So, it is called the formative period of human life. Every student should try his best to make the best use of his student life.</p><p></p><p>The primary duty of a student is to learn and to acquire knowledge. He must do all his work at the right moment and maintain punctuality and discipline. He must remember that if a student becomes successful in his student career and his character is built on a sound basic, he will be able to shine in any sphere of life and serve his society and countries.</p><p></p><p>A student should spend most of his time of this golden period in reading and learning. A good student never waste his time fixed for reading uselessly. But he must not be a book-worm being always engaged in his studies. He should also be careful about his health and spend some time daily in some sports and games. He should try to develop his body and mind at the same time.</p><p></p><p>As a student he must try to develop his intellect. He should also try to acquire some good qualities like obedience, dutifulness, respect on elders and love and sympathy for fellow man in the society. The duty of a student is to obey his parents and teachers and respect the elders of the society.</p><p></p><p>Students are the future hope of country. So every student should try to be the best citizen in all respect, so that he may serve his country as far as he can.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Students, seven letters    pero maraming natutunan mula sa kanilang mga guro. Mahirap kapa mayaman na studyante  isa lang ang layunin, matuto at makapagtapos. Kahit malayo o malapit ang paaralan sisikaping matunton makapag-aral lang. Pero yung Ina baon lang papasok na sya. Pero pag tayo ay nakapagtapos tutuparin natin ang sting mga mithiin. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Like in many countries, in the fight against COVID-19, schools in North Macedonia have closed and learning is taking place online. The amount of content, online assessment, much of it without adequate instructions, are just some of the problems that young people face in this new learning environment. The Ministry of Education and Science in cooperation with UNICEF and other partners created a new online-learning platform called EDUINO, where pre-primary and primary school students can continue their education through video lessons, resources and a variety of games. In addition an educational program called TV Classroom is being broadcast on the national television. The primary and secondary schools have also started holding online classes through various digital platforms. All of these are good efforts, but - do all students have the means to attend online classes and what can we say about the actual quality of education in this online environment? </p><p></p><p></p><p>tipid mo naman 5 points lang </p><p></p><br />
