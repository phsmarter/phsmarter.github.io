They enjoyed their freedom and the wealth of our country. When the Spaniardscame, our forefathers learned better ways of living but their freedom became limited. Theylonged to be free once more. They hated to be under foreign rule. They fought and died forthe freedom we now enjoy. We still dream the dreams they had, that we are Filipinos andthat the Philippines belongs to the Filipinos.Although we are divided into different regions, and people in each region speakdifferent dialects, we are united by a common national language, the Filipino language.

                            21. II. Directions: Write a feature article by arranging the following sentences featuring Siargao Island as the "Surfing Capital of the Philippines". Use a sheet of pad paper in writing the article. (10 pts.) A. The Philippines, in its entirety, is a beautiful genuine country, blessed with rich natural resources and cool spots rarely seen in other countries. B. Recently, Siargao Island's Cloud 9 was dubbed as the Top 8 among the World's Best Surfing Spots by CNNGO, a travel site of CNN International. C. Being a tropical country, it is obviously common that tourists would want to go the beaches and wonderful scenery that would always involve the ball of heat (aka the sun). D. Cloud 9 created a venue for beginner and pro surfers to enjoy the thick waves that it had been blessed with. E. Siargao Island is known to be the "Surfing Capital of the Philippines" and it indeed maintained its reputation by landing on the top 10 list by CNNGO. F. The island is located in Surigao del Norte, where it embodies a structure of a beautiful tourist spot from the "beautiful white sand beaches, naturally-carved tide pools, mangrove forests, coves, caves, and schools of non-stingy jellyfish" it beholds. G. Of course, the never-ending hospitality coming in the form of the warm smiles and welcomes of the Filipinos in Siargao will leave foreigners wanting to come back again. H. Siargao has been known to increase in popularity among the people because of the attention that is given by the national government. l. It is indeed a paradise yet to be seen by the whole world. J. Tourism in the small island would boost to a whole new level eventually while preserving its natural beauty. Noyurl.com/bo295​</h2><br />
