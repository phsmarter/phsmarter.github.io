"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</a>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</h2><br />

                        <p>At the end of the song, the speaker asks the audience to “Sing with me” and repeatedly reminds them that there is only “one world.” The invitation to “Sing with me” emphasizes the overall meaning of the song, which is that we are better when we are together than when we are apart. The repeated reminder that we only have the “one world” implies that if we carry on down the same path of anger and division, then we will destroy our world once and for all.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>cttro</p>I think it's the ”Something’s wrong”.  Something is wrong in the place that we are living in. Something is wrong with the way how people see the world and how they treat each other. Something is wrong with the Filipino’s mentality and that something’s wrong is the hatred they're feeling towards each other. <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In truth, I think the meaning of the song, is that whoever was singing this, wanted to seek and find God. They state in a few verses that he/she was made by God, and yet, they have never seen him. They ask of God to teach him/her how to find him, to seek him. They state that they cannot see him, unless he teaches them, or that they cannot find him unless he shows himself to them. They want to love God when they find him, and they want him to teach their hearts on how to find him.</strong></p><p><strong>The line that I found interesting was:</strong></p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Teach my heart where to find You, for I cannot see You unless You teach me, or find You unless You show yourself to me."</strong></p><p><strong>I found it interesting because it shows that no matter how hard we try, only God can show himself. No amount of will and force can make God show himself to us. It is him we need to find, not the other way around. We are not the ones who will show ourselves to him, but rather, he would show himself to us.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
