High emotional intelligence can help a manager
improve workplace communication skills, employee
motivation and organizational effectiveness. If a manager
has high empathy, a key component of emotional
intelligence, he or she will be able to listen to the
concerns of employees and will be more understanding
of their needs, wants and concerns. This will most likely
translate into increased motivation and satisfaction of
employees and ultimately, will have a positive effect on
the effectiveness of the business. It is important to note,
however, that emotional intelligence is a concept that is
not universally understood to have the same meaning
and is not universally believed to be a key determiner of
business success. Highly authoritarian, top down
approaches are employed in many successful businesses
today.</a>

High emotional intelligence can help a manager
improve workplace communication skills, employee
motivation and organizational effectiveness. If a manager
has high empathy, a key component of emotional
intelligence, he or she will be able to listen to the
concerns of employees and will be more understanding
of their needs, wants and concerns. This will most likely
translate into increased motivation and satisfaction of
employees and ultimately, will have a positive effect on
the effectiveness of the business. It is important to note,
however, that emotional intelligence is a concept that is
not universally understood to have the same meaning
and is not universally believed to be a key determiner of

Is it possible to run a business without knowing its management function and its nature? Please explain youranswer.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Organizational structure is important because it orders your organization to deliver value to a market. Your organization's value chain is the sequence of high-level operations that represents your core value-creating process. It is the translation of competitive strategy into activity.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The formal appraisal is a great opportunity to give your employees sincere feedback, spurring them on to work smarter and better. Employees really value frequent praise and recognition, so letting them know you are aware of the good work that they're doing will help you to retain hard-working staff.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Yet few people understand that to be a good leader, you first need to be a great follower. As Aristotle said, "He who cannot be a good follower, cannot be a good leader." Being a good follower isn't about being one of hundreds of lemmings that execute instructions with blind loyalty. Today's followers are more evolved.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p><strong>HOPE IT HELPS :) :) :) :) :)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />
