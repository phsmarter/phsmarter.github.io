Recently, I have been reflecting on my own experiences with kinship and how they have been shaped by the various social cultures I have encountered throughout my life.</p><p></p><p>Growing up in a Filipino family, kinship was a fundamental aspect of my upbringing. I was taught to show respect to my elders and to always prioritize the needs of my family over my own. This included extended family members such as aunts, uncles, and cousins, who were often considered as close as immediate family members. I remember spending weekends and holidays with my relatives, attending family gatherings, and taking part in traditional celebrations such as Christmas and Easter.</p><p></p><p>However, as I grew older and started to interact with people from different cultures, I began to realize that kinship could take on very different forms. For example, in Western cultures, it is common for people to move away from their families as they become adults and to prioritize their own individual goals and desires over those of their family. This is a stark contrast to the collectivist culture that I grew up in, where the needs of the group always come first.</p><p></p><p>These different cultural values have had a profound impact on the way I view kinship and family. On one hand, I value the closeness and support that comes with a collectivist culture, as it has instilled in me a strong sense of community and connection with my relatives. On the other hand, I also appreciate the independence and self-reliance that comes with individualist cultures, as it has allowed me to pursue my own goals and aspirations.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, the way that kinship is conceptualized and practiced reflects broader social and cultural values. For example, a culture that values individualism may prioritize personal achievement and independence, whereas a culture that values collectivism may prioritize the needs of the group and the maintenance of social harmony.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, my reflections on kinship have shown me the importance of understanding and appreciating different social cultures. By recognizing the diverse ways in which people conceptualize and practice kinship, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Ultimately, this can help us to build stronger and more inclusive communities that are grounded in mutual respect and understanding.</p><p><strong>BRAINLIEST ME </strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Creating multimodal texts is an increasingly common practice in contemporary classrooms. Easy to produce multimodal texts include posters, storyboards, oral presentations, picture books, brochures, slide shows (PowerPoint), blogs, and podcasts. More complex digital multimodal text productions include web pages, digital stories, interactive stories, animation, and film.
</p><p>
</p><p>Student authors need to be able to effectively create multimodal texts for different purposes and audiences, with accuracy, fluency, and imagination. To do this, students need to know how meaning is conveyed through the various modes used in the text, as well as how multiple modes work together in different ways to convey the story or the information to be communicated.
</p><p>
</p><p>Students need to know how to creatively and purposefully choose how different modes might convey particular meaning at different times in their texts, and how to manipulate the various combinations of different modes across the whole text to best tell their story (Jewitt, 2009).

                        <p>Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that is protected by many laws and international agreements. In recent years, the rise of social media has led to a significant increase in the depth and width of this freedom. Social media platforms have given individuals the ability to express themselves in new and innovative ways, and to reach a global audience. However, with this freedom comes the responsibility to use it in a proper way.</p><p></p><p>The depth of freedom of expression on social media refers to the variety of ways in which individuals can express themselves. Social media platforms allow users to share text, images, videos, and audio, which gives them a vast array of options to express themselves. Users can also create and join groups and communities, which allows them to connect with others who share their interests and perspectives. This depth of freedom allows individuals to express themselves in a unique and personal way, and to connect with others who share their views.</p><p></p><p>The width of freedom of expression on social media refers to the global reach of social media platforms. Social media platforms connect people from all over the world, and allow individuals to express themselves to a global audience. This has led to the creation of global movements and campaigns, which would have been difficult to organize and mobilize without social media. The width of freedom of expression also allows for the spread of information and ideas, which can lead to greater understanding and acceptance of different cultures and perspectives.</p><p></p><p>However, with the increase in freedom of expression on social media, there is also a responsibility to use it in a proper way. The anonymity and accessibility of social media can lead to the spread of hate speech and misinformation. Social media platforms have a responsibility to ensure that their users are using the platform in a proper way, and that they are not spreading hate speech or misinformation. Additionally, individuals have a responsibility to use social media in a responsible and respectful manner, and to be aware of the potential impact of their words and actions on others.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it is important to consider how freedom of expression on social media can be limited in certain countries, where government censorship and surveillance are prevalent. These limitations can have a chilling effect on free speech, and can prevent individuals from expressing themselves freely and openly. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of these limitations and to advocate for the protection of freedom of expression in these contexts.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the depth and width of freedom of expression on social media is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows individuals to express themselves in new and innovative ways, and to reach a global audience. On the other hand, it also has the potential to spread hate speech and misinformation. It is important for individuals to use this freedom responsibly, and for social media platforms to take steps to ensure that the platform is being used in a proper way. Additionally, it is important to advocate for the protection of freedom of expression in contexts where it is limited.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Freedom of self-expression is a fundamental human right that allows individuals to express their thoughts, opinions, and beliefs freely. Social media platforms have greatly increased the depth and width of this freedom, providing a vast and accessible platform for people to share their voices.</p><p></p><p>However, with great freedom comes great responsibility. The ability to express oneself freely on social media also means that individuals must use this freedom responsibly. This includes not spreading hate speech, misinformation, or engaging in cyberbullying. It also means being mindful of the potential consequences of one's words, as social media posts can have a wide reach and impact.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the anonymity of social media can also lead to a lack of accountability for one's actions. This can lead to a toxic environment in which individuals feel emboldened to say things they would not say in person. Therefore, it is important to use social media in a way that is respectful and considerate of others.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, social media has greatly expanded the depth and width of freedom of self-expression. However, it is crucial that individuals use this freedom responsibly and with consideration for the impact their words may have on others. By using social media in a proper way, we can ensure that it remains a powerful tool for self-expression and communication.</p><br />

In development of natural sciences, his input cannot go unnoticed.</p><p> He believed that philosophy was a mega entity that encompassed all aspects of knowledge expressed through it.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>Hinduism :Law of <strong>Karma </strong><strong>(Essay)</strong><p></p><p></p><p>Have you ever heard someone say “what goes around comes around?”</p><p></p><p> Many religions believe in Karma. Karma means a deed or an act. The three major religions that believe in Karma are Sikhism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. These three religions share somewhat the same views and beliefs on Karma. These three religions believe that human beings spend their time in a cycle of birth, life, and rebirth. Every mainstream religion teaches us about the consequences of our actions. The explanations may differ, but does it really matter in the end whether the law of karma causes us trouble or God himself in his final judgment?</p><p></p><p>Karma, also known as Karman is a basic concept common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The doctrine of Karma states that one's state in this life is a result of actions both physical and mental in past carnations, and action in this life can determine one's destiny in future incarnations.</p><p></p><p> Karma is a natural, impersonal law of moral cause and effect and has no connection with the idea of a supreme power that decrees punishment of forgiveness of sins. Karmic law is universally applicable, and only those who have attained liberation from rebirth, called mukti (or moksha) or nirvana, can be transcend it.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Socialization affects us in so many ways far beyond what we see,  including self-image. Our socialization patterns shape our state of mind. Personal experiences while interacting within society directly affect our reactions to every encounter as our minds recall previous events. Your self-image is a conceptual picture of yourself, both as a physical body and an individual. A healthy body image means that you know who you are, feel confident in your skin, and understand your full potential.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>There are several individuals who have had a significant influence on my attitude, values, and behaviors as an adolescent. One of them is my parents, who have always been supportive and encouraging, and have taught me the value of hard work and responsibility. They have also instilled in me the importance of honesty, integrity, and respect for others. Another significant individual is my teacher, who has not only taught me academic subjects, but has also guided me in developing important life skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. She has also encouraged me to be open-minded and to value diversity and inclusion.It is important for adolescents to learn about Filipino social values because these values shape the culture and society in which they live. They provide a foundation for how we interact with others and make decisions in our daily lives. Learning about these values helps adolescents understand the expectations and norms of their community, and it helps them develop a sense of belonging and connection to their culture. It can also help adolescents develop a sense of responsibility towards their community and towards others, which is important for their personal and social development.Other people's evaluation of ourselves is important because it helps us understand how we are perceived by others and how we fit into our social environment. It can also serve as a source of feedback and help us identify areas for improvement. However, it is important to remember that other people's evaluations are just one perspective and should not be the sole determinant of our self-worth. It is also important to balance other people's evaluations with our own self-evaluation, as this can help us develop a more well-rounded and accurate understanding of ourselves.One example of a Filipino social value that can be observed up to the present is the value of pakikipagkapwa-tao, which refers to the importance of being considerate and empathetic towards others. This value is evident in the way Filipinos often prioritize the needs and feelings of others, and in the way they often value relationships and social connections. This value can be seen in the way Filipinos often extend hospitality and generosity to others, and in the way they often value harmony and peaceful resolution of conflicts.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Socialization affects us in so many ways far beyond the visible. Our individual socialization patterns shape our mentalities. The things we individual experiences in society directly affect our minds, which explains how our minds register and react to incidents and situations we encounter differently.Socialization is the lifelong process of inheriting and disseminating norms, customs and ideologies, providing an individual with the skills and habits necessary for participating within his or her own society. ... It is the behavioral patterns reinforced by socializing agents of society.Without socialization, we could not have our society and culture. And without social interaction, we could not have socialization. Our example of a socially isolated child was hypothetical, but real-life examples of such children, often called feral.</p><br />
