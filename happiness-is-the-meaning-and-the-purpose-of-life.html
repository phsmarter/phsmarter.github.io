However, when doing so, you should not expect something in return; your intention should be to lessen other people’s misery. “Service to others should be sincere and done from the heart; only then it is fruitful.” Do any trees eat their own fruit? No. This teaches us that human beings should not only use their mind, body and speech for themselves, but also to serve others. When you do this, nature in turn will reward you.</p><p></p><p>Your constant inner intent should be towards helping others.

                            24. II. Explain the following statements:
1. "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes its birth and growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit.
2"Our virtues are not mental faculties. Rather, these are character traits. It is the human being's ability to see to it that his or her action is neither excessive nor inadequate, and as such, is geared towards finding some form of harmonization.""Happiness is something that is desirable in itself. There is no other
3.value that attains the ultimate nature of happiness. All other things are merely requirements for happiness." "Life is worth living when we shall have discovered our very
4.purpose. The very value of life comes from this purpose. To realize this value means to realize our happiness."</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>1. Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes its existence and growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit. From this it is clear that none of the moral virtues arises in us by nature; for nothing that exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature. For instance the stone which by nature moves downwards cannot be habituated to move upwards, not even if one tries to train it by throwing it up ten thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to move downwards, nor can anything else that by nature behaves in one way be trained to behave in another. Neither by nature, then, nor contrary to nature do the virtues arise in us; rather we are adapted by nature to receive them, and are made perfect by habit.</p><p></p><p>2. Our virtues are not just mere mental faculties, but rather they are character traits that define who we truly are. These traits are developed through our actions and experiences, and it is up to us to cultivate them. It is the human being's ability to choose and act upon these virtues that sets us apart from other creatures.</p><p></p><p>3. The ultimate nature of happiness lies in the value that we attach to it. All other things are merely requirements for happiness. True happiness cannot be found in material possessions or external circumstances, but rather in our own mindset and perspective towards life. It is a state of being that is attainable through inner peace and contentment.</p><p></p><p>4. Purpose is the driving force behind our existence. It gives meaning to our lives and shapes our actions. Without purpose, life would be meaningless and directionless. To truly understand the value of life, we must first discover our purpose and work towards fulfilling it. Only then can we realize our full potential and find true fulfillment in life.</p><br />

Turuang mabuti ang mga kabataan at hindi kailangang parusahan ang mga kalalakihan.</p><p>( parang... mula pagkabata sana'y ituro sa mga kalalakihan ang pagrespeto at pagprotekta sa mga babae.. Upang sa paglaki nila'y ito ang moral nila.. Sa halip na makisama sa napakatagal na pambabastos ng napakaraming kalalakihan sa mga babae o kaya'y hindi pagrespeto , ito'y kanilang iiwasan at bigyan ng katapusan sa mga ito.)</p><p>2. Ang pagkilala sa sarili ang pinakamahirap gawin sa buhay. </p><p>(Para sa akin, mula pagkabata ay ating kinikilala ang ating kapuwa ngunit hindi natin nakikilala ang ating sarili. Mula lamang sa opinyon ng iba natin nakikilala ang ating sarili kahit iba mang opinyo'y hindi totoo. Sa paglipas ng panahon, napakaraming 'experience' ang mag-'sheshape' sa iyong pagkatao kaya't papalit palit ang kung sino tayo.. Sabi nga nila, napakahirap ma-achieve ang 'self-love' kumpara sa pagmahal sa kapuwa.)</p><p></p><p>3. Kasiyahan ang ibig sabihin at dahilan ng buhay, ang layunin at ang katapusan ng pag-iiral ng katauhan.</p><p>( Hindi ka namumuhay kapag hindi ka nasisiyahan sa kung anumang meron ka. Kapag ika'y palaging 'diskontento' sa lahat ng bahay, iyong sinasayang ang kung anumang nasaiyo. Hindi mo ma-eenjoy ang buhay kapag hindi mo tanggapin ang kung anumang meron ka. Pagkatapos mong ma-achieve ito, kasiyahan mo ang magpapakita ng kagandahan ng buhay. Kasiyahan natin ang layunin ng ating buhay. smthin like that)</p><p></p><p>4. Ang kahusayan ay hindi isang biyaya. Ito ay isang kakayahang nangangailangan ng pagsasanay.  Hindi tayo nagiging 'tama' dahil tayo'y 'mahusay'. Sa katunayan ay tayo'y 'mahusay' sa paggawa ng 'tama'.</p><p>( Ang pagiging perpekto o mahusay ay hindi sapat lamang upang ika'y matawag na nasa 'tama'.. Walang naipapanganak na perpekto.. Ito'y naaaral. Ngunit hindi dahil kilala ka bilang 'mahusay' ay palagi kang tama... Ngunit kapag ika'y palaging gumagawa ng tama, ikaw ay mahusay... </p><br />
