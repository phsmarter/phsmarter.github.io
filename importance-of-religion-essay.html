I will mark you the brainliest  if you help me thanks.The video tells us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they’re from, what they look and what their religion is. They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</a>

</p><p>
My solution for this inquiry would be culture. Indeed, even before the Spaniards showed up in the Philippines in 1521, the local individuals love dieties. Indeed, even before the Spaniards showed up here, strict convictions were intensely affected by the <strong>Muslims</strong> too that is the reason there are additionally <strong>Filipino Muslims</strong> and a ton of them live in the island of Mindanao since that is the place where Islam was first brought to the Philippines. The Philippines is the biggest catholic and christian country in Asia and third on the planet, story behind that is the point at which the Spaniards showed up in the Philippines, they constrained the locals to change over to <strong>catholicism,</strong> so religion is truly implanted in the way of life.
</p><p>
During the American control of the Philippines, Americans brought <strong>Christiniat</strong>y and a few <strong>Catholics</strong> changed over to Christianity.
</p><p>
It's truly culture. Check out the Thais. Pretty much 95% of Thailand's populace are disciples of Theravada <strong>buddhism</strong> this is on the grounds that Buddhism is identical to Thai personality.
</p><p>Asians are profoundly implanted to culture. Since Philippines is an Asian country, that clarifies the rationale.</p><p>IMPORTNACE OF RELIGION IN LIFE OF THE FILIPINO ://brainly.ph/question/10466542</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</h2><br />

For example, you can look at the gender variable, where the grouping is generally only into two, namely male  and female which are coded 1 and 2.</p><p> The number only serves as a category label, without having a numeric value like a true number.  These numbers do not have the same properties as numbers in general, so that on variables with a nominal scale, mathematical operations such as subtraction, addition, multiplication, etc. cannot be applied.</p><p> 2. <strong>Ordinal scale</strong></p><p> The ordinal scale is one type of measurement scale where the number symbols of the measurement results are in the form of a sequence or level.  Appropriate statistical tests are mode, median, frequency distribution and non-parametric statistics such as rank order correlation.</p><p> 3. <strong>Interval Scale</strong></p><p> Is a type of measurement scale that has characteristics similar to the ordinal scale, which has a certain order.  Another characteristic inherent in the interval scale is the existence of a scale unit.  Appropriate statistical tests are all statistical tests except those that are based on ratios such as the coefficient of variation.</p><p> 4. <strong>Ratio scale</strong></p><p> Ratio scale is a type of measurement scale that produces data of the highest quality.  The difference between the ratio scale and the interval scale lies in the presence of a zero value (based value).  On a ratio scale, zero is absolute, unlike on an interval scale.  The data generated by the ratio scale is ratio data.  There are no restrictions on the appropriate statistical test tools.</p><p></p><p> Learn information regarding level of measurements at https://brainly.ph/question/14034954.</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
