The first level, called troposphere, is the nearest to Earth, about 11 km thick. Most clouds and weather are found in this layer. Next is the stratosphere which is about 11-48 km above the Earth's surface. In it is the ozone layer which absorbs the most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The mesosphere is above the stratosphere in which the atmosphere is very rarefied and the temperature decreases with altitude. The fourth layer is the thermosphere which starts at about 55 km. The temperature is so hot that it cannot be measured by a thermometer. Temperature may be thousands of degrees high. The second to the last is the exosphere, the region beyond the thermosphere. Finally, the ionosphere overlaps the other layers from above the Earth. The air is ionized by the Sun's ultraviolet rays. These ionized layers affect the transmittance and reflectance of radio waves. All in all, there are six levels of the Earth's atmosphere. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. What kind of paragraph is it? How are the sentences arranged? What is the paragraph about?

                            8. .D Read the text. Then, answer the questions that follow. Do this on your paper. The atmosphere is composed of different levels. The first level, called troposphere, is the nearest to Earth, about 11 km thick. Most clouds and weather are found in this layer. Next is the stratosphere which is about 11-48 km above the Earth's surface. In it is the ozone layer which absorbs the most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The mesosphere is above the stratosphere in which the atmosphere is very rarefied and the temperature decreases with altitude. The fourth layer is the thermosphere which starts at about 55 km. The temperature is so hot that it cannot be measured by a thermometer. Temperature may be thousands of degrees high. The second to the last is the exosphere, the region beyond the thermosphere. Finally, the ionosphere overlaps the other layers from above the Earth. The air is ionized by the Sun's ultraviolet rays. These ionized layers affect the transmittance and reflectance of radio waves. All in all, there are six levels of the Earth's atmosphere. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. What kind of paragraph is it? How are the sentences arranged? What is the paragraph about?
