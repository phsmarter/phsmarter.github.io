                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love and hate are the strongest opposites in our dichotomous thinking. Why then unhappy love often turns into deep hate and ruined relationships? A person in love loves everyone. This overwhelmingly positive feeling can change the world dramatically. A person in hate is an enormous destructive force, that creates an abyss of violence and desperation.
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you ever experienced real light of love and real darkness of hate?
</p><p>
</p><p>Love may be more powerful than hate because, as the song goes, love can lead to hate, whereas hate would never, even metaphorically, produce love. Love is more powerful because it gives birth to new positive challenges. Love changes a person, enriches the world, extends the horizons, enhances opportunities, brightens friendships, and deepens emotions. A person in love has a specific aura, a peculiar kind of energy that is given off, scattered in all directions, like the light of the myriads of stars, sliding through ages, celebrating Juliet, Laura, Natasha, Ophelia, Desdemona, all those love stories, powerful in their complexity of feelings and emotions, all about eternal love.
</p><p>
</p><p>But love can fade. It simply disappears, vanishes. So powerful to disappear, or love never goes away. Love’s components are intimacy, passion, and commitment, with all their variations. Consummate love that balances them all is rare. If Romeo and Juliet had lived longer, would they have loved each other with the same intimacy, passion, and commitment? I have doubts. Love is powerful because it can transform. It is, in fact, a transforming process of evolving relationships, in which intimacy remains stable.
</p><p>
</p><p>Who ever lived to hate? Love is powerful because it drives, navigates, directs, and makes our existence meaningful. Hate invites loneliness, whereas love denies it. Hate ruins personality, whereas love opens it up. Hate results in acts of violence, whereas love leads to amazing acts of kindness. Hate destroys, whereas love creates. Hate is war, whereas love is peace.
</p><p>
</p><p>It is impossible “to love to hate”. It is always “love” that gives birth to “love”. That’s why love is more powerful than hate.
</p><p>
</p><p>Discover your powers. Discover love in yourselves. Be sure you’re more powerful to love than to hate. Keep love inside, and all will be always fine.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
