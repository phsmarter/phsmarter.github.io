The changing environment is expected to cause more heat stress, an increase in waterborne diseases, poor air quality, and diseases transmitted by Insects and rodents. Extreme weather events can compound many of these health threats. Ecosystems are also affected by climate change. Changes are also occurring to the ocean. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. 21. First, I always make sure that I clean my hands thoroughly with soap and water. When it becomes dry, I always double check if my face mask and face shield are properly worn, covering my mouth and nose.

We are the image of our parents and running in our veins are the blood of our ancestors who fearlessly fought for our country. We are the reflection of our culture and tradition. Let us be proud of who we are--for we are the product of the magnificent history of our nation. Let us preserve our customs and ways of life for it is the legacy of our brave people. It is true that change is inevitable. 23. Whenever I try to walk around the nature, it is undeniably impossible not to admire and appreciate the beauty of it. The color brought by the shining sun is definitely adorable. Its reflection towards the lake shines like a diamond. The sounds of the chirping bird is like a song massaging my ears, The fresh winds calmly touches my skin as the leaves from the trees fall down to enrich the soil. The butterflies are gracefully flying as if they are excited to see me. 24. Let us support one another. Through good and bad times, we should stand as one family. Towards the betterment of our community, lets us work hand in hand with God's grace. Let us be responsible enough in all of our actions, nurture the nature as it nurtures us, and most especially, love each other purely and genuinely. 25. The long wait is over!

We were so excited since it would be the firstfor so many of us. We were already dreaming of the white sand beach, the crystal clear blue waters and the different foreignerswe were about to see and meet. At last we reached the port where a boat would take us to the island only to be dismayed becauseBoracay Island is closed to the visitors due to the pandemic.(19-20 ) Cats are good pets You don't have to take the cat for a walk everyday like a dog. You do not have to wash cats becausethey know how to clean themselves If you want to go on vacation, you can leave some food and water for your cat and it will beokay.

Do you have a big or small family? How do you connect with them? Beautiful Saturday J. M. Amores It was Saturday. I woke up early and felt very excited. I couldn't wait for the day to be over soon. I wished it was afternoon already. It's a special day of the week. We called it "The Lord's Day." My whole family has a Catholic faith, but we chose to practice this kind of gathering every Saturday to manifest our strong faith to God. It's a simple celebration which includes a little prayer ceremony and a banquet. It's the time for praising and communicating with God and at the same time, be with the whole family on a dinner. We have an extended family and my aunt who was a very religious person was the one initiated the weekly activity. Everyone in the family did his part to give something for the usual preparation. The men did the barbecue, the women made the salad and desserts, while the kids of my age set the table. This was the usual scenario that can be seen in our home every Saturday afternoon. By the time I was thirteen, my aunt died from an ailment. She was gone physically but her legacy remained in us. Every Saturday, as usual, everyone kept on looking forward to the day when all of us gathered in a banquet, not only to eat together nor show our faith but also to commemorate a special person in our lives who had once made this day a beautiful Saturday. </a>

How do you connect with them? Beautiful Saturday J. M. Amores It was Saturday. I woke up early and felt very excited. I couldn't wait for the day to be over soon. I wished it was afternoon already. It's a special day of the week. We called it "The Lord's Day." My whole family has a Catholic faith, but we chose to practice this kind of gathering every Saturday to manifest our strong faith to God. It's a simple celebration which includes a little prayer ceremony and a banquet. It's the time for praising and communicating with God and at the same time, be with the whole family on a dinner. We have an extended family and my aunt who was a very religious person was the one initiated the weekly activity. Everyone in the family did his part to give something for the usual preparation. The men did the barbecue, the women made the salad and desserts, while the kids of my age set the table. This was the usual scenario that can be seen in our home every Saturday afternoon. By the time I was thirteen, my aunt died from an ailment. She was gone physically but her legacy remained in us. Every Saturday, as usual, everyone kept on looking forward to the day when all of us gathered in a banquet, not only to eat together nor show our faith but also to commemorate a special person in our lives who had once made this day a beautiful Saturday. </h2><br />
