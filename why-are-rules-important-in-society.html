It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one's life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position.

To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions.

Is the following characteristic achievable?Explain your answer.Pasagot po</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. It is important to ensure that the governing body of the society is well selected, monitored and reformed (if needed) in order to ensure good governance and effective management of resources and services. This is because the governing body is responsible for making decisions that affect the lives of citizens. If the governing body is not well selected, monitored and reformed, it can lead to a lack of accountability and poor use of resources, which can have a negative impact on society. Furthermore, having a well selected, monitored and reformed governing body can help to ensure that the decision-making process is fair and just, as well as promote public trust in the government.</p><p></p><p>2. Yes, I agree that citizens of a country must be respectful of the institution that governs them. Respect for government and its institutions is essential for the smooth functioning of a society. It is important for citizens to recognize the authority and legitimacy of the government in order to ensure that laws are followed and public order is maintained. Furthermore, respect for government can help to promote civil discourse and discourage violence and extremism.</p><p></p><p>3. It is necessary that the government has the capability to effectively formulate and implement sound policies for the society because this is essential for the well-being of citizens. Sound policies are necessary for economic growth, social progress, and political stability. Furthermore, effective policy implementation can help to ensure that resources are used efficiently and that public services are provided in an equitable manner. We need to ensure the competency of the governing body because it is responsible for making decisions that affect citizens and their lives, and it is important that these decisions are informed and based on sound evidence and expertise.</p><p></p><p>4. Yes, I agree that the government must be participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law. These characteristics are achievable if the government is well organized and properly managed. It is important for the government to involve citizens in the decision-making process and to ensure that there is a consensus on policies and decisions. Furthermore, the government must be accountable and transparent in order to promote public trust and confidence. Additionally, it is important for the government to be responsive to the needs of citizens and ensure that services are provided in an equitable and inclusive manner. Finally, it is essential for the government to abide by the rule of law in order to ensure justice and fairness.</p><br />

How we tag one thing as right or wrong was first determined by what was taught to us growing up. It's how we distinguish black from white. But it shouldn't stop there—we must always ask why. Why one thing is right or wrong. Once you ask the "Why", only then will you have your own perception if it's morally aligned to what your principles and beliefs are or not. That's when you decide it the rules set by someone should be followed or not. So the rules now serves as your basis of how you would act in the society you live in..</p><br />
