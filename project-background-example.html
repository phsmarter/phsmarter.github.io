A. Title: Shopping Spree
B. Subject Covered: Math
Directions/Instructions:
1. Read and understand the given scenario and fill out the table with the required
data below.
2. Follow the procedure carefully to get the desired result.
Shopping Spree
The students of Nemesio I. Yabut Elementary School will be shopping for their immediate
families for this project! It doesn’t matter what your background is or in what you believe.
It is always a great feeling to give back to your favorite people.
Your objective:
Purchase gifts for your immediate family with a budget of Php 10, 000.00
Procedure:
1. Identify and list each member of your household by name and age. The age is
important so that your gift is appropriate. Any person over 18 years of age should
be identified by “adult”.
2. Budget the amount you can spend on each family member. Take Php 10, 000 and
divide it amongst the number of people in your immediate family (not including
yourself). This will represent the amount of money you can spend on each person.
For example, if there are 12 people in your family, you want to know what 1/12 of
Php 10, 000 is. You can do that by dividing Php 10,000 ÷ 12).
3. Write the budgeted amount for each person next to their name using a table.
4. Search the internet using a variety of websites (Lazada, Shoppee, etc.) to find a gift
for each member. Make sure to capture the picture or do a print screen of your gift
to prove your price. Paste them below.
5. List each gift and the price on the table
6. Total the amount spent after you have selected your gifts for every family member.
7. Check your total to make sure that you have stayed within your budget.

Nature of the Project:Encouraging community members to Empower themselves to be a great individual through establishing seminar workshopsC. Target community/ institution:Youth of the community ages 13-18 years of ageD. Background:Dr. Jose Rizal stated that the youth is the hope of the future, but what will happen to our future if the youth no longer have a desire to be great? There are scenarios showing that the youth are the ones who are committing crime and not doing what they should perform as part of the community. The reason why I chose this is to address what their needs are and how to encourage them to empower themselves and show their greatness for them to be able to be a contributor to society.​</a>

                                            What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight
4. Feed Conversion Rate
• A satisfactory conversion ratio should be 1 kg live weight gain for 3 to
5 kg of feed consumed by an animal.
5. Costs and Returns of Production
• All expenses and sales recorded for one year to compute the returns
on your investment (ROI) at the end of the year.</a>

Directions/Instructions:
1. Read and understand the given scenario and fill out the table with the required
data below.
2. Follow the procedure carefully to get the desired result.
Shopping Spree
The students of Nemesio I. Yabut Elementary School will be shopping for their immediate
families for this project! It doesn’t matter what your background is or in what you believe.
It is always a great feeling to give back to your favorite people.
Your objective:
Purchase gifts for your immediate family with a budget of Php 10, 000.00
Procedure:
1. Identify and list each member of your household by name and age. The age is
important so that your gift is appropriate. Any person over 18 years of age should
be identified by “adult”.
2. Budget the amount you can spend on each family member. Take Php 10, 000 and
divide it amongst the number of people in your immediate family (not including
yourself). This will represent the amount of money you can spend on each person.
For example, if there are 12 people in your family, you want to know what 1/12 of
Php 10, 000 is. You can do that by dividing Php 10,000 ÷ 12).
3. Write the budgeted amount for each person next to their name using a table.
4. Search the internet using a variety of websites (Lazada, Shoppee, etc.) to find a gift
for each member. Make sure to capture the picture or do a print screen of your gift
to prove your price. Paste them below.
5. List each gift and the price on the table
6. Total the amount spent after you have selected your gifts for every family member.
7. Check your total to make sure that you have stayed within your budget.

                            11. example nga po A. Project title:"Empower yourself to be a Great One"B. Nature of the Project:Encouraging community members to Empower themselves to be a great individual through establishing seminar workshopsC. Target community/ institution:Youth of the community ages 13-18 years of ageD. Background:Dr. Jose Rizal stated that the youth is the hope of the future, but what will happen to our future if the youth no longer have a desire to be great? There are scenarios showing that the youth are the ones who are committing crime and not doing what they should perform as part of the community. The reason why I chose this is to address what their needs are and how to encourage them to empower themselves and show their greatness for them to be able to be a contributor to society.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>That is a great project idea! I think that this project could be successful in helping the youth of your community become great individuals. You will want to create a plan that breaks down the steps of the project into smaller, achievable goals. You will also want to consider the resources available to you, such as volunteers, funding, and materials. Additionally, you will want to think about how you will measure the success of the project. This could include things like surveys or interviews with the target audience after the project is complete. Finally, you will want to come up with a timeline for completing the project. Good luck!</p><br />

                            22. What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight
4. Feed Conversion Rate
• A satisfactory conversion ratio should be 1 kg live weight gain for 3 to
5 kg of feed consumed by an animal.
5. Costs and Returns of Production
• All expenses and sales recorded for one year to compute the returns
on your investment (ROI) at the end of the year.</h2><br />
