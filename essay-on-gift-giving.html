In conclusion, I am sure you understand now why I love Christmas: the cerflowing love of the Lord manifests within our actions.
In addition, during the Christmas season, families are closer. It doesn't matter how extravagant the festivity is or how much food is on someone's plate, what matters the most is the presence of our loved ones. Knowing that this season can bring people together is one of the biggest blessings we could ever receive.
To begin with the spirit of Christmas brings a different feeling to everyone: Young or old, rich or poor. The excitement that sparkles in the children's eyes upon receiving the long-awaited gift from their ninang and ninong is truly something remarkable.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>If I were to give Jesus a gift, I would give him a warm blanket. Throughout history, blankets have been used to provide warmth, comfort, and protection from the elements. They are a symbol of nurturing and care, and offering one to Jesus would show our appreciation for his teachings on love, compassion, and kindness towards others. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Jesus was born in a manger, surrounded by animals, and possibly slept on hay. A soft, warm blanket, would provide Jesus with a moment of comfort and rest, and show him that we, as humans, appreciate his sacrifices and love him for it. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a gift is a tangible expression of gratitude and love, and a warm blanket would be a beautiful testament to our appreciation of Jesus' teachings, his selflessness, and his compassion for humanity.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In “The Two Gifts,” the story of two travelers, the first traveler’s generosity and the second traveler’s compassion serve to illustrate a theme of charity. Both travelers have a chance encounter with a poor woman in need and each of them respond in a different way. The first traveler gives the woman money, a tangible gift, while the second traveler provides her with a meal, an intangible gift. </p><p></p><p>The first traveler’s motivations are clear and straightforward; he seeks to help the woman by giving her money. He is aware that her need is great and his gift is immediate, but it is also limited. The traveler is “ashamed” of his own wealth while the woman is “poor and destitute” and he feels compelled to give her money to ease her suffering. His gift is an act of charity, a way of easing her burden and giving her a tangible benefit. </p><p></p><p>The second traveler’s motivations are more subtle. While he does not give the woman money directly, he does provide her with a meal and shows her kindness and compassion. He recognizes that the woman’s need is greater than his own, and he is moved by her plight</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><p></p><br />
