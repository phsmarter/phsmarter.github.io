                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-care is about honoring ourselves, and in doing so we say to ourselves and to everyone else: I matter. The other extreme is being selfish. Being completely selfish requires always putting your needs first and foremost, even stepping on others to get what you want. What we do recommend is “self-interest" or "self care” and what this means is taking good care of yourself, even putting your needs first at times, while considering the needs of others. The best balance in relationships is to give and receive. Your own needs, desires and ideas are just as important as anyone else’s. </p><p></p><p>Self-care is about honoring ourselves and our potential. Women are even more prone to struggle with this notion because they have historically been encouraged to put the needs of others before their own. Not practicing self care has a price.</p><p></p><p>Self-care does not come naturally or easily for many. Begin today to take good care of yourself. Take time to do things you enjoy, give yourself rewards, take time to exercise, eat healthy, take a virtual yoga class, schedule Facetime with people who make you feel good, and practice saying “NO.” Those who have a problem saying “NO” have difficulty affirming themselves and exercising their ability to form and maintain personal boundaries. The inability to say “NO” may be linked to the self-esteem you think you earn by doing things for others. </p><p></p><p>Since your self-esteem seems to depend on the things that you do for other people, your reluctance to say “NO” is understandable. When people say “YES” when they really want to say “NO”, self-esteem erodes. Such behavior conveys the attitude, “your feelings are more important than mine.”  Pay close attention to your own needs and wants and listen to your “inner voice.”</p><p></p><p>Be especially mindful during this pandemic and isolation time. It is easy to get caught up with the entire family at home and lose yourself. If you are not okay, no one else in your family will be okay. </p><p></p><p>Giving yourself permission to take some time alone is healthy and will recharge you so that you can be present with your family and loved ones. Just because everyone is home does not mean you cannot set healthy boundaries and establish appropriate space for self and others. Seek a healthy balance.</p><p></p><p>Your sense of self-worth helps you to trust your own judgment and make better decisions, which are important leadership qualities that can help you advance in your career. Self-worth can lend you the confidence to run meetings, support other team members and have greater autonomy at work.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>(not sure sa answer po)</p><p>ikaw na po bahala hihi.</p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The statement "the unexamined life is not worth living" means that a life without introspection or self-reflection is not fulfilling. As a senior high school learner preparing for college, it is essential to reflect on your goals, aspirations, and values to determine what you want to accomplish in college and beyond. Reflecting on your strengths, weaknesses, interests, and experiences can help you identify your passions, which can guide your college and career choices.</p><p></p><p>The second statement, "he who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how," suggests that having a sense of purpose or a reason for living can help one persevere through difficult times. As a senior high school learner preparing for college, it is important to identify your purpose or reason for pursuing higher education. This could be a desire to make a difference in the world, to gain knowledge and skills to pursue a specific career, or to challenge yourself intellectually. Having a clear sense of purpose can motivate you to work hard and persist through challenges that may arise during the college application process or in college itself.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Im not sure if this is for an essay.
