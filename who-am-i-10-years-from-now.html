                                            Hello. I'm Liana. I died in an accident when I was 6 years old. You must read this message completely or you will have bad luck for the rest of your life. I am probably very close to you right now and I ask you to share this message with 20 more people. Otherwise, you will die. Example 1: There is a man named Meson, he is reading this message. But he laughed and didn't share it with 20 people, so at 2am, he died in an accident. Death is identical to me. I did it! Example 2: One has a young girl named Alisean. He also received this message but he only shared it with 10 people and he had nightmares for the rest of his life One more example: There are three close friends and their names are Tini Ly, Miin dukki and Anna An. They had a blast when they received these messages and they immediately sent them to 20 people. So they become lucky people. They are loved by everyone, and their scores are also very high. So who do you want to be? Send it to 20 people for good luck or you will be unlucky or die. The game will start from the moment you read these messages. GOOD LUCK ​</a>

1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.
7. Life is beautiful.
Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,
mannerisms, outfits, and ideas stun her family and friends. This causes emotional
unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.

In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul and the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos. I am, therefore, happy to know of the integration of the Filipino youth and that the Filipino youth is now on the march. The question is: Where is it going? Is it marching with irresistible will and determination toward progress and civilization, peace and order, and the prosperity and happiness of the Fatherland? If it is, I, as the chosen head of our nation and our people, heartily welcome it and bid it Godspeed.
It is trite saying that the future belongs to youth, especially to those dynamic, aggressive and self-confident young men and women who have foresight. Thus, they have the bounden duty to ensure it. So much faith the greatest Filipino patriot and hero, Rizal, had in the youth of the land that while he was still in his teens, he dedicated to it his prize winning poem entitled “To the Filipino Youth,” and he called the Filipino youth not without reason and justification “Fair hope of my Fatherland.”
Several years later, when Rizal was in Madrid, he thought again of the Filipino youth. On the occasion of the signal honor and distinction conferred upon the famous Filipino painter Juan Luna when one of his paintings was awarded the highest prize in the artistic world, Rizal offered a touching toast. He expressed the fervent hope that the worthy and commendable examples of Juan Luna, and Resurrection, another famed Filipino painter, will be imitated or emulated by the Filipino youth. In the course of a few years that youth had become to him more than the “fair hope of my fatherland”; it had become the “sacred hope of my Fatherland.”
Rizal’s fair and sacred hope is represented by the young men and women of today, by you, the Filipino youth on the march, you who will be either the leaders and masters of your country and your country’s fate tomorrow or the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people more ambitious and far-seeing than you, men with vision, with courage, and with an indomitable will to succeed whatever be the obstacles.
Inspired by the same noble sentiment, the late Dr. Rafael Palma, builder of the University of the Philippines, dedicated to the same youth, to the same “fair and sacred hope” of the Fatherland, his last work and masterpiece, his life-size biography of Rizal. In his dedicatory remarks he gave voice to his abiding faith and confidence in the ability of the Filipino young men and women to make good.
Have they made good or are they making good? Were Rizal living today would he be proud of them? Would he say, if he could see them from beyond the tomb, that he did not die in vain, that his country’s sacred and beautiful hope has not disappointed him and those who like him had given their full measure of sacrifice for the glory of their Fatherland?
How fare the youth of the land? Are they planting the seeds that will make their country great? Do they realize the serious problems that now confront the Republic of the Philippines, which is their Republic, and are they contributing to the fullest extent to the solution of such problems? Are they putting their strong and broad shoulders on the wheel of progress and prosperity? Are they helping actively in the complete restoration of peace and order in their country and in the gigantic reconstruction work which both the people and the government must undertake? Are they doing their duty as citizens of the Republic, working for the common happiness and welfare of their respective communities?
As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap the fruits of progress and tranquillity? Man is the archetype of society. Both society and the nation grow as the individuals grow. Unless our youth prepare for the future, there will be no future for them.
“I want to let those who deny us every feeling of patriotism,” wrote Rizal, “that we know how to die for our duty and for our convictions. What matters death if one dies for what one loves, for one’s country, and for those one adores?”
In one of his parting letters he wrote “My future, my life, my joys, all I have sacrificed for my love for her”—referring to the Philippines. “Whatever be my fate, I will die blessing her and wishing her the dawn of her redemption.” That, you will agree, is a wonderful sentiment. Does the Filipino youth of today feel and cherish it?</a>

I am probably very close to you right now and I ask you to share this message with 20 more people. Otherwise, you will die. Example 1: There is a man named Meson, he is reading this message. But he laughed and didn't share it with 20 people, so at 2am, he died in an accident. Death is identical to me. I did it! Example 2: One has a young girl named Alisean. He also received this message but he only shared it with 10 people and he had nightmares for the rest of his life One more example: There are three close friends and their names are Tini Ly, Miin dukki and Anna An. They had a blast when they received these messages and they immediately sent them to 20 people. So they become lucky people. They are loved by everyone, and their scores are also very high. So who do you want to be? Send it to 20 people for good luck or you will be unlucky or die. The game will start from the moment you read these messages. GOOD LUCK ​</h2><br />

1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.

he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I

5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.

Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,

looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.

poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own

eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.

                            21. Find 10 Active and Passive sentences in President Laurel's Speech.
In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul and the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos. I am, therefore, happy to know of the integration of the Filipino youth and that the Filipino youth is now on the march. The question is: Where is it going? Is it marching with irresistible will and determination toward progress and civilization, peace and order, and the prosperity and happiness of the Fatherland? If it is, I, as the chosen head of our nation and our people, heartily welcome it and bid it Godspeed.
It is trite saying that the future belongs to youth, especially to those dynamic, aggressive and self-confident young men and women who have foresight. Thus, they have the bounden duty to ensure it. So much faith the greatest Filipino patriot and hero, Rizal, had in the youth of the land that while he was still in his teens, he dedicated to it his prize winning poem entitled “To the Filipino Youth,” and he called the Filipino youth not without reason and justification “Fair hope of my Fatherland.”
Several years later, when Rizal was in Madrid, he thought again of the Filipino youth. On the occasion of the signal honor and distinction conferred upon the famous Filipino painter Juan Luna when one of his paintings was awarded the highest prize in the artistic world, Rizal offered a touching toast. He expressed the fervent hope that the worthy and commendable examples of Juan Luna, and Resurrection, another famed Filipino painter, will be imitated or emulated by the Filipino youth. In the course of a few years that youth had become to him more than the “fair hope of my fatherland”; it had become the “sacred hope of my Fatherland.”
Rizal’s fair and sacred hope is represented by the young men and women of today, by you, the Filipino youth on the march, you who will be either the leaders and masters of your country and your country’s fate tomorrow or the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people more ambitious and far-seeing than you, men with vision, with courage, and with an indomitable will to succeed whatever be the obstacles.
Inspired by the same noble sentiment, the late Dr. Rafael Palma, builder of the University of the Philippines, dedicated to the same youth, to the same “fair and sacred hope” of the Fatherland, his last work and masterpiece, his life-size biography of Rizal. In his dedicatory remarks he gave voice to his abiding faith and confidence in the ability of the Filipino young men and women to make good.
Have they made good or are they making good? Were Rizal living today would he be proud of them? Would he say, if he could see them from beyond the tomb, that he did not die in vain, that his country’s sacred and beautiful hope has not disappointed him and those who like him had given their full measure of sacrifice for the glory of their Fatherland?
How fare the youth of the land? Are they planting the seeds that will make their country great? Do they realize the serious problems that now confront the Republic of the Philippines, which is their Republic, and are they contributing to the fullest extent to the solution of such problems? Are they putting their strong and broad shoulders on the wheel of progress and prosperity? Are they helping actively in the complete restoration of peace and order in their country and in the gigantic reconstruction work which both the people and the government must undertake? Are they doing their duty as citizens of the Republic, working for the common happiness and welfare of their respective communities?
As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap the fruits of progress and tranquillity? Man is the archetype of society. Both society and the nation grow as the individuals grow. Unless our youth prepare for the future, there will be no future for them.
“I want to let those who deny us every feeling of patriotism,” wrote Rizal, “that we know how to die for our duty and for our convictions. What matters death if one dies for what one loves, for one’s country, and for those one adores?”
In one of his parting letters he wrote “My future, my life, my joys, all I have sacrificed for my love for her”—referring to the Philippines. “Whatever be my fate, I will die blessing her and wishing her the dawn of her redemption.” That, you will agree, is a wonderful sentiment. Does the Filipino youth of today feel and cherish it?</h2><br />
