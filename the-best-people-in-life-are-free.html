People who have struggled with substance abuse have often found it extremely difficult to quit due to the physical and/or mental addiction.BODYDo you or someone you know have a drug problem?people from all walks of life can experience problems with their drug use, regardless of age,race background, or the reason they started using drugs in the first place. Some people experiment with recreational drugs cut of curiosity, to have a good time, because friends are doing it, or to ease problems such as stress, anxiety, or depression.INTROWhen drug use becomes drug abuse or addictionOf course,drug use -either illegal or prescription - doesn't automatically lead to abuse. Some people are able to use recreational or prescription drugs without experiencing negative effects, while others find that substance use takes a serious toll on their health and well being similarly, there is no specific point at which drug use moves from casual to problematicDrug abuse and addiction is less about the type or amount of the substance consumed or the frequency of your drug use, and more about the consequences of that drug use. If your drug use is causing problems in your life—at work, school, home, or in your relationships—you likely have a drug abuse or addiction problem.If you’re worried about your own or a loved one’s drug use, learning how drug abuse and addiction develops—and why it can have such a powerful hold—will give you a better understanding of how to best deal with the problem and regain control of your life. Recognizing that you have a problem is the first step on the road to recovery, one that takes tremendous courage and strength. Facing your problem without minimizing the issue or making excuses can feel frightening and overwhelming, but recovery is within reach. If you're ready to seek help, you can overcome your addiction and build a satisfying, drug-free life for yourself​</a>

                                            My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

Pa summarize po ng body and introduction para may malagay sa conclusion huhuhuThesis statement: Drug abuse is a complex disease that needs enduring and extensive treatment. People who have struggled with substance abuse have often found it extremely difficult to quit due to the physical and/or mental addiction.BODYDo you or someone you know have a drug problem?people from all walks of life can experience problems with their drug use, regardless of age,race background, or the reason they started using drugs in the first place. Some people experiment with recreational drugs cut of curiosity, to have a good time, because friends are doing it, or to ease problems such as stress, anxiety, or depression.INTROWhen drug use becomes drug abuse or addictionOf course,drug use -either illegal or prescription - doesn't automatically lead to abuse. Some people are able to use recreational or prescription drugs without experiencing negative effects, while others find that substance use takes a serious toll on their health and well being similarly, there is no specific point at which drug use moves from casual to problematicDrug abuse and addiction is less about the type or amount of the substance consumed or the frequency of your drug use, and more about the consequences of that drug use. If your drug use is causing problems in your life—at work, school, home, or in your relationships—you likely have a drug abuse or addiction problem.If you’re worried about your own or a loved one’s drug use, learning how drug abuse and addiction develops—and why it can have such a powerful hold—will give you a better understanding of how to best deal with the problem and regain control of your life. Recognizing that you have a problem is the first step on the road to recovery, one that takes tremendous courage and strength. Facing your problem without minimizing the issue or making excuses can feel frightening and overwhelming, but recovery is within reach. If you're ready to seek help, you can overcome your addiction and build a satisfying, drug-free life for yourself​</h2><br />
                        CONCLUSION<br />Drug abuse is a serious problem that is recognized by people from all walks of life. People who abuse drugs often experience physical and/or mental addiction, making it difficult to quit. However, it is possible to overcome drug abuse and addiction with the right help and support. Recognizing the problem and having the courage to seek help is the first step on the road to recovery and a healthier, drug-free life.<p>Summarize of Body:</p><p></p>People of all ages, backgrounds, and reasons for using drugs can develop problems with drug use. Some people use drugs recreationally, while others may use them to cope with stress, anxiety, or depression. It is possible for anyone to develop a drug problem.<p></p><p>Summarize of Intro:</p><p></p>Drug abuse and addiction is not determined by the type or amount of the substance used or the frequency of drug use, but rather by the consequences of that drug use. If drug use is causing problems in a person's life, such as at work, school, or in relationships, it may be a sign of drug abuse or addiction. Recognizing that there is a problem is the first step towards recovery, and seeking help is necessary to overcome addiction and build a drug-free life.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            25. My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.
