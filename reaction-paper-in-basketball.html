                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research Paper Basketball is regarded as the ultimate team sport because of how much teamwork is required to win. This sport is played with 2 teams of 5 people each. Both teams try to score more than the other team by putting the ball in the basket more times without fouling or breaking any rules. Basketball is played all over the world, it is one of the most popular sports of its time. Basketball is one of the only sports to be entirely created in the U.S. It is played all the way from middle school to professionally in the NBA (National Basketball Association). Since its creation, basketball has evolved greatly in rules, the addition of the 3-point line and who all plays it. Basketball was invented in the U.S in 1891. James Naismith was…show more content…
</p><p>Naismith had to create a game that would pique the men’s interest, but not injure them for the upcoming football season. Naismith drew up the 13 original rules of basketball and asked a janitor for 2 rectangular boxes. The janitor came back with 2 peach baskets so Naismith nailed them up 10 feet high on opposite ends of the gym to be the baskets. There were 2 teams of 6 people each trying to score on the opposing goal. “Naismith tossed the ball, and the game of ‘basket ball’ was born.” Basketball caught on quick and many people mailed Naismith asking for the rules so they could play it themselves. Naismith achieved his goal of entertaining the young men and created a soon-to-be worldwide sport (Where Basketball was Invented:The History of Basketball). The rules of basketball have changed dramatically, but the first 13 rules are mostly still in place. Rule #1 and 2: The ball may be thrown or batted in any direction with one or both hands. Rule #3: A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which they catche…show more content…
</p><p>The 3-point line was first implemented in the ABL(American Basketball Association) but the ABL quickly went away as did the 3-point line. After much debate, the NCAA(National Collegiate Athletic Association) added the 3-point line to all of its courts. High Schools followed the NCAA’s lead a year later. The 3-point line is different for each level of play. For the NBA it’s 22 feet to 23 feet and 9 inches away from the basket, for the WNBA the line is 20 feet and 6 inches away from the basket, for the NCAA men’s the line is 20 feet and 9 inch line and the NCAA women and high schools lines are 19 feet and 9 inches from the basket. Players had to adjust to the addition of the 3-point line, it changed everything. Players had to guard other players at the 3-point line unlike they had done for their entire careers. 3-pointers made the entire game </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
