                                            Study Habits play a significant part in the academic life of every student. It is one of the ingredients thatcompletes to the overall success of the child in school. A good study habit in the formative years of the child couldbe carried on by the child throughout his life. That is why, the formation of the best study habit early is veryimportant to know especially among parents and teachers.Without study habit, a person may not grow and become self-limiting in life. Many areas of our life require ahabitual act of doing things. As the adage goes "Your habit becomes your destiny", a life worth living for is a productof an everyday choices that we make.According to Robinson (2000) the keys to better learning and better academic performance in schools aregood teachers, good study environment, the course of study, parents' cooperation, high quality books and, the mostimportant, the study habits. Investigating the nature of study habits is important because factors related to studyingsuch as motivation and specific study techniques have been linked to academic success.Many students fail not because they lack ability, but because they do not have adequate study skills (Menzel1982). Study habit is the tendency of a student to learn in a systematic and efficient way, when opportunity is given.It is also defined as the devotion of time and attention to acquire information or knowledge especially from booksor in other words, it's the pursuit of academic knowledge by a detailed investigation of a subject or situation (OxfordDictionary &amp; Thesaurus of English Language, 2003).Thus, in order to improve academic performance of students, it seems essential to improve their study habitswithout which desired outcomes cannot be achieved. Development of good study habits in children depends uponthe combined efforts of parents and teachers (Kizlik, 2001).Robinson (2000) found that certain bad study habits result in poor academic performance, whereas certaingood study habits result in high academic performance. Creemers and Reynold (2000), on the basis of data of theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, demonstrated a positive relationship between good study habits andacademic performance of 8th and 9th Grade students.Although there is a substantial amount of research available on the study habits and academic performancethere is no available research on this topic in Dumaran Central School. Other researchers have also pointed towardsa positive relationship between study habits and academic performance (Fatima, 1967; Siddique, 1989). Studies inPakistan have revealed the relationship of academic performance with intelligence and emotional intelligence(Shujja, 2008; Khalid &amp; Ahmad, 2009).These various studies related to the study habit and academic performance of the students lead to theformulation of this research topic. The aimed of this study is to find out the study habits of pupils in Dumaran CentralSchool and how it affects to their academic performance.Answer the following:1. What was the excerpt all about?2.

                            4. Study Habits play a significant part in the academic life of every student. It is one of the ingredients thatcompletes to the overall success of the child in school. A good study habit in the formative years of the child couldbe carried on by the child throughout his life. That is why, the formation of the best study habit early is veryimportant to know especially among parents and teachers.Without study habit, a person may not grow and become self-limiting in life. Many areas of our life require ahabitual act of doing things. As the adage goes "Your habit becomes your destiny", a life worth living for is a productof an everyday choices that we make.According to Robinson (2000) the keys to better learning and better academic performance in schools aregood teachers, good study environment, the course of study, parents' cooperation, high quality books and, the mostimportant, the study habits. Investigating the nature of study habits is important because factors related to studyingsuch as motivation and specific study techniques have been linked to academic success.Many students fail not because they lack ability, but because they do not have adequate study skills (Menzel1982). Study habit is the tendency of a student to learn in a systematic and efficient way, when opportunity is given.It is also defined as the devotion of time and attention to acquire information or knowledge especially from booksor in other words, it's the pursuit of academic knowledge by a detailed investigation of a subject or situation (OxfordDictionary &amp; Thesaurus of English Language, 2003).Thus, in order to improve academic performance of students, it seems essential to improve their study habitswithout which desired outcomes cannot be achieved. Development of good study habits in children depends uponthe combined efforts of parents and teachers (Kizlik, 2001).Robinson (2000) found that certain bad study habits result in poor academic performance, whereas certaingood study habits result in high academic performance. Creemers and Reynold (2000), on the basis of data of theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, demonstrated a positive relationship between good study habits andacademic performance of 8th and 9th Grade students.Although there is a substantial amount of research available on the study habits and academic performancethere is no available research on this topic in Dumaran Central School. Other researchers have also pointed towardsa positive relationship between study habits and academic performance (Fatima, 1967; Siddique, 1989). Studies inPakistan have revealed the relationship of academic performance with intelligence and emotional intelligence(Shujja, 2008; Khalid &amp; Ahmad, 2009).These various studies related to the study habit and academic performance of the students lead to theformulation of this research topic. The aimed of this study is to find out the study habits of pupils in Dumaran CentralSchool and how it affects to their academic performance.Answer the following:1. What was the excerpt all about?2.

It is a way of looking at how social norms and power structures impact on the lives and opportunities available to different groups of men and women. Globally, more women than men live in poverty. Women are also less likely than men to receive basic education and to be appointed to a political position nationally and internationally. Understanding that men and women, boys and girls experience poverty differently and face different barriers in accessing services, economic resources and political opportunities helps to target interventions.</p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Pre-calculus is important as it blends together all of the concepts and skills that must be mastered prior to enrollment in a college level calculus course. Although you don't really need to take Pre-Calculus, for instance, some people took Calculus w/o Pre-Calculus and did fine. But you have to learn the Trig functions on your own to keep up, because if you are not able to keep up with the lessons that are being taught in calculus, you may run the risk of falling behind the rest of the class.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>  Chores: Few of us enjoy doing them, but for a household to run smoothly these tedious and time-consuming tasks must get done. It’s a given that the adults will do their part around the house, but when it comes to assigning housework to children, there’s some debate.</p><p></p><p>Many parents want to preserve childhood for as long as possible, letting the “kids be kids” and enjoy plenty of playtime while they’re still young. Others may see children as less capable, preferring to finish the housework as quickly and efficiently as possible. These arguments make sense, but they also overlook the many positive benefits of giving kids chores.</p><p></p><p>Consider these seven reasons why children should help out around the house:</p><p></p><p>1. Chores help teach life skills. They’re young now, but they won’t be kids forever! Laundry, cooking and budgeting are just some of the skills your kids will need once they finally move out. These are also things that schools do not fully teach, making learning them at home even more important.</p><p></p><p>2. Chores help kids learn responsibility and self-reliance. Assigning children regular chores helps teach them responsibility. Tasks that personally affect your kids, such as cleaning their room or doing their own laundry, can help them become more self-reliant at the same time. Your kids or grandkids may also take pride in being considered mature enough to take care of themselves.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps:)</p><br />

The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating. The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets. The pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. As breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and nutrition of millions of women and men are under threat, with those in low-income countries, particularly the most marginalized populations, which include small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being hardest hit.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
