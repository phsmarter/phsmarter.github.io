 This time of the pandemic, online learning is used as one of the modes of learning delivery. Just like traditional learning, online learning also requires a great amount of work. Both emphasize giving and receiving feedback from students and teachers and that they both have to manage their time wisely to accomplish their tasks related to the teaching- learning process. Moreover, the challenges and rewards are the same in each environment. However, online learning includes both synchronous and asynchronous learning. Students need an internet connection to submit the activities. In the traditional classroom, students use paper and pen to complete the given tasks. Students' voices and raising of hands are also observed by the teachers during recitations. Given the analogy between the two, it is emphasized that education is very possible despite all circumstances that may happen and that the quality of education will not be sacrificed.</a>

Analogous relationship-5 points Organization-3 points Mechanics-2 points TOTAL-10 points EXAMPLE: Raising children and Gardening Raising children is similar to gardening. The children's fragile bodies need to be fed with food full of nutrients so that they will grow healthy and strong. Likewise, the bodies of plants which are just sprouting need to be watered and exposed to enough sunshine for them to grow and live. Moreover, both plants and children should be nurtured not only with nutrients, but also with overflowing love and care. 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>If I can compare my life with one object, I'd instead compare it to a <strong>rock</strong>. People think that being strong like a rock and being hard is an essential aspect of survival. But the reality is I am a rock who survives amidst all of the circumstances and hindrances because no one notices that I am coping with these fights. Little did they know I am enduring alone like a rock when all those problems that will come, like rain. I was pouring and flowing fast, not minding what I could feel from that moment. I am in the cold, misled, but they don't mind since they knew I was a rock. A rock that was created and made by God to survive naturally because it is my nature. They think I can handle it all alone. When the truth is, I am not. I was in pain with those trampled with many people who believe that I am just nothing. Little did they know, I was hurting too; I was suffering. People think that because it is our nature, it means we have to act as it is. But the reality doesn't mean this is how we are created. We shouldn't work as if we are for that. We should always remind ourselves to be gentle and speak up when things go wrong.<p></p><p></p><br />

 This time of the pandemic, online learning is used as one of the modes of learning delivery. Just like traditional learning, online learning also requires a great amount of work. Both emphasize giving and receiving feedback from students and teachers and that they both have to manage their time wisely to accomplish their tasks related to the teaching- learning process. Moreover, the challenges and rewards are the same in each environment. However, online learning includes both synchronous and asynchronous learning. Students need an internet connection to submit the activities. In the traditional classroom, students use paper and pen to complete the given tasks. Students' voices and raising of hands are also observed by the teachers during recitations. Given the analogy between the two, it is emphasized that education is very possible despite all circumstances that may happen and that the quality of education will not be sacrificed.</h2><br />

Our mothers are as strong and beautiful as plants. My brother is like a monkey because he constantly imitates me. My older brother is like a lion in that he is always sleeping, but he has complete control over the house.
