This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                            5. For items 6-10, read the passage below to answer the following items. It is odd, but in our family, love always began with a fall of some form or another. This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.
