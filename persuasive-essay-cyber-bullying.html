                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyber bullying is a serious problem in today's digital world, and it is a form of harassment that can have long-lasting effects on the victim. As more and more people spend their time online, cyber bullying has become a pervasive issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. In this essay, I will argue that cyber bullying is a harmful and destructive behavior that must be stopped.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, cyber bullying can have serious psychological effects on the victim. It can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Many victims of cyber bullying also experience social isolation and difficulty forming relationships, which can have a lasting impact on their well-being.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, cyber bullying can lead to physical harm. In some cases, victims of cyber bullying have been driven to self-harm or suicide. This is a tragic outcome that is entirely preventable if we take action to stop cyber bullying.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, cyber bullying can have a negative impact on academic performance. Students who are bullied may struggle to focus on their studies, leading to poor grades and lower academic achievement.</p><p></p><p>In order to combat cyber bullying, we must take a multifaceted approach. Parents, teachers, and other adults must be vigilant in monitoring the online activity of young people and take action if they suspect cyber bullying is occurring. Social media companies must also take responsibility for monitoring their platforms and responding quickly to reports of cyber bullying. We can also promote awareness and education about the impact of cyber bullying through public awareness campaigns and school programs.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cyber bullying is a destructive behavior that can have serious long-term consequences. It is up to all of us to take action to prevent and stop cyber bullying in our communities. By working together, we can create a safer and more positive digital world for all.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>low bat na ako huhhhuhh</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        The cause of bullying is from people that are judgemental and insecure of others . From the people that have bad attitudes. From the people that they only want is attention. The effect of bullying is pain,depression,suicidal. Because of bullying, they are hurting enough to suicide.What is bullying? Bullying is a certain way of complimenting someone by rudeness or tragically, bullying means telling someone how you feel about them in an inappropriate way or in short term, hurting them. Taking a compliment is good they say, but what if that compliment hurts one person? That's an example of bullying. And a cause of this sudden thing is either lackness of his/her parents teaching or his/her parents taught a wrong doing. A person who had experienced this kind of doing can result to bad habits, bad manners, and even suicide as well. According to surveys of bullying, almost half of the world's population has experience bullying. And as time passes, it gets worse. As it gets worse, the effect of bullying can take away lives of thousands and maybe millions of people a day, week, month or a year. Now, a cause of bullying is dangerous but can be stopped. Though the effect of it will not result in a positive way.<br />

                        The process of harassing someone through applying forces, abusing verbally or non-verbally, threatening, and using other means of violence to make someone do a piece of work, or just for the pleasure of the assaulter is known as bullying.<br /><br />Bullying has been a common practice on colleges, where the seniors assault the juniors to show them their power, and the privileges of being seniors. Generally, bullying is done by the strong people on the weaker sections of people.<br /><br />These people appear to be strong based on their power (both physical and intellectual) and position. These people bully the weaker people for mainly two reasons; to make their presence felt or to make them do some unpleasant work.<br /><br />Bullying is not only common in colleges but also schools, offices and other places. A person who is bullied regularly or has been bullied before, suffer huge mental trauma and physical trauma. Some people lose their mental and physical steadiness due to these bullies.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Bullying is an aggressive behavior that is hurtful and often cause embarrassment and intimidates the person being bullied. This can happen to anyone. The people being bullied often feels powerless and alone. Bullying isn’t just punching someone in the face or someone calling horrible names. Bullying is a lot more than that. Bullying isn’t new to the society, it existed long ago but thanks to the development of technology people especially teenagers are now being bullied at home. Cyberbullying is a serious problem that can leave the victims feeling helpless and overwhelmed. This has become one of the most difficult issues to resolve in our society today.</p><p></p><p><strong>If</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you </strong><strong>feel</strong><strong> </strong><strong>like</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lacks </strong><strong>words</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong>graphs</strong><strong> </strong><strong>which</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>obvious</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Feel free </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>add</strong><strong> </strong><strong>some</strong><strong> </strong><strong>more</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> </strong><strong>just</strong><strong> </strong><strong>them</strong><strong> </strong><strong>so</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> </strong><strong>could</strong><strong> </strong><strong>create</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong>graphs</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Luck</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            10. persuasive speech about cyber bullying </h2><br />
                        <p>I would start with some examples of individuals destroyed, driven to suicide by cyber bullying. Go straight into it; “Sally was an honors student in medicine, highly praised for her intellect and loved by her friends and family. Great things were expected of her. She might one day cure cancer… But she never will. She is dead. Cyber bullying killed her…”
</p><p>
</p><p>Don’t drag them on too long, because the idea is to pepper the audience with quick examples so they understand the issue is not with what happened to one or a few people, but that this is endemic and happens frequently. List three or four such examples, citing something that personalizes the individual to create empathy (similar to what I wrote above), the sort of attacks they were subject to using adjectives for accent, and finally the horror that resulted.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then mention statistics to show how these are not isolated incidents. Use voice inflection and dramatic pauses for emphases.
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally delve into a personal story of how it has affected you or someone close to you. This need not and likely should not be one of suicide (unless someone close to you ‘has’ been pushed that far). The emphases in this should be the emotional pain. Do what you need to do for the audience to fully appreciate the depth of it. Belabor the lasting effect this has had on you and/or your friends.
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point, your audience should be primed to hear whatever you have to say about how to address the problem. They may not agree with your proposed solutions, but they almost certainly will agree with the need that it be addressed.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer: Cyberbullying can affect a person's mental health. It is because it could make the person's confidence go down. It can also may lead to suicide which is very dangerous.</p><p></p><br />

The sad fact is, some youths are so deeply affected by the negative influence of bullying that they have taken their own lives.

                                     Cyber-bullying has been a problem for a very long time. Due to the development of our technology today, cyber-bullying has become one of the most difficult issues to resolve in our society. Since cyber-bullying issues are more likely to happen at schools, social networking, and mobile phones; Teachers, principals, and parents are responsible to monitor, prevent, and punish cyber-bullying. The expectations of most parents of the school, is protection. Meanwhile, many staff feel unprepared and unwilling to be prosecutors and judges because they do not want to be sued for something done which might seem right to them but not to others, especially to parents who are responsible for the child's well being.<br />             Students and teachers should always have conversations about relationships on a daily basis. Although teachers can't preach kindness to students; but they can teach students how to be nice and kind to one another. Teachers needs to structure learning activities in which children can learn to view individual differences as unique sources of strength. For example, a lawsuit was filed against a high school about bullying in upstate New York; a gay teenager sued the Mohawk Central School District, saying school officials had not protected him. "The district said it would increase staff training to prevent harassment" (Eckholm and Katie 3). It is very important that every student, not just the few that sign up for special projects or after school activities, but students who are involved in any various activities in school should attend meetings about teaching students how to respect each other. This will help teachers prevent cyber-bullying in school by drawing students together. People have to understand that some children bully because they have emotional and developmental problems, or because they come from abusive families. <br />

                            22. Essay about cause and effect about cyber bullying</h2><br />
                        <strong></strong>Most people know that bullying is wrong. Calling someone names has absolutely no beneficial purpose. Moreover, hitting someone makes a bully feel good in the moment while doing permanent damage to the person being victimized. With the Internet, people now have even more opportunities to bully through cyberbullying. This includes sending crude pictures, posting fake web pages, or tweeting slanderous messages. Cyberbullying has subsequently led to a rise in a completely new kind of bullying.<p>One of the effects of bullying is that it can change the victim’s personality. It can cause people who are normally confident and happy to become self-conscious, shy, and unsure. Additionally, victims of bullying may also become sad or depressed. Their confidence might completely disappear, keeping them from trying new things or trusting people. Once a person has been bullied, they may hesitate to participate in situations where he or she might be ridiculed, such as in public speaking or in sports. A bullying victim might even begin to possess previously absent anxious<br />behavior.</p><p>Despite all the negative effects of bullying, there are even far more serious consequences. People who have been bullied sometimes become so upset, scared, or depressed that they see no worth in themselves and no way out of their torment. There have been countless reports over the past few years of students committing suicide because they were bullied. Meanwhile, there are times when victims see no recourse but to seek revenge by serious acts of violence against the bully and instigators. As a result of bullying, people can lose their ability to love and trust, denying them the chance to experience a quality relationship later in their life. They might find themselves as a submissive partner or they may want to be completely alone. Compounding all of these problems, victims often develop eating disorders, begin to self-injure, or require extensive counseling. Social bullying can also leave people without a supportive group of friends that they can lean on and spend time with.</p><p>Another unfortunate consequence of this is that bullying is often cyclical. People who have been bullied can, in an attempt to gain their power and self-esteem back, become bullies themselves. In relation to this, bullies who are not confronted or stopped may find themselves in future positions where they can bully as adults. This is where manipulative bosses and child abusers come from.</p><p>Aside from its long-term effects, some consequences of bullying can be seen and felt immediately. When one child calls another child names, the victim might cry and a bruise might appear after a punch to the arm. However, some effects of bullying are not always obvious to the naked eye. The results of bullying might grow and appear over time, damaging a person in profound ways for the long term. There are so many effects of bullying that they are impossible to count or predict. This is why it is so important to stop bullying.</p><br />

Violence has been in this world for centuries now and for the same causes, to gain power of authority. Kids in schools feel superior to others by calling other kids horrible names and making fun of them. Men hit women so they can “earn” their respect back. The point is that violence won’t make you a better person, it will make you a monster and nobody likes a monster.<br /><br /><br />

                        Bullying is a very popular disease among the school students today. Bullies may be specified as endangered species who make ridicule of others for their own fun. Although life is a journey and a tough fight, but, not everyone’s a fighter. Students with money power try to harm other students and cease their dignity and innocence for the entire school life. To discuss this current topic, I have divided my sample paper into 3 sections specifying the practice of bullying and how we can prevent it and save the children from facing this annoyance. Bullying means to intimidate other students (in school or college context) to do what one wants. Typically, Bullying is similar to ragging whereby group of people with high profile or superiority or seniority do pillory or scoff at the benign students. One should never do a wrong thing to make friends. Just for the sake of impressing other classmates, one should not attempt anything wrong that may harm a credulous student in anyway.<br />
