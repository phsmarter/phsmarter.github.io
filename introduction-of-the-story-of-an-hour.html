                                            Basketball is one of the sports that Joreen loves. He plays basketball every afternoon in a small space in the neighborhood with a ring made from shanty materials. He always finishes his chores before 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon because he does not want to be absent in any of the basketball games with his friends. One day, when they were playing with his friends, it rain suddenly that stopped their game. He ran fast towards their house but still caught up by the rain and went home wet. He thought it will stop after an hour but it did not, instead, it rained the whole night. As Joreen was staying at home, he felt something not good. He felt feverish and was worried. His mother gave him medicine and let him rest. The next morning, his mother did not allow him to go out though the sun came out already. He was sad because he knew he could not go out and play. Joreen listened to her mother. He rested well and ate nutritious foods for him to be better. He even stopped drinking soft drinks, instead, drank water. Three days after, he ran to the basketball court happily as his friends welcomed him. He was very happy playing with his friends again. He keeps on playing basketball because his dream is to be part of his most liked team in the NBA, the Miami Heat. Introduction plot from the story.

Case Study
You are the head of a large department and several supervisors report to you.
Recently you were confronted with a knotty problem. It seems that one of the supervisors
had gotten into a loud and disagreeable argument with an employee. You called the
supervisor to your office to hear his story.
The supervisor admitted losing his temper and shouting at the employee, but he
believed it was justified. He had been observing the employee over the year the man had
been with the company. During this period the employee had been frequently late, and his
absentee rate was above average. In addition, the supervisor went on to say that the
employee was a socializer on the job, frequently leaving his work to talk to other
employees and to use the telephone for personal calls. The supervisor then said that the
proverbial last straw caused his outburst. The employee had come in late, and after about
an hour of work he made a telephone call which the supervisor had timed as lasting 14
minutes. The supervisor then started his tirade. The employee denied being on the
telephone that long, the supervisor called him a liar, and they continued the vituperative
exchange which ended when you called the supervisor to your office.
After listening to the supervisor, you asked him if he had disciplined the employee
before, since apparently he had a poor record. You also asked if the employee had been
placed on probation or had been warned. The supervisor looked at you sheepishly and
seemed reluctant to answer. You pressed him, for an answer, and he finally blurted out that
he was afraid to discipline the employee because he was black. He stated that the
impression he had from you and higher management was that black employees should be
given special treatment so that they would feel welcome and not discriminated against. He
felt the company wanted to impress the public with its forward-looking employment
practices and didn't want any trouble with the black community. As a result, he was lax in
discipline and had kept a hands-off approach with all black employees until his outburst.
He said he couldn't stand it anymore, and the 14-mintue telephone call caused him to lose
his temper.

Assessment Directions: Read the selection carefully using different types of reading approach and write a close analysis and interpretation in the short story entitled “Stories of Nature from Japan” by Nitin Das. Write your answer in a separate sheet of paper. Title: Author: Introduction: Body: Conclusion: My Opinion:Stories of Nature from Japanby Nitin DasAt the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan was a dense forest that was home to many animals. A group of samurai warriors passing by decided to cut down the forest and make place for a training ground for martial arts. But a monk who lived in a secluded monastery nearby objected. Since the Samurai could not fight the monk, they decided on a simple competition to end the argument. The Samurai and the monk would race to the top of Mt. Fuji and the person who lost would have to leave.The samurai chose their fittest soldier and next morning both the monk and the soldier set off from the base of Mt Fuji to reach its summit. The samurai being young and energetic quickly took the lead. For a while the going was easy, but soon he found his path blocked by thick forests that cut into his flesh when he tried to pass. But the Samurai used his sword and cut his way up. He climbed hurriedly but his path was blocked by steep rocks. The samurai shed his heavy armour and sword and began to climb. He climbed for hours even though the way kept getting tougher. Soon he found himself hanging from a precipice with no way to go further. Many hours passed and by the next morning the Samurai’s strength was completely drained. He was about to let go of his hold and fall down to his death, when a hand reached out from above and pulled the Samurai up. The grateful Samurai was surprised to see that it was the monk who had saved his life. The Samurai was ashamed and he asked the monk how he had managed to climb up so fast. The monk explained that when you climb a mountain, you don’t make your own path, but you let the mountain show you the path.Moral: We need to learn to make our way around Nature, not against Nature​</a>

                                            ASSESSMENTThe Sob Sister’s Story The dead girl, beautiful and peaceful in death, her scarlet lips slightly parted as though whispering a caress to her lover, her blue eyes gentle and unquestioning as a baby’s, lay in the murderer’s arms like a child who has been rocked to sleep. Her golden hair falling in profusion about her shoulder all but concealed the cruel welt of red about her throat. The murderer, clutching is still burden to him, like a mother holding an infant, appeared dazed. As the police came in, he rose to meet them, still carrying his precious burden in his arms. The officers had almost to force him to relinquish her. He could not answer questions- could merely clutch the closer to his breast all that remained of the girl he loved better than life, and mutter, “ I love her, I love her,” like a man in a dream. A few hours later when I saw him in the sordid surroundings of the 10th Precinct Station House, so different from the cozy cottage which had been the abode of a tragic love, he was still dry-eyed, though his face wore a ghastly pallor. But when tried to question him, I became aware of terrific strain under which he suffered, and he showed all signs of a man on the verge of hysteria. When I tried to draw from him the motive for the pitiful tragedy, he could only rely, his pale boyish face like a mask: “I killed her, but God didn’t say a word, a word.” At last he managed pitifully to say: “I killed her so that she would be mine alone for always!” And this is the irony of fate! The very greatness of his love made him strangle her. Separated as they were wealth, social position, and all that implies, it was only in death that they could be united.

Case Study
You are the head of a large department and several supervisors report to you.
Recently you were confronted with a knotty problem. It seems that one of the supervisors
had gotten into a loud and disagreeable argument with an employee. You called the
supervisor to your office to hear his story.
The supervisor admitted losing his temper and shouting at the employee, but he
believed it was justified. He had been observing the employee over the year the man had
been with the company. During this period the employee had been frequently late, and his
absentee rate was above average. In addition, the supervisor went on to say that the
employee was a socializer on the job, frequently leaving his work to talk to other
employees and to use the telephone for personal calls. The supervisor then said that the
proverbial last straw caused his outburst. The employee had come in late, and after about
an hour of work he made a telephone call which the supervisor had timed as lasting 14
minutes. The supervisor then started his tirade. The employee denied being on the
telephone that long, the supervisor called him a liar, and they continued the vituperative
exchange which ended when you called the supervisor to your office.
After listening to the supervisor, you asked him if he had disciplined the employee
before, since apparently he had a poor record. You also asked if the employee had been
placed on probation or had been warned. The supervisor looked at you sheepishly and
seemed reluctant to answer. You pressed him, for an answer, and he finally blurted out that
he was afraid to discipline the employee because he was black. He stated that the
impression he had from you and higher management was that black employees should be
given special treatment so that they would feel welcome and not discriminated against. He
felt the company wanted to impress the public with its forward-looking employment
practices and didn't want any trouble with the black community. As a result, he was lax in
discipline and had kept a hands-off approach with all black employees until his outburst.
He said he couldn't stand it anymore, and the 14-mintue telephone call caused him to lose
his temper.

Her golden hair falling in profusion about her shoulder all but concealed the cruel welt of red about her throat. The murderer, clutching is still burden to him, like a mother holding an infant, appeared dazed. As the police came in, he rose to meet them, still carrying his precious burden in his arms. The officers had almost to force him to relinquish her. He could not answer questions- could merely clutch the closer to his breast all that remained of the girl he loved better than life, and mutter, “ I love her, I love her,” like a man in a dream.

But when tried to question him, I became aware of terrific strain under which he suffered, and he showed all signs of a man on the verge of hysteria. When I tried to draw from him the motive for the pitiful tragedy, he could only rely, his pale boyish face like a mask: “I killed her, but God didn’t say a word, a word.” At last he managed pitifully to say: “I killed her so that she would be mine alone for always!” And this is the irony of fate! The very greatness of his love made him strangle her. Separated as they were wealth, social position, and all that implies, it was only in death that they could be united. Who are we to pass judgment on such love? Complete the outline based on “The Sob Sister’s Story” selection. I. Setting A. Time :B. Place :II. Character C. Protagonist :D. Antagonist :III. PlotF.
