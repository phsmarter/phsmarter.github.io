                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

 Africa My Africa
 by Davip Diop
Africa my Africa
Africa of proud warriors in ancestral Savannahs
Africa of whom my grandmother sings
On the banks of the distant river
I have never known you
But your blood flows in my veins
Your beautiful black blood that irrigates the fields
The blood of your sweat
The sweat of your work
The work of your slaveryAfrica, tell me Africa
Is this your back that is unbent.
This back that never breaks under the weight of
humiliation
This back trembling with red scars
And saying no to the whip under the midday
sun?
But a grave voice answers me
Impetuous child that tree, young and strong
That tree over there
Splendidly alone amidst white and faded flowers
That is your Africa springing up anew
springing up patiently, obstinately
Whose fruit bit by bit acquires
The bitter taste of liberty.

                                            11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like a bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.” The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way.

to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it

The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to

                        <p>Nature is a work of art that is constantly evolving and changing, and its beauty is unparalleled. From the majestic mountains to the vast oceans and from the intricate patterns of a butterfly's wings to the magnificent colors of a sunset, nature has a beauty that is both mesmerizing and humbling. As a moralist, I believe that this beauty carries with it important moral lessons and values that we can learn from.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, the beauty of nature teaches us the importance of humility. As humans, we often have a tendency to believe that we are the center of the universe, and that everything revolves around us. However, when we immerse ourselves in the beauty of nature, we are reminded of just how small we are in comparison to the vastness of the natural world. This realization can be humbling and can teach us to be more respectful of the environment and the creatures that inhabit it.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the beauty of nature teaches us the importance of perseverance. Nature is a constant reminder that even in the face of adversity, life goes on. From the delicate flowers that bloom in the cracks of concrete to the towering trees that withstand harsh winds and storms, nature teaches us that resilience and determination are essential traits for survival.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the beauty of nature teaches us the importance of balance. The natural world is a delicate balance of ecosystems and cycles that work together to create a sustainable environment. When we disrupt this balance through pollution, deforestation, and other harmful practices, we threaten the very beauty that we seek to admire. Therefore, we must learn to respect and preserve the natural world so that future generations can also appreciate its beauty.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the beauty of nature is not just a sight to behold, but it also carries with it important moral lessons and values that we can learn from. As a moralist, I believe that we must strive to respect and preserve the natural world so that we can continue to learn from its beauty for generations to come.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nature is the most divine creation of god around us, it is considered an integral part of mankind. Nature has bestowed us with water, air, plants and much more to make us survive on this planet. But are we paying back to our mother nature? The answer is no as we have not only failed in paying back but also exploited nature to a great extent.</p><p></p><p>Nature provides beauty all around, it’s the nature that makes the surroundings attractive and worthy to live in. Human life is possible because of nature and its various boons. Mother nature is a gift of God and must be respected just like we respect and love our mothers.</p><p></p><p>Nature is a unique blessing to us, everything created by God on this earth has some purpose and order in life. The radiant rivers, the shining valleys, huge mountains, blue oceans, white sky, the sun, the rain, the moon and the list is non-ending. All these things have some order and serve a purpose in life. Despite all this, we are still doing activities that are not only harmful but can cause real devastation to nature all around. </p><p></p><p>There are numerous creatures on this planet and every single creature serves a defined purpose in the ecosystem. Humans, on the other hand, are trying to disturb this ecosystem by entering into the places and things they are not supposed to enter. They are creating an imbalance in the ecological cycle of the environment and thus creating havoc all around.</p><p></p><p>Everything we do is dependent on nature. In fact, our life is possible because of this beautiful nature. We depend on water, air, fire for our survival and then again we are exploiting the same things we completely rely on.</p><br />

                        Beauty in Nature<p>Our senses, which are the doors that open to the inner world, are profoundly affected by the <strong>beauty of the natural world</strong>, and this impact can range from feelings of awe, wonder, or amazement to the inability to believe that it really exists.  </p><p></p><p>When we consider the <strong>beauty of nature</strong>, the things that dazzle the senses come to mind, such as the prominence of a mountain, the size of the sea, or the growth of a flower's life.  Simply appreciating beautiful objects can often make us joyful, and this emotional or affective response on our part seems to be crucial to how we perceive beauty. </p><p></p><p>The majority of the time, it seems to me, the reason we find these things to be beautiful is not because of something else they might bring us, like a piece of furniture or a "delicacy" to be consumed, but rather because of the way that the forms of these things immediately hit us upon sight.

                            4. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent. Giving respect to others is a way of exercising and multiplying our quality of respect, which will inevitably earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, giving respect to all individuals is crucial, and it is an innate quality that we possess. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others, and it helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others. By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

 Africa My Africa
 by Davip Diop
Africa my Africa
Africa of proud warriors in ancestral Savannahs
Africa of whom my grandmother sings
On the banks of the distant river
I have never known you
But your blood flows in my veins
Your beautiful black blood that irrigates the fields
The blood of your sweat
The sweat of your work
The work of your slaveryAfrica, tell me Africa
Is this your back that is unbent.
This back that never breaks under the weight of
humiliation
This back trembling with red scars
And saying no to the whip under the midday
sun?
But a grave voice answers me
Impetuous child that tree, young and strong
That tree over there
Splendidly alone amidst white and faded flowers
That is your Africa springing up anew
springing up patiently, obstinately
Whose fruit bit by bit acquires
The bitter taste of liberty.

Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like a bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>This thesis statement is not debatable. First, the word pollution implies that something is bad or negative in some way. Furthermore, all studies agree that pollution is a problem; they simply disagree on the impact it will have or the scope of the problem. No one could reasonably argue that pollution is unambiguously good.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Example of a debatable thesis statement:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>At least 25 percent of the federal budget should be spent on limiting pollution.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>This is an example of a debatable thesis because reasonable people could disagree with it. Some people might think that this is how we should spend the nation's money. Others might feel that we should be spending more money on education. Still others could argue that corporations, not the government, should be paying to limit pollution.</strong></p><br />
