Examples of light physical activityinclude walking slowly, playing pool (billiards), croquet, fishing, and light housework such ascooking, dusting, ironing, folding laundry, washing dishes, and putting away groceries. Thestudy found that replacing 30 minutes a day of sitting time with light activity was linked with alonger life expectancy. More intense activity was linked with even greater health benefits. Thestudy was published March 25, 2019 in American Journal of Preventive Medicine.Lots of research links physical activity with a lower risk of certain cancers, heart disease,and death. Research also shows that long hours spent sitting, no matter how much exerciseyou get otherwise, is linked with a higher risk of disease and death. That prompted the AmericanCancer Society to study the effect of replacing sitting time with light levels of activity, and withmoderate-to-vigorous levels of activity. Examples of moderate activity include brisk walking anddancing. Vigorous activity includes jogging, running, and soccer.The study included almost 38,000 men and almost 55,000 women in the Cancer PreventionStudy-Il Nutrition Cohort from 1999 - 2014.Among those who got 17 minutes a day or less of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity- the least active group -- replacing 30 minutes of sitting a day with light physical activity was-linked with a 14% lowered risk of dying during the study period. Replacing sitting with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was linked with a 45% lower risk of dying. For the most activegroup, those who got more than 38 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,the researchers did not see a benefit.The authors conclude that replacing small amounts of sitting time with even lightphysical activity may help less active adults live longer, including older adults. ErikaRees Punia, PhD, lead author of the study and Post-Doctoral Fellow at the American CancerSociety, suggests less active adults should include more light activities during their leisure timeas well as working it into their work and home routines.​</a>

___________1. An experimental study that is conducted in the field, laboratory or classroom would reveal a cause and effect
relationship among the variables.
___________2. Research design is a plan for collecting and utilizing data so that desired and sufficient information are obtained and
the hypotheses are tested properly.
___________3. Case study uses data documents, relics and oral testimony which serve as example of primary sources. While
secondary sources used are second hand information.
___________4. When the researcher wishes to conduct a study on the evaluation of an implementation of the work-oriented curriculum at the fishery schools in the province of Sulu, he
is using the correlational survey research.
___________5. The purpose of descriptive design is to find new truth that may have different forms such as increased quantity of knowledge, an increased insight into factors which are operating, the discovery of a new causal relationship, and
more accurate formulation of the problem.
___________6. In pre-test and post experimental group, the control group is the group that receives the intervention that will create
an effect or change on the study.
___________7. Case study design is an intensive investigation of a particular individual, institution, community, or any group considered as a unit which includes the developmental, adjustment, remedial, or corrective procedures that suitable
        11
follow diagnosis of the causes of maladjustment or of favorable development.
___________8. Descriptive Design is a systematic and critical inquiry about the past events using the critical method in understanding and interpreting of facts which are
applicable to current issues.
___________9. Longitudinal survey involves much time allotted for investigation of the same subjects at two or more points in time. It collects information at different points in time in
order to study changes over time.

                            5. What is itTpluActivity 3: This must be newProcedure: Read the paragraph and make markings on the important things discussedA new study from researchers at the American Cancer Society finds that even lightlevels of physical activity are healthier than just sitting. Examples of light physical activityinclude walking slowly, playing pool (billiards), croquet, fishing, and light housework such ascooking, dusting, ironing, folding laundry, washing dishes, and putting away groceries. Thestudy found that replacing 30 minutes a day of sitting time with light activity was linked with alonger life expectancy. More intense activity was linked with even greater health benefits. Thestudy was published March 25, 2019 in American Journal of Preventive Medicine.Lots of research links physical activity with a lower risk of certain cancers, heart disease,and death. Research also shows that long hours spent sitting, no matter how much exerciseyou get otherwise, is linked with a higher risk of disease and death. That prompted the AmericanCancer Society to study the effect of replacing sitting time with light levels of activity, and withmoderate-to-vigorous levels of activity. Examples of moderate activity include brisk walking anddancing. Vigorous activity includes jogging, running, and soccer.The study included almost 38,000 men and almost 55,000 women in the Cancer PreventionStudy-Il Nutrition Cohort from 1999 - 2014.Among those who got 17 minutes a day or less of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity- the least active group -- replacing 30 minutes of sitting a day with light physical activity was-linked with a 14% lowered risk of dying during the study period. Replacing sitting with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was linked with a 45% lower risk of dying. For the most activegroup, those who got more than 38 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,the researchers did not see a benefit.The authors conclude that replacing small amounts of sitting time with even lightphysical activity may help less active adults live longer, including older adults. ErikaRees Punia, PhD, lead author of the study and Post-Doctoral Fellow at the American CancerSociety, suggests less active adults should include more light activities during their leisure timeas well as working it into their work and home routines.​</h2><br />

                            28. Learning Task 1: True or False
Directions: Read the statements below then write True if the statement contains facts pertaining to Research variables and Designs and False if the underlined word or statement is wrong or if the statement contains an error.
___________1. An experimental study that is conducted in the field, laboratory or classroom would reveal a cause and effect
relationship among the variables.
___________2. Research design is a plan for collecting and utilizing data so that desired and sufficient information are obtained and
the hypotheses are tested properly.
___________3. Case study uses data documents, relics and oral testimony which serve as example of primary sources. While
secondary sources used are second hand information.
___________4. When the researcher wishes to conduct a study on the evaluation of an implementation of the work-oriented curriculum at the fishery schools in the province of Sulu, he
is using the correlational survey research.
___________5. The purpose of descriptive design is to find new truth that may have different forms such as increased quantity of knowledge, an increased insight into factors which are operating, the discovery of a new causal relationship, and
more accurate formulation of the problem.
___________6. In pre-test and post experimental group, the control group is the group that receives the intervention that will create
an effect or change on the study.
___________7. Case study design is an intensive investigation of a particular individual, institution, community, or any group considered as a unit which includes the developmental, adjustment, remedial, or corrective procedures that suitable
        11
follow diagnosis of the causes of maladjustment or of favorable development.
___________8. Descriptive Design is a systematic and critical inquiry about the past events using the critical method in understanding and interpreting of facts which are
applicable to current issues.
___________9. Longitudinal survey involves much time allotted for investigation of the same subjects at two or more points in time. It collects information at different points in time in
order to study changes over time.
___________10. A variable is any factor or property that a researchermeasures, controls, and/or manipulates.</h2><br />
