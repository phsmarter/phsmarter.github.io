To organize lines of communication</strong> is the purpose of the organizational structure. A hierarchical organizational structure can clarify the flow of communication from all positions by providing clarity to whom everyone should speak to if there is something to be communicated.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. To formalize authority</strong> is the the purpose of the organization. Each position in the organizational structure is made to clarify the authority of each position so that there is no abuse of authority.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. To limit workers' rights is not</strong> one of the purpose of the organizational structure. The rights of all workers should always be the same regardless of their position. Examples are the right to receive a salary, the right to receive equal treatment, and others.</p><p></p><p>Other than the three purposes above, there are more purposes for organizational structure</p><strong>To divide tasks evenly and clearly</strong><p>The existence of an organizational structure allows each position to get tasks according to their abilities and capacities</p><p></p><strong>To minimize conflict. </strong><p>With an organizational structure that divides the tasks of each position, conflicts in the organization can be reduced because everyone will focus on their tasks.</p><p></p><strong>To provide clarity of responsibilities</strong><p>With the organizational structure, each position will get its own responsibilities.
