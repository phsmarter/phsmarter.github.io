                                            Summarize the following article in not more than 120 words
The childhood years are supposed to be the best times of one's life; playing and having fun. Yet there are many children who are deprived of this childhood. They are tortured and verbally and physically abused. There is no reason or excuse for child abuse. Abusers claim they do it because of the stress of work. Child-abusing housewives way they feel harassed by a crying child and are unable to curb their own fury, especially if no support is received from anyone. This is not surprising since support is extended to a victim of child abuse more readily than to the perpetrator. Occasionally, parents may vent their frustrations on their child if they fight and quarrel with each other. In cases like there, it is the children who are the victims.
In this modern age where both parents are usually holding jobs, children are left with babysitters and nurseries. Abuse by these carers may occur when there are too many children to be minded. The disappearance of the extended family system is partly to be blamed for these incidents.. Crowded homes and financial problems can also lead to child abuse. When there are too many mouths to feed,
parents feel the pressure and prevent their anger on a child. Substance abuse is another factor which increases the incidents of child abuse. Under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a parent many not know what he or she may be doing. Or, rather, knows what he or she is doing but is not bothered at all. A drug addict many experience mood swings and is easily provoked by a crying baby. Thus we see and read horrifying reports of a child being savagely tortured and dumped elsewhere, like garbage.
Psychologists believe that child abusers may have been victims of abuse themselves. Thus, in anger and hatred, they repeat the vicious cycle of abuse. Some have no love for the children they abuse. Some have been brought up to believe that children should be beaten in order to maintain control. These are troubled people who need help.
A home is supposed to be a haven where a child ought to feel safe and secure. Unfortunately, more often than not, the home is also where a child is abused. Whatever the reasons for the abuse, something must be done to stop the cruelty and help these parents who simply cannot cope with parenting. Parents-to-be should be counseled and inculcated with parenting skills. The Child Protection Act which was passed in Parliament in 1991 does not effectively prevent child abuse. Stricter enforcement is necessary. Thus. It requires a commitment from each individual to help families with victims, and troubled parents, the perpetrators.</a>

                                            over use it, 2. Read "Should Homework be Mandatory?" and answer the questions below. Should Homework be Mandatory? I can almost see many students nodding along with me as I ask this question. Younger generations overloaded with home tasks and numerous assignments have already raised this issue many times. Yet, homework remains mandatory, Is it fair or should it be canceled? I believe that homework should not be viewed as a mandatory part of education for several reasons. First, children spend seven hours every single workday at school. That is a huge chunk of life, and with homework added on top of these hours, a child is left with no time to live his life to the fullest, socialize, or grow in other areas. Second, sitting at your desk solving problems does no good to your health. Kids need time to get outside and have some fun, join a football league, or ride their bikes with friends around the block. Otherwise, children will be very smart but surprisingly weak physically. Another argument against this position is that homework is not always the best way to obtain knowledge quality-wise. Students tend to ask their parents or siblings for help whenever facing difficulties. Busy parents not always willing to spend extra time explaining school material to their little one solves the problems themselves aiming to have more time for family, not lessons. As a result, the child will have the homework done. But that's not his work. So, the whole idea of dedicating time to self-education is lost here. Finally, knowing that after classes you would still have to work at home makes a kid less concentrated at school. This results in short attention spans and difficulty to concentrate on something for too long. All in all, homework should rather be an option. Students understanding that they are left behind in some subjects will take their time to go over the material at home. However, in other cases, they should have time after school for other activities. What is the position paper about? . If you were the writer, what will be your stand? Defend your answer.

                                            Study Habits play a significant part in the academic life of every student. It is one of the ingredients thatcompletes to the overall success of the child in school. A good study habit in the formative years of the child couldbe carried on by the child throughout his life. That is why, the formation of the best study habit early is veryimportant to know especially among parents and teachers.Without study habit, a person may not grow and become self-limiting in life. Many areas of our life require ahabitual act of doing things. As the adage goes "Your habit becomes your destiny", a life worth living for is a productof an everyday choices that we make.According to Robinson (2000) the keys to better learning and better academic performance in schools aregood teachers, good study environment, the course of study, parents' cooperation, high quality books and, the mostimportant, the study habits. Investigating the nature of study habits is important because factors related to studyingsuch as motivation and specific study techniques have been linked to academic success.Many students fail not because they lack ability, but because they do not have adequate study skills (Menzel1982). Study habit is the tendency of a student to learn in a systematic and efficient way, when opportunity is given.It is also defined as the devotion of time and attention to acquire information or knowledge especially from booksor in other words, it's the pursuit of academic knowledge by a detailed investigation of a subject or situation (OxfordDictionary &amp; Thesaurus of English Language, 2003).Thus, in order to improve academic performance of students, it seems essential to improve their study habitswithout which desired outcomes cannot be achieved. Development of good study habits in children depends uponthe combined efforts of parents and teachers (Kizlik, 2001).Robinson (2000) found that certain bad study habits result in poor academic performance, whereas certaingood study habits result in high academic performance. Creemers and Reynold (2000), on the basis of data of theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, demonstrated a positive relationship between good study habits andacademic performance of 8th and 9th Grade students.Although there is a substantial amount of research available on the study habits and academic performancethere is no available research on this topic in Dumaran Central School. Other researchers have also pointed towardsa positive relationship between study habits and academic performance (Fatima, 1967; Siddique, 1989). Studies inPakistan have revealed the relationship of academic performance with intelligence and emotional intelligence(Shujja, 2008; Khalid &amp; Ahmad, 2009).These various studies related to the study habit and academic performance of the students lead to theformulation of this research topic. The aimed of this study is to find out the study habits of pupils in Dumaran CentralSchool and how it affects to their academic performance.Answer the following:1. What was the excerpt all about?2.

_______2. Conducting face-to-face classes at this time when there is no vaccine for school age children is too risky. This is supported by Pres. Rodrigo Duterte when he said. "Until the COVID-19 vaccine is available, I will not allow the traditional face-to-face teaching or learning." He further added that "Life that is lost is lost forever. Education that is delayed can be recovered.
_______3. The universe is a complex system like a watch, Wo would not think that a watch can come about by accident. Something to complicated must have been created by someone. The universe is a lot more complicated, so it must have been created by a being who is a lot more intelligent.
_______4. The restaurant next to our school is a good place to go to have a good meal. My friends and I went there once, and we experienced the best service. The staff were all very polite and accommodating. The food is good with a reasonable price.
_______5. I know someone who smoked for decades, and it never produced any significant illness. Those claims about smoking are exaggerated!

                                            Summary of                                                Close knit family I don't view my important characteristics as different from those my family has imparted on me throughout the years. The pride, care, dedication, effort, and hard-working attitude that I view as critical to any success I may achieve have all descended upon me courtesy of my close-knit, Italian family. Born the child of two immigrants who came here with nothing, only one possessing a college degree, the importance of a good work ethic was stressed by my parents from day one. Through their actions in their jobs and through the verbal lessons on life I began to get from the moment I could communicate, they set an example for me to follow, one of being proud of what I do, no matter what it was, and above all, to care about everything I do as if everything had a big impact. This meant that everything had to be done right and be done well. Undoubtedly, following their own advice carried my parents from their status as blue-collar immigrants who labored as factory workers to white-collar citizens, one of whom owns his own business while the other works as a bank officer. Those ascensions from nothing only served as other examples for me to follow, examples that delineated the ability for a person to improve through effort. Another quotation from my father propelled me from the time I started school to today: "No matter what you do, you have to be the best." This set up the inner drive that motivates all my actions. It was what forced me to try hard in school although I didn't know English well enough to always understand the teacher. It's the reason why I have developed my skills. It accounts for my dedication to all activities, and to the hard work I put into all of them as I strive to lead both in class and out. Essentially, my parentage was the first quality that distinguished me as a leader. Despite all the talk of being a leader, I have never lost sight of the importance of my family. I know I owe my family everything, and as a result, I'll always be close with it.​</a>

                                            11. Kidnapping and Abduction. Kidnapping is taking away or forcefully moving a person against his/her will and holding him/her in unjust captivity. The act is usually done for a motive like getting a monetary reward/hansom or getting some sort of benefit from the person or their family. The kidnapper is usually a family acquaintance who knows about the family's wealth and influence, or a stranger who targeted the victim based on their outward appearance of wealth or information given to the kidnapper from someone who knows the victim intimately, such as a household employee or someone else who suspects that the victim has lot of cash. On the other hand, abduction is the use of deceit or force in order to take a person or a child away from their home or relatives. In abduction, the victim usually knows or has some sort of relation with the abductor. Most of the time, the abductor is not holding the victim for profit or any monetary gain. Abduction usually happens to children with separated parents, wherein the child will be tricked by one parent to come with him/her and take the child away from the other parent who has sole custody of the child. This is usually because of an emotional disorder created when the abductor feels that the child's welfare and best interests are at risk or that the child question1: what did you feel after reading the poem? why?2: could this really have happened? why?3: if you were the writer, how would you end the story? 4: what would you do if you wre the following and why?a.the motherb.sashac.leighd.a concerned neighbor​</a>

                                            Should Homework be Mandatory? I can almost see many students nodding along with me as I ask this question. Younger generations overloaded with home tasks and numerous assignments have already raised this issue many times.  Yet, homework remains mandatory. Is it fair or should it be cancelled?  I believe that homework should not be viewed as a mandatory part of education for several reasons.  First, children spend seven hours every single workday at school. That is a huge chunk of life, and with homework added on top of these hours, a child is left with no time to live his life to the fullest, socialize, or grow in other areas. Second, sitting at your desk solving problems does no good to your health. Kids need time to get outside and have some fun, join a football league, or ride their bikes with friends around the block. Otherwise, children will be very smart but  surprisingly weak physically. Another argument against this position is that homework is not always the best way to obtain knowledge quality-wise. Students tend to ask their parents or siblings for help whenever facing difficulties. Busy parents not always willing to spend extra time explaining school material to their little one solve the problems themselves aiming to have more time for family, not lessons. As a result, the child will have the homework done. But that’s really not his work. So, the whole idea of dedicating time to self- education is lost here.  Finally, knowing that after classes you would still have to work at home makes a kid less concentrated at school. This results in short attention spans and difficulty to concentrate on something for too long.  All in all, homework should rather be an option. Students understanding that they areleft behind at some subjects will take their time to go over the material at home. However, in other cases, they should have time after school for other activities.

                            3. Summarize the following article in not more than 120 words
The childhood years are supposed to be the best times of one's life; playing and having fun. Yet there are many children who are deprived of this childhood. They are tortured and verbally and physically abused. There is no reason or excuse for child abuse. Abusers claim they do it because of the stress of work. Child-abusing housewives way they feel harassed by a crying child and are unable to curb their own fury, especially if no support is received from anyone. This is not surprising since support is extended to a victim of child abuse more readily than to the perpetrator. Occasionally, parents may vent their frustrations on their child if they fight and quarrel with each other. In cases like there, it is the children who are the victims.
In this modern age where both parents are usually holding jobs, children are left with babysitters and nurseries. Abuse by these carers may occur when there are too many children to be minded. The disappearance of the extended family system is partly to be blamed for these incidents.. Crowded homes and financial problems can also lead to child abuse. When there are too many mouths to feed,
parents feel the pressure and prevent their anger on a child. Substance abuse is another factor which increases the incidents of child abuse. Under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a parent many not know what he or she may be doing. Or, rather, knows what he or she is doing but is not bothered at all. A drug addict many experience mood swings and is easily provoked by a crying baby. Thus we see and read horrifying reports of a child being savagely tortured and dumped elsewhere, like garbage.
Psychologists believe that child abusers may have been victims of abuse themselves. Thus, in anger and hatred, they repeat the vicious cycle of abuse. Some have no love for the children they abuse. Some have been brought up to believe that children should be beaten in order to maintain control. These are troubled people who need help.
A home is supposed to be a haven where a child ought to feel safe and secure. Unfortunately, more often than not, the home is also where a child is abused. Whatever the reasons for the abuse, something must be done to stop the cruelty and help these parents who simply cannot cope with parenting. Parents-to-be should be counseled and inculcated with parenting skills. The Child Protection Act which was passed in Parliament in 1991 does not effectively prevent child abuse. Stricter enforcement is necessary. Thus. It requires a commitment from each individual to help families with victims, and troubled parents, the perpetrators.</h2><br />

                            5. Study Habits play a significant part in the academic life of every student. It is one of the ingredients thatcompletes to the overall success of the child in school. A good study habit in the formative years of the child couldbe carried on by the child throughout his life. That is why, the formation of the best study habit early is veryimportant to know especially among parents and teachers.Without study habit, a person may not grow and become self-limiting in life. Many areas of our life require ahabitual act of doing things. As the adage goes "Your habit becomes your destiny", a life worth living for is a productof an everyday choices that we make.According to Robinson (2000) the keys to better learning and better academic performance in schools aregood teachers, good study environment, the course of study, parents' cooperation, high quality books and, the mostimportant, the study habits. Investigating the nature of study habits is important because factors related to studyingsuch as motivation and specific study techniques have been linked to academic success.Many students fail not because they lack ability, but because they do not have adequate study skills (Menzel1982). Study habit is the tendency of a student to learn in a systematic and efficient way, when opportunity is given.It is also defined as the devotion of time and attention to acquire information or knowledge especially from booksor in other words, it's the pursuit of academic knowledge by a detailed investigation of a subject or situation (OxfordDictionary &amp; Thesaurus of English Language, 2003).Thus, in order to improve academic performance of students, it seems essential to improve their study habitswithout which desired outcomes cannot be achieved. Development of good study habits in children depends uponthe combined efforts of parents and teachers (Kizlik, 2001).Robinson (2000) found that certain bad study habits result in poor academic performance, whereas certaingood study habits result in high academic performance. Creemers and Reynold (2000), on the basis of data of theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, demonstrated a positive relationship between good study habits andacademic performance of 8th and 9th Grade students.Although there is a substantial amount of research available on the study habits and academic performancethere is no available research on this topic in Dumaran Central School. Other researchers have also pointed towardsa positive relationship between study habits and academic performance (Fatima, 1967; Siddique, 1989). Studies inPakistan have revealed the relationship of academic performance with intelligence and emotional intelligence(Shujja, 2008; Khalid &amp; Ahmad, 2009).These various studies related to the study habit and academic performance of the students lead to theformulation of this research topic. The aimed of this study is to find out the study habits of pupils in Dumaran CentralSchool and how it affects to their academic performance.Answer the following:1. What was the excerpt all about?2.

                            9. Summary of                                                Close knit family I don't view my important characteristics as different from those my family has imparted on me throughout the years. The pride, care, dedication, effort, and hard-working attitude that I view as critical to any success I may achieve have all descended upon me courtesy of my close-knit, Italian family. Born the child of two immigrants who came here with nothing, only one possessing a college degree, the importance of a good work ethic was stressed by my parents from day one. Through their actions in their jobs and through the verbal lessons on life I began to get from the moment I could communicate, they set an example for me to follow, one of being proud of what I do, no matter what it was, and above all, to care about everything I do as if everything had a big impact. This meant that everything had to be done right and be done well. Undoubtedly, following their own advice carried my parents from their status as blue-collar immigrants who labored as factory workers to white-collar citizens, one of whom owns his own business while the other works as a bank officer. Those ascensions from nothing only served as other examples for me to follow, examples that delineated the ability for a person to improve through effort. Another quotation from my father propelled me from the time I started school to today: "No matter what you do, you have to be the best." This set up the inner drive that motivates all my actions. It was what forced me to try hard in school although I didn't know English well enough to always understand the teacher. It's the reason why I have developed my skills. It accounts for my dedication to all activities, and to the hard work I put into all of them as I strive to lead both in class and out. Essentially, my parentage was the first quality that distinguished me as a leader. Despite all the talk of being a leader, I have never lost sight of the importance of my family. I know I owe my family everything, and as a result, I'll always be close with it.​</h2><br />

                            27. 11. Kidnapping and Abduction. Kidnapping is taking away or forcefully moving a person against his/her will and holding him/her in unjust captivity. The act is usually done for a motive like getting a monetary reward/hansom or getting some sort of benefit from the person or their family. The kidnapper is usually a family acquaintance who knows about the family's wealth and influence, or a stranger who targeted the victim based on their outward appearance of wealth or information given to the kidnapper from someone who knows the victim intimately, such as a household employee or someone else who suspects that the victim has lot of cash. On the other hand, abduction is the use of deceit or force in order to take a person or a child away from their home or relatives. In abduction, the victim usually knows or has some sort of relation with the abductor. Most of the time, the abductor is not holding the victim for profit or any monetary gain. Abduction usually happens to children with separated parents, wherein the child will be tricked by one parent to come with him/her and take the child away from the other parent who has sole custody of the child. This is usually because of an emotional disorder created when the abductor feels that the child's welfare and best interests are at risk or that the child question1: what did you feel after reading the poem? why?2: could this really have happened? why?3: if you were the writer, how would you end the story? 4: what would you do if you wre the following and why?a.the motherb.sashac.leighd.a concerned neighbor​</h2><br />

                            29. Should Homework be Mandatory? I can almost see many students nodding along with me as I ask this question. Younger generations overloaded with home tasks and numerous assignments have already raised this issue many times.  Yet, homework remains mandatory. Is it fair or should it be cancelled?  I believe that homework should not be viewed as a mandatory part of education for several reasons.  First, children spend seven hours every single workday at school. That is a huge chunk of life, and with homework added on top of these hours, a child is left with no time to live his life to the fullest, socialize, or grow in other areas. Second, sitting at your desk solving problems does no good to your health. Kids need time to get outside and have some fun, join a football league, or ride their bikes with friends around the block. Otherwise, children will be very smart but  surprisingly weak physically. Another argument against this position is that homework is not always the best way to obtain knowledge quality-wise. Students tend to ask their parents or siblings for help whenever facing difficulties. Busy parents not always willing to spend extra time explaining school material to their little one solve the problems themselves aiming to have more time for family, not lessons. As a result, the child will have the homework done. But that’s really not his work. So, the whole idea of dedicating time to self- education is lost here.  Finally, knowing that after classes you would still have to work at home makes a kid less concentrated at school. This results in short attention spans and difficulty to concentrate on something for too long.  All in all, homework should rather be an option. Students understanding that they areleft behind at some subjects will take their time to go over the material at home. However, in other cases, they should have time after school for other activities.
