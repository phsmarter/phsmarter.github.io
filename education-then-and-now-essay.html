                                            Teenagers are forever being told that they need a good education so that they can have the career they want, but many do not listen. However, it is important to remember that your schooling, no matter how long it may feel, lasts for just a few short years compared to the rest of your life ahead of you. Therefore, it is better to sacrifice a little bit of fun now so that you can find happiness in later life, as you will be happier if you can do a job that you enjoy and afford to do the things you want.

Essay on Education By: Priyanka Nagrale Countless words are written daily about the importance of education. Indubitably, education is the only valuable asset humans can achieve. Human evolution over eons is a result of education both formal and informal. Further, education is the sole basis on which the future of the human race depends. Our quest for knowledge is unending and will continue till planet Earth exists. How did you find the new information you have learned? I hope that you now pay attention to the basic elements of a position paper. Prepare to examine one in the next activities. Good Luck! Everyone speaks about education and its importance. Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</a>

I will mark you the brainliest  if you help me thanks.The video tells us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they’re from, what they look and what their religion is. They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Our generation is living amidst what can be called as one of the greatest threats in our lifetime to global education. To persevere through this pandemic and persistently educate the coming few generations were treated as a priority at one point in the twelve months of quarantine we have been experiencing. This is how online learning was implemented, although regardless of how effective it may be, our first concern should be its affordability. Jobs and shops have been forced to shut down and it has hit a big impact on the mass' financial statuses, many of which still have children and teens to send to school. The government enforced online classes but failed to see that its price would not make it available to everyone. To pursue education is challenging enough, what more when quality education is the one you need.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Everything now has its limits. It is also difficult to keep up with the new policies of our country, but for the good of all we are ready to gamble. One of the things that has changed now is the state of education. The challenge of learning education is difficult for some Filipinos. During the height of the pandemic, it turned out that the last decision for education two years ago was modular distance learning and online classes.Make it hard to keep up because if the signal is not weak, there are no gadgets in the house. Even the parents have become temporary teachers of the children. Many have almost given up and some have even gotten pregnant.But it's not too late for everyone to give up. Because now everything is gradually getting better. Due to the decrease in the percentage of covids patient, DepED decided to reopen face to face classes again. It was difficult to keep up at first, but now it is little by little every Filipino learns.There is nothing difficult for our Filipinos because we are the example of people who do not give up easily just because of trials.</p><p><strong>New Normal In Education</strong></p><p>It has been difficult for some of our people to keep up with the new state of education today.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A holistic approach to education – that addresses students’ learning, social and emotional needs – is crucial, especially in times of crisis. School closures related to the current COVID-19 pandemic mean that students from diverse backgrounds who are more at risk of increased vulnerability are less likely to receive the support and extra services they need, and the gap between students that experience additional barriers and that do not might widen. Closures can also have considerable effects on students’ sense of belonging to schools and their feelings of self-worth – these are key for inclusion in education.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>follow mo Ako ❤️</p><p></p><br />

                            11. Essay: How do you see the world 50 years from now? In media:In economics:In education:​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>In media: </p><p>Fifty years after the first computer network was connected, most experts say digital life will mostly change humans’ existence for the better over the next 50 years. However, they warn this will happen only if people embrace reforms allowing better cooperation, security, basic rights and economic fairness.</p><p></p><p>In 50 years, internet use will be nearly as pervasive and necessary as oxygen. Seamless connectivity will be the norm, and it may be impossible to unplug. From amazing advancements to dystopian developments, experts imagine a wide array of possible scenarios for the world 50 years in the future.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In economics: </p><p>Since the Industrial Revolution, automation has had a heavy impact on employment that involves routine physical work; this is now intensifying and on top of that we’re seeing technology’s effects on many other areas, including information processing. Looking ahead, it’s estimated that almost 50% of the current jobs in existence will become automated, even in the ‘white-collar’ occupations, which have traditionally been resistant to automation.</p><p></p><p>These changes are not merely a phenomenon of the post-recession years, nor are they showing up in just one or two economies where they might be expected. Essentially, capital has been invested in technology – leading to greater automation – as opposed to labour. Over the coming 10 years, we will face huge, tectonic forces of globalization and astonishing technological progress – forces that must be confronted and embraced if we are to ensure economic opportunity and inclusiveness for all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In education:</p><p>Education has seen seismic changes in the last few decades. There are people alive that still remember using chalkboards in class, or writing on slates at their desk. Now, though, today's students have a wealth of technology literally at their finger tips. With technology developing at such a rapid pace, it's not stretch to imagine that education in 50 years will look very different. </p><p></p><p>Classrooms will become less important</p><p>This doesn't mean that learning itself will become less relevant. Instead, the actual, physical classroom is less vital towards creating a learning environment. We're already seeing huge advances in distance learning technology, with tools such as video calling and recording meaning anyone can attend a class, no matter where they are. In 50 years, we'll see students from all over the world attending the same classes, and interacting with each other.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Not sure but hope it helps po thank you</p><br />

It has become a vital tool in modern education as it provides students and teachers with various opportunities and advantages to enhance their teaching and learning experience.

These tools have helped to improve students' motivation and interest in learning, leading to better academic performance.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, ICT has made education more accessible and inclusive. Students from remote areas can now access quality education through online platforms such as video conferencing, e-learning, and virtual classrooms. This has provided equal opportunities for all students regardless of their geographical location, economic background, or physical disabilities. ICT has also made it possible for teachers to offer personalized learning experiences to students with diverse learning needs, thereby enhancing their academic performance.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, ICT has made it possible for teachers to save time and increase their efficiency. Through online resources and tools, teachers can now easily access and share teaching materials, grade assignments, and communicate with students and parents. This has helped to reduce their workload, giving them more time to focus on teaching and improving their students' learning experience.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, ICT has played a significant role in the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students. The integration of ICT in education has made it possible for students to participate in collaborative learning and research projects, allowing them to develop teamwork and communication skills. This has not only helped to improve their academic performance but also prepared them for the challenges of the modern world.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, the importance of ICT in education cannot be overstated. ICT has revolutionized the education sector by making learning more accessible, engaging, and inclusive. It has also provided teachers with various tools and resources to enhance their teaching experience, save time, and increase their efficiency. Furthermore, it has helped to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaborative skills among students.

However, it is important to remember that your schooling, no matter how long it may feel, lasts for just a few short years compared to the rest of your life ahead of you. Therefore, it is better to sacrifice a little bit of fun now so that you can find happiness in later life, as you will be happier if you can do a job that you enjoy and afford to do the things you want.

                        <p><strong>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity​</strong></p><p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are two crucial aspects of a person's identity that have been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. While some argue that individuals should have the right to express themselves and love who they choose, others argue that certain sexual orientations and gender identities are unnatural or immoral. However, it is important to recognize that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, sexual orientation is a natural and normal part of human diversity. People can have different sexual orientations, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual. It is not a choice but rather an inherent characteristic of an individual's identity. People cannot control who they are attracted to, and it is not something that can be changed or "cured" through therapy or other methods. Therefore, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of sexual orientations.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, gender identity is also an inherent part of a person's identity. Gender identity refers to an individual's sense of their own gender, which can be male, female, or non-binary. Like sexual orientation, gender identity is not a choice but rather a part of who a person is. It is important to recognize and respect the gender identity of individuals, regardless of whether it aligns with their biological sex.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ often face discrimination and marginalization in society. This discrimination can manifest in many ways, including harassment, violence, and unequal treatment in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare. This discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, and can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>In addition to discrimination, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ also face legal barriers that limit their rights and freedoms. For example, in many countries, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and LGBTQ+ individuals are denied the right to adopt children or access fertility treatments. These legal barriers can further contribute to the marginalization and discrimination of LGBTQ+ individuals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected. Discrimination and marginalization of individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity are not only unfair but also harmful. It is important for society to recognize the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting world for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p></p><br />

Essay on Education By: Priyanka Nagrale Countless words are written daily about the importance of education. Indubitably, education is the only valuable asset humans can achieve. Human evolution over eons is a result of education both formal and informal. Further, education is the sole basis on which the future of the human race depends. Our quest for knowledge is unending and will continue till planet Earth exists. How did you find the new information you have learned? I hope that you now pay attention to the basic elements of a position paper. Prepare to examine one in the next activities. Good Luck! Everyone speaks about education and its importance. Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</h2><br />

I will mark you the brainliest  if you help me thanks.The video tells us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they’re from, what they look and what their religion is. They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The video instructs us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they're from, how they appear, and what religion they follow. They also demonstrated how they are denied the opportunuty to receive a higher education. In our lives, education is the most essential thing a person that has in life. It is considered to be the key to life. It is disheartening to realize thst many people do not obtain the same education as others just because of their differences. We must extract the stereotypes and labels that was invented centuries ago. We are now living in a contemporary society, we must effect change and just live a tranquil life. As they put it, "we all share the same cosmos", so we must treat each of us equally and fairly. Equality should be spread around the world.</p><br />

                        It's difficult to set standards in the midst of a pandemic. Before this all began, we had deadlines, and they were either met or they weren't. When the pandemic began, for some high school teachers and college professors, sticking to deadlines was still a hard and fast rule. But other teachers offered some leniency to students, knowing everyone was having a difficult time. This system worked reasonably well for those students who felt unmotivated due to COVID-19. However, just like everything else, getting back on track will require some tinkering since this has become our new normal. Let’s explore why it’s important to adapt to the new normal and how you can be active in your communication with your teachers and professors for a better educational experience than you may have had last spring.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Some of us are Modular and also some is Online class, We all have problem in those things, such as having a poor network in Online class, and having an misunderstood in Module, and we all are stressed because of it, but the importance in that is keeping us all studying and having knowledge, the normal way is  easier, Its easy because there's a teacher who can explain and discuss the subject, you'll pass the Module or Online class if you listen well and read all the instructions.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>sana makatulong</p><br />

The sector of education is one of the most affected which leave us with no choice but the distance learning, either online or modular.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This forced platform requires not just the teachers but the students as well to work harder than before and change their mindsets. The lack of learning devices, unstable data connection and other new changes let all the people suffer from doing their school works. Students who are unprivileged are the most affected. They are at the disadvantage having less resources. No matter how hard they work, it wouldn’t be enough. Same with the students who have the resources but isn’t fast learning. Both parties are in difficulties but the education needs to be pursued. It’s a lot times better than continuing the face-to-face learning which gives us the higher risks of being infected by the virus.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Face-to-face learning is the better option because it provides a higher chance of regaining greater understanding in course subjects. As a result, you also stand a chance at completing your courses more successfully by attending class in person. </p><p></p><p>Face-to-face gives better motivation to study; instant feedback. It is too difficult to learn everything through computer. Face-to-face interaction with instructors is better for the learning process.

I recently had the chance to go on an educational tour with my classmates to a local museum, and it was an unforgettable experience.</p><p></p><p>During the tour, we were guided by a knowledgeable museum staff who shared valuable insights and information about the exhibits. We learned about the different eras of our country's history and how they shaped our present society. It was fascinating to see historical artifacts up close and understand their significance in shaping our culture and heritage.</p><p></p><p>Aside from gaining knowledge about history, the tour also provided us with an opportunity to bond with our classmates outside the classroom setting. We shared a lot of fun moments while exploring the exhibits and exchanging ideas about the things we saw. We also learned the importance of working together and respecting each other's opinions.</p><br />
