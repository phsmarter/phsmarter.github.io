The paragraph must contain 50-100 words. A rubric will be used to rate your work. Do this in a separate sheet of paper. Situation: An energy generating company would like to establish a run-off-river hydroelectric power plant in the existing dams in the province of Mapayapa. This type of facility works through redirecting river water flow through canals and feeding it downhill to a power station. At present, there are two dams situated in the mountainous terrain of Mapayapa and these are Kapayapaan Dam and Kabutihan Dam. Kapayapaan Dam has a height of 85 meters above sea level (masl). While the Kabutihan Dam has a height of 125 masl. For the run-off-river power plant to produce greater electric power, engineers must consider the gravitational potential energy possess by the dams. This energy should be enough to be converted into kinetic energy that will be used to turn the turbine at the powerhouse. They have to consider the location of the dam and where to build the powerhouse. If you were to be a member of the company that handles this project, what will be your suggestions? Which of the two dams will be ideal for the project and why?

Why is it important to always start with the scanning objective lens when observing specimens under the microscope?
We start with the scanning objective lens because it has the lowest magnification power. It gives the user an overview of the specimen. Furthermore, it allows the user to take in the entire field of view without any loss of detail. The other lenses have greater magnification, which decreases the scope of the specimen. Additionally, it makes it more challenging to see the entire area.
In which specimen is the use of the oil immersion objective lens needed? Why do you need to use lenses with higher magnification for specimens you have identified?
I needed oil immersion objective lenses for the Gram Stain Mix specimen. It can improve imaging. Lenses with higher magnification provide a more detailed view of the specimen. Moreover, it reveals details that would not be visible at lower magnifications. As a result, the user can use higher magnification lenses to ensure accurate analysis.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" is a powerful poem written by Maya Angelou that explores themes of oppression, racism, and the longing for freedom. The poem draws its inspiration from the caged bird, which serves as a metaphor for the African American experience during a time of segregation and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>The poem is divided into two stanzas, with the first stanza describing the free bird's life and the second stanza describing the caged bird's life. The free bird is portrayed as living a carefree and joyful life, enjoying the beauty of nature and the freedom to fly wherever it wishes. In contrast, the caged bird is described as being confined and oppressed, with its wings clipped and its ability to fly restricted.</p><p></p><p>The metaphor of the caged bird is used to illustrate the struggles of African Americans during a time when they were denied their basic human rights and treated as second-class citizens. The caged bird's song is described as being "a prayer back to heaven" and a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity.</p><p></p><p>The poem is also a powerful commentary on the human desire for freedom and the will to survive in the face of oppression. Despite being trapped and confined, the caged bird continues to sing, a testament to its determination to overcome its circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" is a deeply moving and thought-provoking poem that speaks to the human condition and the struggle for freedom and equality. Through the use of vivid imagery and powerful metaphor, Maya Angelou captures the essence of the African American experience and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>"I know why caged bird sings" is a powerful poem written by Maya Angelou  the explores them of oppression racism and the longing freedom. <br />

Support your suggestions by facts you have learned about work, energy and power. The paragraph must contain 50-100 words. A rubric will be used to rate your work. Do this in a separate sheet of paper. Situation: An energy generating company would like to establish a run-off-river hydroelectric power plant in the existing dams in the province of Mapayapa. This type of facility works through redirecting river water flow through canals and feeding it downhill to a power station. At present, there are two dams situated in the mountainous terrain of Mapayapa and these are Kapayapaan Dam and Kabutihan Dam. Kapayapaan Dam has a height of 85 meters above sea level (masl). While the Kabutihan Dam has a height of 125 masl. For the run-off-river power plant to produce greater electric power, engineers must consider the gravitational potential energy possess by the dams. This energy should be enough to be converted into kinetic energy that will be used to turn the turbine at the powerhouse. They have to consider the location of the dam and where to build the powerhouse. If you were to be a member of the company that handles this project, what will be your suggestions? Which of the two dams will be ideal for the project and why?

                            16. I'm supposed to write a conclusion for these answers but I'm not sure how please help.
Why is it important to always start with the scanning objective lens when observing specimens under the microscope?
We start with the scanning objective lens because it has the lowest magnification power. It gives the user an overview of the specimen. Furthermore, it allows the user to take in the entire field of view without any loss of detail. The other lenses have greater magnification, which decreases the scope of the specimen. Additionally, it makes it more challenging to see the entire area.
In which specimen is the use of the oil immersion objective lens needed? Why do you need to use lenses with higher magnification for specimens you have identified?
I needed oil immersion objective lenses for the Gram Stain Mix specimen. It can improve imaging. Lenses with higher magnification provide a more detailed view of the specimen. Moreover, it reveals details that would not be visible at lower magnifications. As a result, the user can use higher magnification lenses to ensure accurate analysis.
Please do not answer incorrectly for points or I will report your answer.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In conclusion, starting with the scanning objective lens when observing specimens under the microscope is crucial. It provides an overview of the specimen, allowing the user to take in the entire field of view without any loss of detail. The use of oil immersion objective lenses is needed for specimens like the Gram Stain Mix specimen to improve imaging, and lenses with higher magnification are necessary to provide a more detailed view of the specimen. By using higher magnification lenses, accurate analysis can be ensured, and important details that would not be visible at lower magnifications can be revealed. Therefore, it is essential to understand the appropriate use of different lenses when observing specimens under the microscope to obtain accurate and detailed results.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
