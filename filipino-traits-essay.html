This is the most common terminology that describes how Filipinos welcome foreigners or tourists who visit the country. This trait of the Filipinos towards their visitors is undeniably exceptional. Whenever a visitor stays in a Filipino home, there will be a feast or a grand celebration as it is somehow a tradition for us to prepare bountiful Filipino cuisine for guests to have a taste of our culture through food. In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors. To add to that, Filipino families are often more than willing to share not only their meals but their entire home as well. As a matter of fact, Filipinos would usually greet their visitors with the phrase "Feel at home!" to ensure that they are at ease during their stay. For Filipinos, it is a pleasure and the country's honor to accept foreigners as visitors and build genuine relationships and friendships with them. Indeed, this clearly shows that Filipinos are a warm and loving people. They give and share what they have for their guest even it means a little sacrifice on their part. But have they ever wondered and pondered on this question? Are they carrying the Filipinos' hospitality to the extremes? Now, it's your turn!

This is the most common terminology that describes how Filipinos welcome foreigners or tourists who visit the country. This trait of the Filipinos towards their visitors is undeniably exceptional. Whenever a visitor stays in a Filipino home, there will be a feast or a grand celebration as it is somehow a tradition for us to prepare bountiful Filipino cuisine for guests to have a taste of our culture through food. In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors. To add to that, Filipino families are often more than willing to share not only their meals but their entire home as well. As a matter of fact, Filipinos would usually greet their visitors with the phrase "Feel at home!" to ensure that they are at ease during their stay. For Filipinos, it is a pleasure and the country's honor to accept foreigners as visitors and build genuine relationships and friendships with them.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>La Indolencia de los Filipinos, more popularly known in its English version, "The Indolence of the Filipinos," is a exploratory essay written by Philippine national hero Dr. Jose Rizal, to explain the alleged idleness of his people during the Spanish colonization.
</p><p>SUMMARY
</p><p>            The Indolence of the Filipinos is a study of the causes why the people did not, as was said, work hard during the Spanish regime.  Rizal pointed out that long before the coming of the Spaniards, the Filipinos were industrious and hardworking.  The Spanish reign brought about a decline in economic activities because of certain causes:
</p><p>            First, the establishment of the Galleon Trade cut off all previous associations of the Philippines with other countries in Asia and the Middle East.  As a result, business was only conducted with Spain through Mexico.  Because of this, the small businesses and handicraft industries that flourished during the pre-Spanish period gradually disappeared.
</p><p>            Second, Spain also extinguished the natives’ love of work because of the implementation of forced labor.  Because of the wars between Spain and other countries in Europe as well as the Muslims in Mindanao, the Filipinos were compelled to work in shipyards, roads, and other public works, abandoning agriculture, industry, and commerce.
</p><p>            Third, Spain did not protect the people against foreign invaders and pirates.  With no arms to defend themselves, the natives were killed, their houses burned, and their lands destroyed.  As a result of this, the Filipinos were forced to become nomads, lost interest in cultivating their lands or in rebuilding the industries that were shut down, and simply became submissive to the mercy of God.
</p><p>            Fourth, there was a crooked system of education, if it was to be considered an education.  What was being taught in the schools were repetitive prayers and other things that could not be used by the students to lead the country to progress.  There were no courses in Agriculture, Industry, etc., which were badly needed by the Philippines during those times.
</p><p>            Fifth, the Spanish rulers were a bad example to despise manual labor.  The officials reported to work at noon and left early, all the while doing nothing in line with their duties.  The women were seen constantly followed by servants who dressed them and fanned them – personal things which they ought to have done for themselves.
</p><p>            Sixth, gambling was established and widely propagated during those times.  Almost everyday there were cockfights, and during feast days, the government officials and friars were the first to engange in all sorts of bets and gambles.
</p><p>            Seventh, there was a crooked system of religion.  The friars taught the naïve Filipinos that it was easier for a poor man to enter heaven, and so they preferred not to work  and remain poor so that they could easily enter heaven after they died.
</p><p>            Lastly, the taxes were extremely high, so much so that a huge portion of what they earned went to the government or to the friars.  When the object of their labor was removed and they were exploited, they were reduced to inaction.
</p><p>            Rizal admitted that the Filipinos did not work so hard because they were wise enough to adjust themselves to the warm, tropical climate.  “An hour’s work under that burning sun, in the midst of pernicious influences springing from nature in activity, is equal to a day’s labor in a temperate climate.”
