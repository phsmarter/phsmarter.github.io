                                            11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

The first argument is that captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals, including blindness, skin problems, and stress-related diseases. The second argument is that captivity leads to boredom and limited space, which causes dolphins to abuse themselves by banging their heads against tank and aquarium walls. The third argument is that some of these marine mammals face abusive treatment from their caretakers, which shortens their lifespan. The fourth argument is that marine mammals breed poorly in captivity with high infant death rates.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: The essay concludes that marine mammals should not be held in captivity and that it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

Discuss the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating local culture into education.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The Constructivist Theory and traditional teaching approaches differ significantly in the context of teaching MTB-MLE. Traditional teaching methods emphasize the teacher as the primary source of knowledge and use a standardized curriculum, while Constructivist Theory emphasizes active learning and student-centered approaches. In MTB-MLE, Constructivist Theory supports the use of local languages as a medium of instruction, which enables students to connect their learning to their own culture and experiences. Traditional teaching methods, on the other hand, may not be as effective in supporting students' language development and cultural identity.</p><p></p><p>2.Implementing a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE can be challenging because it requires a significant shift in teaching practices and the creation of culturally relevant materials. However, it can also provide opportunities for students to engage in active learning and develop critical thinking skills. The potential benefits of adopting a Constructivist approach include improved language development, increased engagement and motivation, and better academic performance. However, there may be drawbacks, such as the need for more resources and training for teachers. The effectiveness of a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE may also depend on the specific context and community in which it is being taught.</p><p></p><p>3.Knowing the mother tongue is significant in education because it enables learners to connect their learning to their own culture and experiences. Using the mother tongue as a medium of instruction can also improve learners' language development and overall academic performance. Additionally, using the mother tongue can help preserve and promote local languages and cultures. However, the disadvantages of using the mother tongue include limited access to learning materials and limited opportunities for students to learn additional languages that may be necessary for future academic and professional endeavors.</p><p></p><p>4.Understanding the local culture is important in education because it allows teachers to create culturally relevant materials and practices that engage students and promote learning. Incorporating local culture into teaching practices can also promote cultural diversity and respect. Effective incorporation of local culture involves engaging with the community, identifying local resources and practices, and creating learning materials that reflect students' experiences and cultural backgrounds. The potential benefits of incorporating local culture into education include increased student engagement and motivation, improved academic performance, and the promotion of cultural diversity. However, challenges may include limited resources and the need for cultural sensitivity and understanding</p><br />

It is not only for the sake of the mother and the baby but also for their future. If you have a baby that is only months apart, you will be having a big problem. Baby's milk and diaper is too expensive plus the time that you have to take care of them.      It is also hard on the part of the mother to bear a child with months apart only. Her body haven't healed from giving birth and then she will be having a baby again. Their is no more room for the mother to cope up from the stress of giving birth. Parent's should make sure that they can give the needs of the baby. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Grandparents</p><p>I was lucky enough to grow up in my grandparent’s house. Our family lived with my grandparents since I was little. As my paternal grandfather passed away when I was very young, I only remember a few memories of him. One thing I surely remember is he used to brush his teeth twice daily without fail. I adopted this habit and ever since I have been doing the same.</p><p></p><p>My maternal grandparents have been my true systems of support. I am lucky enough to have grown up around such inspirational people. My grandfather was a principal of a college, so he always emphasized the importance of education. He helped us with our homework when my parents were not available. I spent my vacations at their place as I enjoyed living with them.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, my grandparents always embraced me with open arms. They used to wait for every holiday for our arrival. My grandmother made delicious pickles and meals which we relished greatly. She taught me a few recipes too and tips and tricks that are very useful even today. I simply adore my grandparents for instilling good values in me and my parents and for giving us a safe space to grow up in.</p><br />

                        <p>Title: "The Challenges of Single Mothers in Raising Their Children"</p><p></p><p>1. Overall general information about your topic and its significance.</p><p></p><p>Being a single mother is a tough job, especially when it comes to raising children. It requires a lot of strength, hard work, and dedication. Single mothers have to take on the role of both parents, provide emotional support, and ensure that their children receive the best education and healthcare possible. Unfortunately, despite all their efforts, single mothers often face social stigma and discrimination. In this reflection essay, I will explore some of the challenges faced by single mothers and the impact it has had on my life.</p><p></p><p>2. How did it impact you as an individual?</p><p></p><p>As a person who has witnessed the struggles of a single mother firsthand, I have immense respect and admiration for those who have successfully raised their children alone. Growing up, I have seen my aunt, a single mother, work tirelessly to provide for my cousin. She had to juggle multiple jobs, raise her child, and take care of the household all by herself. I have watched her sacrifice her own needs to ensure that my cousin received the best education, healthcare, and opportunities available. She has done a remarkable job of raising her daughter, who is now a successful adult.</p><p></p><p>This experience has taught me the value of hard work, perseverance, and dedication. It has also shown me the importance of empathy and understanding in dealing with people from different backgrounds and situations. As a result, I have become a better listener and communicator, and I try my best to be more compassionate towards others.</p><p></p><p>3. Importance of learning and understanding the process of doing research and its practical application in life.</p><p></p><p>Research is an essential part of understanding complex issues and making informed decisions. It is particularly relevant in the case of single mothers, where evidence-based research can provide insights into the experiences of this group and inform policy decisions that can improve their lives.</p><p></p><p>As a student, I have learned the importance of doing research and its practical application in life. It has helped me develop critical thinking skills, improved my writing and communication skills, and enhanced my understanding of various issues, including the challenges faced by single mothers. The ability to conduct thorough research and analyze data is a valuable asset in any field, and I plan to utilize these skills in my future career.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, being a single mother is a difficult task that requires immense strength, hard work, and dedication. Witnessing the struggles of a single mother has taught me the value of perseverance, empathy, and understanding. It has also highlighted the importance of research in understanding complex issues and making informed decisions. As we continue to navigate these issues, it is crucial to support and empower single mothers, recognize their contributions to society, and work towards creating a more equitable and just society.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
