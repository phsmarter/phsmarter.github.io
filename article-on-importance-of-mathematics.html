By Ananya Mahapatra Source: https://www.atg.world/view-article/IMPORTANCEOFEDUCATION-70 Education is a learning experience where an individual learns about various aspects of life, understands the different perspectives and tries to apply it in daily life. Education is important to the children, to adults and to the society. Education gives people knowledge of the world around them and changes it into something better. It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, &quot;Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.&quot; This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one&#039;s life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position. While playing he will understand the logic to win it; this way they start building goals at an early stage. But parents should understand whether their children are working only for ranks and grades or acquiring some wisdom or not. It is important that they are aware of the purpose of education and how it works in real life. They start maintaining a structured life. To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions. The mind gets matured by proper education and training. A person can judge what is right and what is not. Education makes a person independent and helps him abide by the rules of the land. Education improves the standard of living of Written by: CLARIBEL C. BUENAVENTURA 3 the people. It helps people understand their needs and gives them the way to acquire them. Education provides a platform for a decent livelihood. One can take up a job in industry or another professional service if he/she is educated. Advances in medicine, war equipment, technology were possible due to constant exploration and research. People of current age carry this exploration. They could do so due to their education and knowledge about the past technology. People with higher education in science, mathematics, and technology can do this. The food production, medicine, electronic gadgets, automobiles and other luxury items were developed due to the spread of science and technology among the professionals through studies.

                                            CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

Situation Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.

Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to dovelop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 meter apart from others, wearing a properly filted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it's your tumn and follow local guidance The virus can spread from an infected person's mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and lo stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

                            1. What Is Education and Why Is It Important? By Ananya Mahapatra Source: https://www.atg.world/view-article/IMPORTANCEOFEDUCATION-70 Education is a learning experience where an individual learns about various aspects of life, understands the different perspectives and tries to apply it in daily life. Education is important to the children, to adults and to the society. Education gives people knowledge of the world around them and changes it into something better. It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one's life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position. While playing he will understand the logic to win it; this way they start building goals at an early stage. But parents should understand whether their children are working only for ranks and grades or acquiring some wisdom or not. It is important that they are aware of the purpose of education and how it works in real life. They start maintaining a structured life. To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions. The mind gets matured by proper education and training. A person can judge what is right and what is not. Education makes a person independent and helps him abide by the rules of the land. Education improves the standard of living of Written by: CLARIBEL C. BUENAVENTURA 3 the people. It helps people understand their needs and gives them the way to acquire them. Education provides a platform for a decent livelihood. One can take up a job in industry or another professional service if he/she is educated. Advances in medicine, war equipment, technology were possible due to constant exploration and research. People of current age carry this exploration. They could do so due to their education and knowledge about the past technology. People with higher education in science, mathematics, and technology can do this. The food production, medicine, electronic gadgets, automobiles and other luxury items were developed due to the spread of science and technology among the professionals through studies. To be a better human, an active participant in society and to gain respect from the world one should always learn new things. Leaming new things in education.

                            3. CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

                            5. CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT MORAL VALUES IN SCHOOL” (Tulfo, 2012)   The knowledge students learn from mathematics, science, history and languages will amount to nothing if schools do not teach them moral values and respect for the rights of others as well. Moral values, or ethics and respect for others, should be a major subject from kindergarten up to the college level. Moral values involve the principles of knowing right from wrong, while respect for the rights of others is self-explanatory. Children, who are the country’s future leaders and followers, should learn moral values and respect the rights of others early. This is more important than accumulating knowledge since having moral values and respect for others forms the basis of a child’s future behaviour. We’re not talking religion here; we’re talking about discipline as a way of life. A disciplined citizenry makes for a prosperous nation. First World nations, like Japan, have disciplined citizens. The Philippines is a Third World country because most of its people are undisciplined. Examples of the lack of moral values and disrespect for the rights of others are easy to spot in our streets. Drivers and motorists cross a red light when there are no cops around (lack of moral values), and do not slow down or stop when approaching a pedestrian lane even when a pedestrian is crossing (disrespect for the rights of others). I’ve been a witness to many near-accidents when cars, taxicabs, buses and jeepneys maintain their speed even while people cross a pedestrian lane. I’ve also seen police cars—yes, police cars—beating a red light when their flashers are not on, meaning they’re not answering an emergency call. The policemen riding in those police cars that violated traffic rules wanted to feel important. Ordinary citizens who see cops violate traffic rules also do the same because the small monkey imitates the actions of the big monkey. Writing Activity Guide Question: 1.

Situation Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.

Get vaccinated when it's your tumn and follow local guidance The virus can spread from an infected person's mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and lo stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.
