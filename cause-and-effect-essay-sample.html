Question text
Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.

How the Harry Potter Series Became So Popular The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, is perhaps the most popular set of novels of the modern era. With seven books and many blockbuster films to its name, the series has amassed about 15 billion dollars in sales. How did this phenomenon become what it is? For those scratching their heads, the reason can be broken down into several areas: Rowling garnered a generous initial contract for her book, separate book covers were created for both teens and adults, midnight releases/promotions/pre-orders made the public more fanatic about the series, and fan blogs were rampant. In fact, these are just a few of the main reasons why the Harry Potter took off the way it did. Source: Aquino, J. (2019) How the Harry Potter Series Become so Popular.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>TOPIC : STUDY HABITS OF A JUNIOR STUDENT.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As a junior high school student, I have encountered some problems when it comes to distance learning. One of the main problems is distractions. When I'm studying, my phone keeps buzzing, and my siblings or parents keep talking to me. It's hard to concentrate, and I tend to get sidetracked easily. Another issue is the lack of motivation. Sometimes, I don't feel like studying, and I procrastinate until it's too late.</p><p></p><p>The problems that I have in distance learning are caused by the environment around me. Since I'm at home, there are a lot of things that distract me. My siblings are also studying from home, so it can get noisy and chaotic at times. It's also hard to maintain a routine since I don't have a strict schedule like in school.</p><p></p><p>To overcome these problems, I have come up with some solutions. First, I try to create a conducive environment for studying. I make sure that I'm in a quiet room, and I turn off my phone or put it on silent mode. I also try to study during hours when my siblings are not too busy with their online classes. Second, I try to motivate myself by setting goals and rewards. For example, if I finish studying for two hours straight, I reward myself with a snack or a short break.</p><p></p><p>My study habits involve a balance between studying and other activities. I make sure that I have enough time for my hobbies and interests, so I don't get burnt out. I also try to take breaks in between study sessions to rest my mind and recharge. When it comes to understanding topics, I read the materials thoroughly and take down notes. If there's something that I don't understand, I search for more information online or ask my teacher during our online class.</p><p></p><p>To prove that my study habits are effective, I would show my grades and how I was able to cope with the challenges of distance learning. I would also share my tips and tricks with my classmates and encourage them to try it out for themselves. Ultimately, the best way to prove that my study habits work is by consistently performing well in school and achieving my goals.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Question text
Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student who has been doing distance learning for more than a year now, I have encountered several problems that affect my study habits. One of the common issues I encounter is the lack of motivation to study. Since there is no physical classroom and no face-to-face interaction with the teacher, it is easy to lose motivation and procrastinate. Another problem I face is the difficulty of asking questions and getting immediate feedback from the teacher. Sometimes, I have to wait for a long time before I get a response from the teacher.</p><p></p><p>The problems that I encounter in distance learning are caused by several factors. One of which is the lack of structure and routine. Without a set schedule, it is easy to fall into a trap of not studying at all or studying inconsistently. Another factor is the lack of social interaction. Learning is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about building relationships and interacting with other people. Without this aspect, it can be difficult to stay motivated.</p><p></p><p>To overcome these problems, I have developed several solutions that help me learn best despite not having a face-to-face class. Firstly, I have created a schedule that I follow every day. This schedule includes dedicated study time and breaks in between. Secondly, I make sure to ask questions whenever I have one. I email my teacher or classmates for clarification or set up a virtual meeting with them. Thirdly, I try to make online learning more interactive by participating in online discussions, group projects, and other activities.</p><p></p><p>My study habits include several techniques that help me understand the topics even without the presence of my teacher. These include taking detailed notes, watching online tutorials, and reviewing past lessons. I also make use of online resources such as e-books, online libraries, and research databases.</p><p></p><p>To prove to other students that my study habits are effective, I would show them my grades and the amount of knowledge I have acquired. I would also encourage them to try out my study techniques and see for themselves the results. Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of discipline and consistency in distance learning. By following a set schedule and staying motivated, anyone can succeed in online learning.</p><p></p><p><strong>Notes</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>Good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>luck</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pag</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sulat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>bro</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mahaba</strong><strong> </strong><strong>yan</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Advice</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lang</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i-pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>print</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>nalang.</strong></p><p></p><br />

How the Harry Potter Series Became So Popular The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, is perhaps the most popular set of novels of the modern era. With seven books and many blockbuster films to its name, the series has amassed about 15 billion dollars in sales. How did this phenomenon become what it is? For those scratching their heads, the reason can be broken down into several areas: Rowling garnered a generous initial contract for her book, separate book covers were created for both teens and adults, midnight releases/promotions/pre-orders made the public more fanatic about the series, and fan blogs were rampant. In fact, these are just a few of the main reasons why the Harry Potter took off the way it did. Source: Aquino, J. (2019) How the Harry Potter Series Become so Popular.
