                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Inclusive. Innovative. Interconnected.
</p><p>
</p><p>This year's theme for the Annual National Congress spearheaded by the Philippines Librarians Association, Inc. in partnership with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, is quite interesting at hand.
</p><p>
</p><p>The three words involved in the theme, even though are common in the English language are quite connected with each other in terms of its objectivity for our libraries.
</p><p>
</p><p>Inclusive or inclusivity stands for, no man is left alone. Libraries are encouraged to create a more diverse and equal environment through its resources and what else they can add into this.
</p><p>
</p><p>Innovative or innovation on the other hand, gives our libraries the encouragement to not pause into hard bound books but try to keep up with the latest changes and innovations in our technology to make things more interesting to our audience.
</p><p>
</p><p>Lastly, interconnected is on the part where we all are connected somehow. Be it in terms of our interest, culture or history. Especially with us, Filipinos, we always have the sense of family bond even with people we've just met or people who's not blood-related to us.
</p><p>
</p><p>This year's theme, if passed on properly and executed in the right terms will definitely be a huge thing for our libraries and us as well.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We live in a society that's rapidly changing and morphing far from our parents and grandparents can ever imagine. Yet in some way, the innate goal for a progressive, modern and harmonious remains the same. We all want to live in a society that accepts who we are as long as we pursue noble aspirations, a society that celebrates science and technology as pinnacle of human achievement and a society that embraces cooperation and a bit of healthy competition among its constituents to move forward.</p><p></p><p>Inclusivity, Innovation and Interconnectedness. All three words start with the letter 'I' and may very well begin with the idea of 'I' as in 'I, a human being'. But its end-result definitely leads to 'we, as a people'.</p><p></p><p>But why should these three words form the foundation of a society we want to live in? Let's break each down:</p><p></p><p>Inclusive  </p><p>When you say a society, a corporation, a school or a barangay is inclusive, it means it accepts all people regardless of physical attributes, gender, sexual identity, age and race. It treats everyone the same, and in some ocassions, it offers opportunities for those who were not physically endowed such as an amputee or a blind person, to perform like a normal person. It doesn't discriminate nor judged based on superficiality.</p><p></p><p>Innovative</p><p>Human potential is virtually limitless. As the famous saying goes, the human capacity to develop and create new technologies entirely depends on his will to do so. In an innovative world, curiosity, thirst for knowledge and creativity are strongly encouraged.

This also means sustainability which can benefit the planet and the future generations.</p><p></p><p>Interconnected</p><p>It's difficult to be 'disconnected' these days. Even our smartphones demand us to be connected at all times. But interconnected is more than that. It simply means acknowledging the notion that we are part of a whole and we must do our part to make the whole thing work.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Electricity is the presence and flow of electric charge. It was first used in 1882 in New York. Many years have passed where electricity is very useful in many ways since it made people's tasks and lives easier. An example of it is an electric bulb; an electric bulb only works when there is electricity.  It only perform its task which is providing light to a certain area. Now if we think wisely, a year would be difficult for people because they will be doing tasks manually- an example of it is a candy factory. If a candy factory do not run electricity, factory workers will do it with their bare hands like mixing ingredients. But talking about with the use of electricity, their machines/robots would take part of the job and save time.</p><br />

it’s a MUST to change. Change is something we need to ponder on especially if
it’s up to something that will benefit us for the better good. Assuming that

a way that it will make everything scrupulous. We all have different mindset on

                        <strong>Answer:The meaning of “liberating education through innovation” is “freeing education through transformation” in simpler terms.  
</strong><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Here are some thoughts that can trigger your thoughts to come out too to help you out in your essay about “liberating education through innovation”.  
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Education has long been part of this world. Currently, our world is already experiencing continuous transformations through technology and globalization. Embracing innovation in education system will enable education to reach greater heights that will enable students and teachers to improve for the better. It is only through openness to good changes will education be able to cope up with the swift improvements of our world.  
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Current examples of innovations in education is the setting up of online classes in the internet. Before, attending school is only confined in the four walls of the classroom. Now, anyone can already learn online through online classes, without the need to go to school physically. This shows that education was able to cope up and maximize the wide usage of the internet anywhere in the world. Moreover, this milestone is a true manifestation that education is truly for anyone, regardless where they are or how they learn.  
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Another example of the role of innovation in education is the usage of Youtube materials during class discussions. Before, teachers only use the blackboard, Manila paper or overhead projector to discuss a topic more clearly. Now, teachers and professors already use education Youtube videos to catch the attention of their students, and let the students understand the topics more.  </strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>Essay about your innovation experiences<p><strong>The biggest secret of innovation is that anyone can do it. The reason is simple: It’s just not that hard. Look up the word “innovate” in any dictionary and see what it actually means, instead of what you think it means. You’ll find something like this: To innovate is “to introduce something new.” That’s it. It doesn’t say you need to be a creative genius, a workaholic, or even have on clean underwear. It’s just three little words: introduce something new. And I promise that by the end of this essay, you’ll have all the secrets needed to do it yourself.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The biggest secret of innovation is that anyone can do it.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Electronic businesses have become extremely popular in the recent years. More and more people prefer to buy and sell products and services online. It is rather important for those, who are in e-commerce business, to realize all advantages and disadvantages of performing their business over the internet or other computer networks. In the modern technological era business leaders have to be accustomed to such issues as internet marketing, electronic funds transfer, online transaction processing, supply chain management, automated collection data systems, inventory management systems and electronic data interchange (Kelly, 2005). Using a SWOT analysis will give the opportunity to improve better methods and strategies while conducting an e-commerce business. That is why it is essential to be well aware of the appropriate information, knowledge, experience and great desire to succeed in business, no matter whether it is small or big. The understanding of the main principles and techniques of conducting an e-commerce business will give the advantage to increase the company`s revenues and incomes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Electronic </strong><strong>Business</strong></p><p></p><p>Conducting electronic business online has advantages and disadvantages. To identify these features, the business owners are prone using SWOT analysis.. The internal strengths of my business were a wide range of capabilities it could have in future, because of the innovations and technology it could provide in the business operation. Experience, knowledge and data are real strengths to develop it into well-established. The personnel possess professional experience, deep knowledge in the marketing environment and professional skills. The company`s data is a valuable source that can be implemented into achieving its objectives. As to the weaknesses, lack of capabilities may be identified because of the competition in the market, where other e-commerce companies are selling the same products and services. It is essential to overcome the lack of competitive gap. While estimating the company`s opportunities, it has become obvious that it reaches the target markets making a good profit. Innovation and technology development is a good tendency that is currently occurs in the business process. Making e-commerce business globally gives a great opportunity to open new markets and find new customers. New contracts and partners are rather threatening to e-commerce. It is hard to identify what kind of partners and customers could be met online. Sometimes new contracts do not give desired results and profit. Loss of resources is another threat. It is not easy to find new sources of resources, thus, e-commerce may lose the money. The research reported that it is very important to identify all these positive and negative factors while achieving the company`s objectives (Kotler, 2009). </p><p></p><br />

You can get ideas from these thoughts so that you can jumpstart and accomplish your own essay regarding the topic. </p><p>Based on the theme, education must achieve freedom through innovation, which includes technology. Education has long been establised here on earth. It cannot be denied that the education system contains outdated processes, old materials and old systems. Educators and institutions can capitalize the boom of innovation and technology to improve the education system that is being offered to students. The education system in the Philippines is slowly riding on the boom of innovation and technology. For example, during the 1990's, teachers heavily use overhead projectors, and what we called "Manila papers" to present various topics to the students. Due to innovation and technology, teachers now use laptops, Powerpoint materials, and Youtube videos to discuss various topics to their students. The usage of laptops, Powerpoint materials, and Youtube videos now enable teachers to prepare teaching materials faster, and catch the attention of their students easily. </p><p>I am sure that you can also cite more examples on how education can still be improved through innovation and technology.

                            18. why do musical styles of 20th century truly unique and innovativeessay po yan:)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: 20th century music</strong></p><p>During the 20th century there was a large increase in the variety of music that people had access to. Prior to the invention of mass market gramophone records (developed in 1892) and radio broadcasting (first commercially done ca. 1919–20), people mainly listened to music at live classical music concerts or musical theatre shows; informally at music halls, or in pubs and fairs; on early phonograph players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, sometimes using sheet music. The ability to read music or play certain instruments and classical styles of music tended to be limited to middle-class and upper-class individuals, while singing and performing folk music and work songs was mainly limited to working class people. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of songs and musical pieces from around the globe. This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of classical and popular music, including symphonies, operas, and folk music, that they would not normally hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region or social class.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including vinyl records, compact cassettes, compact discs (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, digital audio recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the Internet, using file sharing of digital audio recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.[1] The introduction of multitrack recording in 1955 and the use of mixing had a major influence on pop and rock music, because it enabled record producers to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.[2] The development of sound recording and audio engineering technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the Musique concrète (1949) and acousmatic[3] (1955) schools of electronic composition.
</p><p>
</p><p>In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler, the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. Saxophones were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras generally include a string section, woodwinds, brass instruments, percussion, piano, celeste, harp(s),[4] with other instruments called for occasionally, such as electric guitar[5] and electric bass.[6]
</p><p>
</p><p>The 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of altered chords and extended chords in 1940s-era Bebop jazz. The development of powerful, loud guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement systems in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of jazz and rock music to create jazz fusion). As well, composers and musicians used new electric, electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Noisemakers were introduced to make 20th-century music's tone color richer and more intriguing. New chord structures were adopted, and the harmonies became more discordant. Tonality was less important to composers, and some entirely ignored it. Music became more unpredictable as rhythms were broadened and melodies made bigger jumps. Musical styles diverged in ways they had never done before in the twentieth century. During this century, aleatory, atonality, serialism, musique concrète, electronic music, and concept music were all developed.</p><br />

                        <p>Over the years that the humans have walk upon the earth there have been countless technological innovations, some dating back to the Stone Age.  Although the ancient world didn’t have all the resources that we have today, the people of those times did magnificent things that paved the road for us today; from the stone tools made in Paleolithic and Mesolithic times to the wheel in 3000 BC, all the stone-toolsway to the pyramids in 2560 BC.  These inventions helped make it possible for us to build smartphones, remote controls, and skyscrapers</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods humans used stone tools.  These stone tools are the oldest technology that has evidence surviving.  The humans would use flakes of rock, usually flint, to make different tools.  For example, the oldwan choppers, seen to the right, were designed to help break things down.  These stone tools can be compared to smartphones, the most useful tool of today.  While the humans of the past had a different shape designed for different tasks, today we have “an app for that.”  Smartphones have different apps designed for each task; likewise there are different designs of stone for each objective.  A smartphone is a tool that most people today could not live without.  Like the stone tools, a smartphone is designed to make the lives of people easier.  Lastly, stone tools were refined by Neolithic farmers.  Theses farmers sharpened the stone tools, making them better suited for hunting spears and knives.  The same goes for the smartphone.  It seems like every other month there is a new update to make the device better suited for the task at hand.</p><p></p><p>With the inventing of the wheel, transportation was put on another level.  Although it is believed that the first wheels were meant </p><p></p><p>the-wheelfor pottery in Mesopotamia, they ended up being an invention that changed the way humans traveled.  The remote is a great innovation to society.  The remote, like the wheel, changed the lives of humans.  Before the wheel, people would have to walk everywhere.  In the same way, the remote made it so we did not have to get up to change a channel on the television.  The remote made life easier for people, as did the wheel.
