                            2. write a narrative essay entitled "my most memorable trip"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It was the summer of my sophomore year in college, and I had been saving up for months to take a trip with my best friend, Sarah. We had decided to travel to Europe, a place we had both dreamed of visiting for years. Our itinerary was packed with sightseeing and adventure, but little did we know, one experience would stand out above all others.</p><p></p><p>Our journey began in London, where we spent three days exploring the city's iconic landmarks, such as the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace. We then took a train to Paris, where we strolled through the charming streets and indulged in the city's famous cuisine. From there, we ventured to Amsterdam, where we marveled at the city's stunning canals and visited the Anne Frank House.</p><p></p><p>But it was our next destination, Venice, that would be etched in our memories forever. As soon as we arrived, we were struck by the city's unique beauty, with its winding canals and stunning architecture. We decided to take a gondola ride through the city, and it turned out to be one of the most magical experiences of our lives.</p><p></p><p>As we drifted along the canals, we were surrounded by the sound of water lapping against the boat and the gentle murmur of Italian voices. Our gondolier, a friendly man with a thick accent, pointed out the city's landmarks and regaled us with stories of Venice's history. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the city, and the colors of the buildings seemed to dance in the light.</p><p></p><p>But then, something unexpected happened. As we approached a small bridge, our gondolier began to sing. His voice was rich and full, and the song was in Italian, a language we didn't understand, but the melody was beautiful. As he sang, the other gondoliers around us joined in, their voices harmonizing in perfect unison. It was as if the entire city had come alive with music.</p><p></p><p>Sarah and I looked at each other, tears in our eyes, and knew that this moment would stay with us forever. We were in awe of the beauty of the city and the warmth of its people. It was a feeling of pure joy and wonder that we will never forget.</p><p></p><p>After our gondola ride, we walked around the city, feeling like we were in a dream. We stopped at a small café and sipped espresso while we watched the sunset over the Grand Canal. We talked about our trip, our hopes and dreams, and the people we had met along the way.</p><p></p><p>As we left Venice the next day, we knew that we had experienced something truly special. Our trip had been full of incredible moments, but our gondola ride and the impromptu concert on the canal was a memory that would always stand out. It reminded us that travel is not just about seeing new places but also about connecting with people, experiencing new cultures, and being open to unexpected moments of beauty and joy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope it helps </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Two particular road trips come to mind.</p><p></p><p>I had just got my license a few months prior and my best friend and I were trying to think up something fun to do. We decided to get in the car, only cigarettes, our sense of humor, and a coin to flip. We decided our sense of direction by letting the coin decide for us. Heads go left, tails go right. We had never had so much fun. Laughing as we came to a dead end, fields on either side of us; encountering wild experiences (a large white figure; we thought a ghost came ripping out of a corn field diving in front of my car and it turned out to be a large crane); talking about everything and driving all night filling up as we went to end up in the most random places.</p><p>My fiance and I most recently traveled from our home in upper michigan out west to yellowstone national park over a period of 2 weeks. Camping in national parks along the way, absorbing new culture, visiting national monuments and experiencing phenomenal views, laughing at radio comic books, playing road games and making up our own, enjoying each others company and undivided attention, rekindling the romance in our life, renting a condo nestled against the beartooth mountains in Montana, and creating some of the best memories together only to inspire future adventures together.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>GOD BLESS:)</p><br />

All days we come across in our life are not the same. Some are memorable. Memorable day is the funniest and happiest day of our life. However, memories are not just the ones that make us feel like we are in heaven. Sometimes, it is unforgettable because of the joy and fun that has given to us. Be it either good or bad, it will still be the part of us, our life. It will remain in us forever, everywhere we walk. When we think about this day or memory, we are very happy and we want to smile or we are sad and we want to cry. In my opinion, everyone has a special memory that they will never forget.

She told me that I have secured 98%.I thanked god the almighty for the success which he granted me. Then I ran to my parents and gave them the good news. They were overwhelmed with joy. My sisters and cousins got up and rejoiced.

</p><p>The whole atmosphere of the house was at once changed. Friends and relatives poured in to congratulate me. Tea and sweets were served to all who came. Many of my relatives brought sweet-boxes for me. All were in jolly and happy mood. My mother prepared nice dishes for the lunch. Never before I was so happy.
</p><p>At 11:30 a.m. I went to the school. I met the principal and other teachers. They all congratulated me. Many other girls also came to school. We embraced with each other. Our joys knew no bound. In midst of all rejoicing, I felt sorry for some of my friends who could not do well in the examination.

                        <p>              <strong>           "The Most Memorable Day of my Life"</strong><br />      The most memorable day of my life was, September 4, 1995 in Chicago, IL. It was 6:00 a.m. when my alarm clock woke me up. The first day of high school was finally here. I was excited, but a lot more nervous. I got out of bed, got ready, and then was on my way to the bus stop. All I could think of is the stories I heard about high school being so horrible with all the mean teachers, the hard tests, and of course being a freshman does not help either. The bus ride to the school was only 30 minutes, but it seemed a lot longer. When we finally got there, I was more nervous than ever. The day ahead of me was about to get a lot more…show more content…</p><p>        Their names were Susan and Alicia. I called them over and I talked with Susan and Alicia. That is when I introduced myself, then they did the same and we began to know more about each other, Susan and Alicia asked me where I was from and I said, “I am from Puerto Rico.” Then I asked Susan and Alicia where they were from and Susan said, “She was from New York” and Alicia said, “She was from Indiana”. After that, we spent the rest of the day together until the class was over. I will always remember that day because I had a chance to meet new friends. In addition, I met the most important friends that I have ever had.</p><p>    As the school year progressed, I made many more friends that are new and even joined a club. This club was just for members of the football team, the student staff, and the cheerleaders. My friends and I became members because we were the team equipment managers. The name of our club was the dog pound. We had t-shirts and worked all the school events when the football team was involved, such as the home coming game and pep rallies, we had fun all year long. My friends and I were even members of the food service program. We cooked and served meals for different events and for different people in the school all year long. We also had cooking competitions were we won different types of awards and sometimes we were offered scholarships to different cooking schools. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Back when I was 11- I was riding my bike down the street one Sunday afternoon. Then a car shows up behind me and an older girl on her bike all of a sudden is in front of me. So I try to ride through a neighbor's yard to get out of her way- but I end up going into a curb and fall off of my bike.</p><p></p><p>I fell into a wooden fence built around the neighbor's mailbox. My head went right into it and my skin above my left eye got cut. It opened right up and blood started leaking out. The girl then gets off her bike and says she is really sorry.</p><p></p><p>My parents were outside in our front yard right next door and came running over. The girl's dad passes by on his bike and gets off to help. Then the neighbors come out as they heard me screaming. They said they were terribly sorry I got hurt and wanted to know if they could do anything.</p><p></p><p>My mom said she was going in our house and coming back with a wet washcloth to put over my cut. The girl's dad was holding me upward and telling me to NOT lower my head until my mom is back with that washcloth to put on it.</p><p></p><p>That girl was saying she felt really bad and knew it was her fault because I could have kept going forward if she had NOT been there. My mom did come back with the wet washcloth and finally got it over that cut. The washcloth became 'completely red' in less than two minutes.</p><p></p><p>Then my parents thanked that girl's dad for helping and helped me walk to the mini-van we had back then. They said I was being taken to the local clinic where a doctor could give me stitches. My twin brother was told to go get my bike from the neighbor's yard and bring it into the garage where it always is.</p><p></p><p>So we went riding over to the clinic and came in with lots of people already there. We were told that the doctor had to see a lot of other patients before helping us- but he would give me the stitches I needed before the end of the day.</p><p></p><p>A few hours passed with us sitting on a couch looking at the TV in the waiting room. Some nurse did provide me with a bandaged cloth to hold over my cut as the washcloth had gotten yucky. The bleeding eventually stopped and the cut itself just had to be sewn back up.</p><p></p><p>I finally was taken into the doctor's room and we were told he would be with us. My dad took me back there while my mom stayed with my brother in the waiting room. The man eventually walked in and said what he would be doing.</p><p></p><p>He explains that he will be giving me shots in the cut area so I will NOT be able to feel the pain from 'the stitching'. Then he warns me that is going to hurt a little and I need to hold very still as he does it. So he sticks the needles there and it was only as bad as somebody pinching you.</p><p></p><p>After giving me the shots- he then sews up the cut and says the stitches in there will have to stay for up to five days. He tells my dad that I need to be given medicine for it every night and a new band-aid must be put on over the stitches before I go to bed.</p><p></p><p>We finally left after that and I had to go to school the next day. I remember having to give my P.E. teacher a note from the clinic telling her to excuse me from participating in all activities. So I got to just sit down while everyone else was doing the exercises and physical activities.</p><p></p><p>When Friday finally came- my mom picked me up from the school and drove me back to the clinic. We went into the doctor's room and a nurse cut the stitches off. My cut was in the process of healing and I still have a scar in that area from it over 25 years later.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p>#LearnAtBrainly</p><p>#BrainlyOnlineEducation</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>bonding with family and recognition in school</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The most memorable gift I have ever received was a book from my grandfather when I was 10 years old. It was a collection of classic fairy tales, which he had personally selected and compiled for me. I remember feeling overwhelmed with happiness when I received it because I had always loved reading and fairy tales.</p><p></p><p>What made this gift so memorable was not just the content of the book, but the thought and effort that my grandfather had put into selecting and compiling it. He had taken the time to understand my interests and chosen something that would bring me joy and enrich my imagination.</p><p></p><p>Years later, when my grandfather passed away, the book became even more precious to me as it reminded me of him and his love for me. It taught me the value of thoughtful gestures and the importance of preserving memories. I still have the book with me today, and it continues to hold a special place in my heart.</p><br />

                            27. "Most Memorable Success or Failures as a Student"             
essay type 100 word </h2><br />
                        <p>As a student, my most memorable success was when I received an academic award for being at the top of my class. It was a proud moment for me as I worked hard to achieve this recognition. It made me realize that all the effort and time I put into studying paid off. On the other hand, my most memorable failure was when I received a failing grade on a major exam. I was devastated and disappointed in myself. However, it taught me a valuable lesson that failure is a part of life, and it's how we respond to it that matters. It motivated me to work harder and strive for better results.</p>As a student, I have had my share of successes and failures, which have taught me valuable lessons about life. My most memorable success was when I graduated from high school with flying colors, while my most significant failure was when I flunked my first college course.<br /><br />My high school graduation was the pinnacle of my academic success since I had stayed focused and disciplined throughout my academic journey. I had managed to balance my studies, extracurricular activities, and social life, which contributed significantly to my success. I had also maintained a positive attitude and remained motivated, despite the challenges I encountered. I remember feeling elated when I received my diploma, knowing that all my hard work had paid off.<br /><br />My college life started on a low note when I failed my first course. I was overconfident and assumed that the college workload would be similar to that of high school. I neglected my studies and instead focused on making new friends and having fun. Consequently, I performed dismally, and it was a humbling experience. However, I learned an essential lesson from my failure, that college life requires discipline, time management, and prioritization. I had to work harder and become more organized to catch up with my peers.<br /><br />Another success I'm proud of is when I received a scholarship to study abroad. This achievement was a result of my commitment to excellence and dedication to my studies. It was an opportunity to explore new cultures, gain knowledge and skills, and make lifelong connections. I was excited to be part of a diverse academic community and learn new things that would benefit me both academically and personally.<br /><br />On the other hand, my most significant failure in college was when I procrastinated on my thesis, and I missed the deadline. Despite knowing the importance of submitting it on time, I did not take it seriously, and I paid the price. It was a significant setback, and I had to repeat the semester. However, I learned that procrastination is never productive and that time management is key in achieving academic success.<br /><br />In conclusion, as a student, I have experienced both success and failure, which have shaped my academic journey. While my successes have given me a sense of pride, my mistakes and failures have taught me valuable lessons. I have learned to be disciplined, organized, and focused on my academic goals. I am confident that with the lessons I have learned, I can overcome any challenges that may come my way and achieve excellence academically and beyond.<br />
