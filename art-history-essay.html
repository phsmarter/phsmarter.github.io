They reflect the range of artistic influences on the country's culture, including indigenous forms of the arts, and how these influences have honed the country's arts. These arts are divided into two distinct branches, namely, traditional arts[1] and non-traditional arts.[2] Each branch is further divided into various categories with subcategories.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>                                            Classical Music</strong></p><p>When the thought of music comes to mind I never really looked past the music that I listen to on a day to day basis which consists of country, pop, R&amp;B and rap. I never really gave any other types of music a chance. All of this has changed since I have taken Enjoyment of Music. In this class I learned that modern day music is not the only music that I could listen to and enjoy. I always believed that classical music was boring, but in the end I came to realize that I do really enjoy it.</p><p>             After the first day of class and learning that I would have to go to five classical music concerts I was not really thrilled. Throughout the semester and attending these five concerts I have come to the conclusion that I really do like classical music. Classical music to me can not only be enjoyable, but a tool. I learned that while listening to classical music while I was studying helped me concentrate more and all and all helped me do better on tests. Also it can make you feel better in a variety of different situations. An example of a situation would be when I was really frustrated after a hard day and did not want to listen to any kind of pop or rap music, so I turned on classical music. I found that my favorite musician is Vanessa Mae, the violin player. Her music can help me concentrate, relax, and make me feel better any time. I have also just recently noticed that I have been listening to classical music a lot more than the music that I would usually listen to.</p><p>             With this music class we had to attend five concerts. With attending these five concerts we had to write responses about the concert. I think writing the responses were an excellent way to reflect on all the music that you heard. The concerts were all so powerful and had different meanings which made them interesting.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a literary work, film, or other narrative, the plot is the sequence of events where each affects the next one through the principle of cause-and-effect.

Plots can vary from the simple—such as in a traditional ballad—to forming complex interwoven structures, with each part sometimes referred to as a subplot or imbroglio.</p><p></p><br />
