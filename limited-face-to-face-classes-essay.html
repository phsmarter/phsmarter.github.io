                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I believe that Face to Face learning is better than online learning because students have access to various learning resources on campus verses off. Face to face allows students to have instant gratification with answers and help. When a student is in class they can ask questions while it is fresh on their mind or help with a particular problem. If the student was at home online they would have to wait for the instructor to email them back. </p><p></p><p>Face to face students also gain from socialization with peers and interaction with teachers.

                            4. essay about limited face to face class in low risk areas​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As several local government units and private schools are requesting to hold limited face-to-face classes in low-risk areas, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on Tuesday approved its conduct starting next year.
</p><p>
</p><p>This development came after the Department of Education (DepEd) received queries from local chief executives, legislators, private and international schools, and other education stakeholders on the possibility of conducting limited face-to-face classes in areas where it is deemed safe to do so by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) and the Department of Health (DOH).
</p><p>
</p><p>Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones noted that limited face-to-face classes will ONLY be allowed upon the request of the LGU and school concerned and can only happen January 2021 under conditions set by the DOH, DepEd and IATF.
</p><p>
</p><p>Moreover, it can only be considered in low-risk areas or in areas at least under Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ) or in the transition phase between GCQ and the New Normal.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Hindi para sa lahat ang face-to-face classes, [dahil] meron tayong standards. Hindi lahat ay pinipilit mag-[limited] face-to-face classes. Apat na agency ang magde-decide kung papayagan ba. Sa Metro Manila, medyo may kahirapan   [mag-conduct ng limited face-to-face classes]. Kasi GCQ ngayon sa Metro Manila. Although ang mga international schools, sabi nila, kaya nila ‘yong mga requirements ng departamento at ng IATF. Pero, sabi namin, kailangang inspeksiyunin namin ‘yong facility nila.” Secretary Briones said.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Education chief emphasized that decisions to allow limited, localized face-to-face classes will be made with due coordination between DepEd, the LGUs concerned, and the local health authorities.
</p><p>
</p><p>According to Briones, limited face-to-face classes will still be strictly regulated with the priority on the health and safety of learners, teachers, and personnel following stringent health measures such as the following:
</p><p>
</p><p>No mask, no entry policy in school premises;
</p><p>Hand washing and hand hygiene;
</p><p>Regular disinfection in school premises;
</p><p>Checking for temperature and respiratory symptoms;
</p><p>Reduction in class size to 15 to 20 maximum, and physical arrangement of seats conforming to required distances;
</p><p>Intermittent attendance to school only, to complement distance learning;
</p><p>Controls of flow of learners and personnel in entrance and exit;
</p><p>No mass gatherings;
</p><p>Visible instructions, signages and markings; and
</p><p>Preparedness and case management system in coordination with LGUs and local health for contact tracing, testing, isolation and treatment.
</p><p>In addition, host local government unit must be ready to support financially as well as in other ways the requirements for limited face to face learning.
</p><p>
</p><p>A small number of private schools which have started limited face-to-face classes last June will be allowed to continue however.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>School reopening for face-to-face interactions must be carefully planned to ensure the safety of students as well as teachers and school staff in a staged fashion especially in following physical distancing. Planning and execution of school health protocols during this pandemic must be supported by the truthful data being given by various institutions. WHO cited that ‘The checklist is aligned with, and builds upon, existing COVID-19-related WHO guidelines and is structured around protective measures related to: 1) hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette; 2) physical distancing; 3) use of masks in schools; 4) environmental cleaning and ventilation; and 5) respecting procedures for isolation of all people with symptoms.’10 The checklist helps policymakers and school officials to enhance compliance and adherence to public health protocols in the time of the pandemic.10</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, school health protocols in conducting face-to-face classes must be planned carefully following national and international guidelines to ensure that students will be safe or at least mitigate the effects of COVID-19. After all, students’ lives matter as education does to them. That is the responsibility of every government to ensure its fulfillment.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Face-to-face<p>I agree about the opening of limited Face-to-face classes because learning is superior to online learning since "in-person communications make our brains happier," according to Stanford researchers. In a classroom setting, <strong>teachers </strong>can better control their themes because they are no longer compressed to suit the modules. Face-to-face learning allows pupils to cultivate and thrive in a safe environment. It's different when a teacher is there with students. It involves the pupils' mental and emotional well-being. Being at school is never dull.  <strong>Teachers </strong>are faced with the difficulty of having to condense and simplify their themes in order to fit into the modules. The topics in the modules are challenging for students to internalize. <strong>Teachers </strong>can effectively control their themes in a classroom<strong> </strong>context. The exclusion of some of the topics is not a concern.</p><p></p>What are Face-to-face classes?<p>•	Face-to-face mastering is an academic technique wherein a set of students is taught direction content and mastering the material in person. This lets a learner and a teacher have interaction in actual time. It is the most common technique of educational instruction.</p><p>•	Traditional classroom studying is part of face-to-face education. Students who attend a face-to-face studying institute are required to wait periods each day. Classes vary from early morning through the past due afternoon.</p><p></p>Advantages of face-to-face classes<p>1.	In class, the instructor provides study notes, and you can take additional notes to help you pass your tests.</p><p>2.	With your peers, you can exchange and compare notes.</p><p>3.	Your questions are answered in real-time, so you don't have to wait for a response from the instructor.</p><p>4.	The professor may highlight key passages of the textbook to assist you in studying for your exams.</p><p>5.	You will not be responsible for creating your own timetable. The institute will provide you with a schedule that includes your class dates and timings.</p><p></p><p>Online class or face-to face class? https://brainly.ph/question/26419830</p><p>When face-to-face classes resume, what would be the first thing you would do? https://brainly.ph/question/19676306</p><p>What is your stand about the face to face classes on the secondary schools https://brainly.ph/question/24496581</p><p><strong>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Face -to-face.

                            11. argumentative essay for conduct of limited face to face classes in the time of pandemic​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>The novel coronavirus pandemic has disrupted life as we know it. In the face of this global health crisis, many educational institutions have had to pivot to online learning to protect the safety of their students, staff, and faculty. However, some argue that online learning is not an effective substitute for in-person instruction and that schools should instead be focusing on ways to conduct limited face-to-face classes safely.</p><p></p><p>There are a few key reasons why face-to-face classes are important. First, they provide students with an opportunity to interact with their peers and mentors in a way that is not possible online. Second, face-to-face classes allow for more immediate feedback and collaboration between students and instructors. And finally, research has shown that face-to-face instruction is generally more effective than online instruction, particularly for certain subject areas such as math and science.</p><p></p><p>Despite these advantages, there are also some significant risks associated with conducting face-to-face classes during a pandemic. The most obvious risk is the potential for virus transmission. However, there are also risks associated with the increased stress and anxiety that come with having to worry about contracting the virus. In addition, face-to-face classes can place a strain on already overburdened healthcare systems.</p><p></p><p>Given the risks and benefits of conducting face-to-face classes during a pandemic, educational institutions must carefully weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. There is no easy answer, and each situation is unique. However, what is clear is that any decision should be based on the best available science and the needs of the students, staff, and faculty.</p><p></p><br />
