                                            Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if it is specific.10. The world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change, according to a report Monday, April 4, by the UN climate science panel. 11. The report justifies the growing concern among scientists, activists, and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius - the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control. 12. "In order to meet these targets, you need credible commitments on public policy, private investment, innovation, all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades," said John Bistline, a climate expert for the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute and a contributing author to the IPCC report. 13. To keep warming in check, global consumption of coal, for example, must drop by at least 67% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, while oil and gas use must also decline sharply, according to the report. That would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and cancelling new construction. 14."Without early retirements, or reductions in utilization, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C," the report said. 15.The report said that the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Our development in human transportation has gone far and wide across the whole world as it reaches from land transportation all the way to interstellar travels, though this is a huge development in our society today there are risks countering to it's benefits. Transportation is very important in our society especially in the rough times now in this pandemic to have a safe way to travel however the risks and problems to this are pollution and lack of human excercise, the reason I said these are risks from human transportation is because almost all our vehicles run on gas and they just destroy our environment and our health thanks to this gas and the lack of human excercise is because some people become too relying on these transportation that they begin to get lazy and then their body wont function the way it used to now having the difficulty of moving your body and the development of more body mass. </p><p></p><p>Sorry if it is too long you can edit this if you need to and I hope it helps</p><br />

                            10. Read the statements below. Write G if the information is general. Write S if it is specific.10. The world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change, according to a report Monday, April 4, by the UN climate science panel. 11. The report justifies the growing concern among scientists, activists, and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius - the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control. 12. "In order to meet these targets, you need credible commitments on public policy, private investment, innovation, all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades," said John Bistline, a climate expert for the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute and a contributing author to the IPCC report. 13. To keep warming in check, global consumption of coal, for example, must drop by at least 67% by 2030 and 95% by 2050, while oil and gas use must also decline sharply, according to the report. That would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and cancelling new construction. 14."Without early retirements, or reductions in utilization, the current fossil infrastructure will emit more GHGs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C," the report said. 15.The report said that the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale.​</h2><br />
