Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.
Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was
reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a
time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually
harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been
higher.
The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we
need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the
middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.
It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and
Republicans can work together right away.
First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster
and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So
we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay
better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we
should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult
as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.
Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America
that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would
secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The
majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.
Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable
children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term
certainty they deserve.
We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places
where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like
compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t
govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just
hurting the people we were sent here to serve.
Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from
different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans,
to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.

                                            Learning Task 2: Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table. Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility - we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow - education, infrastructure, research - we should cut what we don't need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs. This shouldn't be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking - not growing. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don't think it's good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don't like compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn't governing - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we're Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love. Thanks everybody and have a great weekend. Point/Claim Evidences Type of Evidence​</a>

Depending on the country, education may be more-or-less affordable; forexample, in Denmark it is free, whereas in the United States, students have to takeout enormous loans to pay for a college or university, which they then have to payoff throughout many years.At the same time, going to a higher education institution is not the only optionone has nowadays.

This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.

                        Education should be free because it is a right everybody has, but since it isn't, more and more kids don't get their rights to have their education because of financial problems, even though they want to. <br />Because education can be the key.  Key to success, innovation, avoid poverty, avoid ignorance and the key for better future(for our dreams).  Not everyone can afford education.  Imagine if it will be free.

                            5. Learning Task 3
Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.
Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was
reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.
There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a
time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually
harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been
higher.
The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we
need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the
middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.
It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and
Republicans can work together right away.
First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster
and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So
we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay
better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we
should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult
as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.
Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America
that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would
secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The
majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.
Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable
children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term
certainty they deserve.
We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places
where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like
compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t
govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just
hurting the people we were sent here to serve.
Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from
different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans,
to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.

                            10. Learning Task 2: Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table. Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility - we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow - education, infrastructure, research - we should cut what we don't need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs. This shouldn't be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking - not growing. Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. Third, we should pass a farm bill - one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve. We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don't think it's good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don't like compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn't governing - it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve. Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we're Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love. Thanks everybody and have a great weekend. Point/Claim Evidences Type of Evidence​</h2><br />

                            21. Learning Task 3Read the speech of the former President Barack Obama carefully. Then, analyze the evidence using the given table.Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.There has been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it is understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.Thanks everybody and have a great weekendIV.
