I am confident to say that the family nerves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. It's my belief that the basic knowledge about one's culture and identity comes from the family only. I know you will have to agree that that we are a reflection of our family. In my experience, we learn to socialize through our families only and develop our intellect. From my own point of view, people who live with their families tend to be happier than ones living alone. Definitely, all the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from his family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which has made me a better person. For me, they are my first teachers and my first friends.. I will always be grateful to my family for all they have done for me. It seems to me that my life is empty without them. 1:____________________2:___________________3:___________________4:___________________5:___________________6;___________________7:_________________8:_________________9:_________________10:_________________​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Familial culture is how you express culture as a family through traditions, roles, beliefs, and other areas. Many aspects can influence a family culture such as religion, and the community around you. Religion can strongly influence family culture, which can be demonstrated by the Catholic religion in many Hispanic countries. Most Hispanic cultures practice Catholic beliefs and within a family these beliefs are practiced to different degrees. For example, one family may go to the catholic mass every week while some may only go once a month. This can all depend on the standards and cultural norms for a given community. Every family is different, and every family has its own culture.</p><br />
