                                            Filipino sa Piling Larangan: Tech-Voc
1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The song is about finding yourself, finding yourself until you know God. He introduced yourself and gave meaning to your life here on earth. The song is about finding yourself through God.</p><p></p><p>This implies that you cannot know and find yourself if there is no God in your life. You do not know why you live and what your purpose as a person when you do not know God. In our lives we need to know God before we can know the meaning of our lives.</p><p>(Of course you will know and appreciate your purpose on earth when you are a Christian)</p><p></p><p>You feel worthless in the world when there is no God in our lives.</p><p></p><p>He is the only one who is there for you when you feel hopeless, he is the one by your side every time you feel so empty. He is the one who takes care of you when you are hurt, he is the one who is there when you are in the dark. He is the hope.</p><p></p><p>Sorry, ito lang ako, paki ayos nalang po or magdagdag ka ng opinion mo kung paano mo naintindihan at naramdaman yung song awieee. Thanks. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> my teaching philosophy is to be passionate, enthusiastic, and engaging every time that I give a lecture so students are excited to learn more about the topic and become active learners. I don’t try to be the favorite teacher. Instead, I want to help the students to become self-sufficient, as scientists and physicians at the forefront of the field for the next half-century. I am most proud when I can make a positive difference in someone’s academic career and see the amazing accomplishments of those whom I have mentored. I truly believe that the future is in the hands of the students we lead toward careers as scientists and physicians. While in research we are only as good as our last experiment, the students we mentor and their future students are a legacy that will endure. Finally, Henry Ford once said, “anyone who stops learning is old, whether at age 20 or 80”. I truly believe learning is a lifelong process and my role as an educator is to instill lifelong learning in all my students</p><br />
