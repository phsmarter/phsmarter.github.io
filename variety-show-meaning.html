                                            Reality TV shows are good entertainment Reality shows are a very popular forma di entertainment on TV sodass These are dozens of different types of programmes such as gng contests. cooking competitions or going to live in the jungle. about Firstly, I think that there is a lot of variety in reality TV. People at home can choose which types of programme they want to watch depending on what they are interested in. Some people like watching, singang, or cooking competitions while others prefer watching programmes building houses or travelling around the world. In addition, reality TV programmes are a great opportunity to discover talented singers, dancers, or chefs. Several people who take part in these programmes get jobs as a results being on TV. Another advantage is that the people on the shows have interesting experiences and meet new people. On the other hand, some people think that reality TV is an easy way for them to become famous. However, most succesful singers, actors or chefs have worked hard all their lives and are good at their job because of their bardwork. Also, sometimes the people on the shows have to do really difficult or dangerous things. The competitions are very hard and there is only one winner. Another disadvantage is that some programmes always follow the same format and this can be boring to watch. To sum up, I think that reality TV is a good entertainment. There is a lot of variety which means there is something for everyone and they are interesting to watch. What is being talked about in the text? Do you agree/disagree with this?

Reality TV shows are good entertainment Reality shows are a very popular forma di entertainment on TV sodass These are dozens of different types of programmes such as gng contests. cooking competitions or going to live in the jungle. about Firstly, I think that there is a lot of variety in reality TV. People at home can choose which types of programme they want to watch depending on what they are interested in. Some people like watching, singang, or cooking competitions while others prefer watching programmes building houses or travelling around the world. In addition, reality TV programmes are a great opportunity to discover talented singers, dancers, or chefs. Several people who take part in these programmes get jobs as a results being on TV. Another advantage is that the people on the shows have interesting experiences and meet new people. On the other hand, some people think that reality TV is an easy way for them to become famous. However, most succesful singers, actors or chefs have worked hard all their lives and are good at their job because of their bardwork. Also, sometimes the people on the shows have to do really difficult or dangerous things. The competitions are very hard and there is only one winner. Another disadvantage is that some programmes always follow the same format and this can be boring to watch. To sum up, I think that reality TV is a good entertainment. There is a lot of variety which means there is something for everyone and they are interesting to watch. What is being talked about in the text? Do you agree/disagree with this?
