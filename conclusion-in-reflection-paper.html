                        Introduction:    <br />   The Philippine society confronts formidable longer-term economic problems. The exhaustion of the land frontier suitable for production of present crops under existing <br />techniques, which is compounded by degradation of the environment by wasteful harvesting of forestry  resources and over-exploitation of inshore fisheries is an obvious problem. A comparable problem arises in the inertia built into the age structure of the Philippine population. <br /><br />Body:<br />In 1970, those under 15 years of age accounted for 45.6 per cent of all Filipinos and estimated population growth in the 1970s was 2.7 per cent, a rate more than double the “zero-growth rate”. <br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If the growth rate should fall to the “zero-growth rate” tomorrow, the Philippine population would continue to grow for the better part of a century and would virtually double as cohorts of Filipinos entering the reproductive age group would continue to increase for many years.<br />

                        <strong>Reaction Paper on Terra X: Wonderful World of Chemistry, The Building Blocks of Nature</strong><strong>Introduction</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>A fantastic magic show is chemistry. Dr. Mai-Thi Nguyen-Kim is passionate about it. She leads the Terra X viewers on an exploration of the development of science. Everything seems a little unusual, but in the end, it's not that much stranger than all the <strong>different kinds of chemistry that have been forming our world ever since the Big Bang.</strong></p><p></p><strong>Body</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>Since the dawn of time,<strong> people have been curious in the composition of the universe. </strong>The early alchemists were encouraged to practice such a transformative skill since solids could turn into liquids and liquids into gases. The philosopher's stone which could turn base metals into gold, was the main goal of their hunt. Even if all of the attempts were unsuccessful, many ineffective strategies produced crucial insights. </p><p></p><p><strong>Utilizing nature's building blocks to produce wholly new substances is another aspect of chemistry.</strong> It allows for the combination of elements and molecules that, in the absence of clever laboratory technology, would never have been possible. It was one of the pioneers of contemporary applied chemistry. </p><p></p><p><strong>He experimented with fertilizers for farming and created extracts for baby food and seasonings. </strong>And he was one of the pioneers in the effort to make chemistry approachable for a broad audience. His show lectures have become a legend. Students and famous people from their era couldn't stop wondering at how powerfully it thumped, buffered, and smoked.</p><p></p><strong>Conclusion</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>Therefore, a living lab is the human body. <strong>Because chemical reactions are constantly happening inside of us. </strong>The building blocks of life can be found throughout the cosmos. Stardust is the source of everything on earth. The sequence of events allowed life to emerge from chemical building blocks here of all places. </p><p></p><p>We may also be able to determine just how amazing it is that we breathe and live on this planet. If we eventually understand what precisely it takes for life to emerge from lifeless chemical building blocks. Consequently,<strong> we can presume that there is more living out there. </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Chemistry and Its types:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2508748</p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Jack London's short story "The Law of Life" was published in 1901 and has since been considered a masterpiece of naturalism literature. The story is set in Yukon, a remote land where the winter is long and harsh. The story centers around an old man named Koskoosh, who is left to die in the snow by his tribe due to a tribal law. Throughout the story, London uses vivid imagery to show the harshness of the natural world and the inevitability of death.</p><p></p><p>Summary:</p><p></p><p>"The Law of Life" tells the story of an old man named Koskoosh, who is abandoned by his tribe in the snow to die. The tribe's law is that anyone who is no longer able to contribute to the tribe should be left to die. Koskoosh is left alone in the snow and must come to terms with his inevitable death. The story shows Koskoosh's final moments and his reflection on his long life.</p><p></p><p>Personal Reflection:</p><p></p><p>Reading "The Law of Life" gave me a new perspective on the inevitability of death. The story shows how the natural world can be harsh and unforgiving, and how death is a part of life. It also highlights the importance of community and the role of the tribe in determining the fate of an individual. As someone who lives in a society where the individual is valued above all else, it was interesting to see the role of the tribe in a different culture.</p><p></p><p>Critical Analysis:</p><p></p><p>Jack London's use of vivid imagery in "The Law of Life" helps to create a sense of the harshness of the natural world. The story also explores themes of life and death, and the importance of community. Additionally, it raises questions about the morality of abandoning the old and the weak. While the story is set in a different time and culture, its themes are universal and relevant to contemporary society.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "The Law of Life" is a powerful short story that explores themes of life and death, community, and morality. London's vivid imagery and well-crafted characters help to create a memorable reading experience. The story prompts the reader to reflect on the inevitability of death and the role of community in determining an individual's fate. Overall, "The Law of Life" is a classic work of naturalism literature that continues to resonate with readers today.</p><br />
