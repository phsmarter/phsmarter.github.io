The two are very lovely, sweet and cute. They kiss and waggletheir tails every time Conching either goes out or comes home.One day, Conching came home looking sad and very anxious. Shecalled Potchi and Chichi, talked to them as if the two understood her well. Sherevealed to them series of challenges that she is facing at the moment.

A Woodcutter was hard at work beside a river. He chopped down a tree and chopped off the branches, one by one. He stacked the small branches in one pile and the large branches in another pile. It was hard work, and he grew tired. By accident, he dropped his axe into the deep river. He sat down on the river bank, and put his his head in his hands. The Woodcutter heard a sound in the nearby bushes. He lifted his head and was amazed to see a strange little man dressed all in green. He thought perhaps it was one of the Wood Gnomes of the fairy tales, and he was quite correct. "Why are you so upset?" asked the Wood Gnome. The Woodcutter explained what had happened, and the Wood Gnome walked closer to the bank of the deep river and dived right in headfirst. In moments he climbed out, carrying a golden axe. "Is this your axe, sir?" asked the Wood Gnome. The Woodcutter shook his head with sorrow. The Wood Gnome dived back into the river, and came up with a silver axe. "Is this your axe?" he asked.

Indeed, light, its retreat and approach, its highs and ebbs, is a central motif throughout the story and one which must be watched closely. Light is associated with all the things Lazaro no longer believes in. One, it is associated with faith, Mrs. Lazaro had resumed her knitting; in the circle of yellow light, her head bowed, she seemed absorbed in some contemplative prayer... He hurried down the carving stairs, under the votive lamps of the Sacred Heart. Two, light is also associated with those he loves but is distant from, notably Ben, his son, In the glow of the dashboard lights, the boy's face relaxed, smiled. Third, light is finally also associated with life itself. Their final stop before heading to the hut where the death of the baby waits is a gas station, its fluorescent lights the only brightness on the plain before them, on the road that led farther into deeper darkness. This is the final outpost, bathed in light, before they enter death's realm and administer to a baby Lazaro knows he cannot save. (The descent towards darkness and death is further seen in their crossing of a river, to drown here in the depths of the night before they reach the hut - an allusion to the River Styx.) Once they reach Esteban's hut, darkness is well and truly entrenched; so much so that even light can only be described in relation to darkness, 'We're here doctor,' Esteban said, and they padded up a stretch of sand to a clump of trees; a dog started to bark, the shadows of a kerosene lamp wavered at a window. The preponderance of darkness, and the linking of existential themes to light (themes which Lazaro yearns for but can no longer believe in), illustrates that Lazaro is a damaged man; scarred irrevocably by his work (duty had taken the place of an exhausted compassion) and the loss of his first son (He closed his eyes, erasing the slashed wrists, part of the future dead in a boarding-house room... Sorrow lay in ambush among the years.). That Lazarus is damaged is aptly seen in the darkness surrounding him. He thought of light years, black space, and infinite distances; in the unmeasured universe, man's life flared briefly and was gone, traceless in the void. But can there be a resurrection? After all the character's name harkens to the biblical Lazarus who was literally raised out of darkness. There are encouraging signs as the short story progresses that Lazaro tentatively takes some steps towards the light, ie. he begins to believe again in faith, hope and love. The catalyst for this spark of belief is Ben, his last son, He could sense the boy groping for the tremendous answers... a woman bathed in light appeared before children, and mortal men spoke of eternal life... With unaccustomed tenderness he placed a hand on Ben's shoulder as they turned toward the cement-walled house. Lazaro comes close. But just as Ben tries to articulate all the light his father has lost, of faith and hope, the light becomes too strong and blind Lazarus. This is literally seen in the story for just as Lazarus again yearns to believe, A bus roared around a hill toward them, its lights blinding him. Lazaro falls back into darkness and is denied the light. Instead of faith, hope and love he is consigned back to his tomb of death and dirt. In the headlights the dust sifted down and when the air was clear again, Dr. Lazaro, swallowing a taste of earth, of darkness, maneuvered the car back onto the road, his arms numb and exhausted. There is no resurrection for this story's Lazarus. POINTS The darkness though does not make Lazaro an evil man. He is simply tired, a character who has seen too much and who, like Job, asks what did man do to deserve this lot. The sparrow does not fall without the Father's leave, he mused at the sky, but it falls just the same. But to what end are the sufferings of a child? And again like Job, Lazarus has the temerity to insist that is wrong and to ask the only question there is to ask; why?

adapted from The Man Who Died
by John Buchan
1 I returned from the City about three o'clock on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in the Old Country, and was fed up with it. If anyone had told me a year ago that I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; but there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick. I couldn't get enough exercise, and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-water that has been standing in the sun. Richard Hannay, I kept telling myself, you have got into the wrong ditch, my friend, and you had better climb out.
2 From the first I was disappointed with the place. In about a week I was tired of seeing sights, and in less than a month I had had enough of restaurants and theaters. I had no real pal to go about with, which probably explains things. Here was I, thirty-seven years old, sound in wind and limb, with enough money to have a good time, yawning my head off all day. I had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld, for I was the best bored man in the United Kingdom.
3 I was just fitting my key into the door when I noticed a man at my elbow. I had not seen him approach, and the sudden appearance made me start. He was a slim man, with a short brown beard and small, blue eyes. I recognized him as the occupant of a flat1 on the top floor, with whom I had passed the time of day on the stairs.
4 "Can I speak to you?" he said. "May I come in for a minute?" He was steadying his voice with an effort, and his hand was pawing my arm.
5 I got my door open and motioned him in. No sooner was he over the threshold than he made a dash for my back room. Then he bolted back.
6 "Is the door locked?" he asked feverishly, and he fastened the chain with his own hand.
7 "I'm very sorry," he said humbly. "It's a mighty liberty, but you looked the kind of man who would understand. I've had you in my mind all this week when things got troublesome. Say, will you do me a good turn?"
8 "I'll listen to you," I said. "That's all I'll promise." I was getting worried by the antics of this nervous little chap.
9 There was a tray of coffee on a table beside him, from which he filled himself a cup. He drank it off in three gulps, and cracked the cup as he set it down.
10 "Pardon," he said, "I'm a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at this moment to be dead."
11 "What does it feel like?" I asked. I was pretty certain that I had to deal with a madman.
12 A smile flickered over his drawn face. "I'm not mad—yet. I'm going to confide in you. I need help worse than any man ever needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in."
13 "Get on with your yarn," I said, "and I'll tell you."
14 He was an American, from Kentucky, and after college, being pretty well off, he had started out to see the world. He wrote a bit, and acted as war correspondent for a Chicago paper, and spent a year or two in South-Eastern Europe. I gathered that he was a fine linguist, and had got to know pretty well the society in those parts. He spoke familiarly of many names that I remembered to have seen in the newspapers.
15 He had played about with politics, he told me, at first for the interest of them, and then because he couldn't help himself. I read him as a sharp, restless fellow, who always wanted to get down to the roots of things. He got a little further down than he wanted.

It is here that loose ends are tied up, conflicts are concluded, outcomes are revealed, and a happy or sad ending takes place. As many of the final actions have already taken place, this part of the plot can be made up of just a summary of where the main character will end up in the future, instead of including any more active events, ___2. It is where the basic characters and plot elements such as settings are revealed. In most cases the major conflict of the story, novel or script is also hinted at in this element, though smaller conflicts in the plot may be introduced later. In a shorter work, the introduction happens within the first few paragraphs, while in a longer work such as a novel it will happen within the first few chapters. ___3. This part of the plot includes events that will help to fully resolve the conflict. The results of actions that the main character has taken are presented as well as the results of decisions that have been made, whether good or bad for the character. ___4. This is the turning point of the story, novel, or script. It is the moment where it seems like the main character is in danger or could even possibly fail at resolving the conflict. Depending on the kind of conflict being faced, (man vs man, man vs self, and others) the actions at this point in the work can be either physical or mental.___5. This is also part of the story where problem or conflict is truly introduced. The main characters have been established and events begin to get complicated for them. They may take actions against the conflict though it will probably not be solved yet. This element of the plot is where excitement, tension and crisis are encountered.​</a>

                                            Activity 4.2 Instructions. Read the summary of the story below and answer the question that follows. (20 points) There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to get as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it tumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired blowing, the bamboo tree stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet," the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well - lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope." The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives up, no matter how hard life was before and even now... the FILIPINO remains to be PLIANT like the Bamboo..1. What is the Filipino positive characteristics describe in the selection? 2.

Text #1 It is physically impossible for a well-educated, intellectual, or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts just as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them. All healthy people like their dinners, but their dinner is not the main object of their lives. So all healthy minded people like making money ought to like it and enjoy the sensation of winning it; it is something better than money. A good soldier, for instance, mainly wishes to do his fighting well. He is glad of his pay-very properly so and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it-till, his main mission of life is to win battles, not to be paid for winning them. So of clergymen. The clergyman's object is essentially baptize and preach not to be paid for preaching. So of doctors. They like fees no doubt-ought to like them; yet if they are brave and well-educated the entire object to their lives is not fees. They on the whole, desire to cure the sick; and if they are good doctors and 26 Summary a Precis and the choice were fairly to them, would rather cure their patient and lose their fee than kill him and get it. And so with all the other brave and rightly trained men: their work is first, their fee second-very important always; but still second.  Text #2 Home is the young, who known "nothing of the world and who would be forlorn and sad, if thrown upon it. It is providential, shelter of the weak and inexperienced, who have to learn as yet to cope with the temptations which lies outside of it. It is the place of training of those who are not only ignorant, but have no yet learnt how to learn, and who have to be taught by careful individual trail, how to set about profiting by the lessons of teacher. And it is the school of elementary studies-not of advances, for such studies alone can make master minds. Moreover, it is the shrine of our best affections, the bosom of our fondest recollections, at spell upon our after life, a stay for world weary mind and soul; wherever we are, till the end comes. Such are attributes or offices of home, and like to these, in one or other sense or measure, are the attributes and offices of a college in a university.  Text #3 Teaching is the noblest of professions. A teacher has a sacred duty to perform. It is he on whom rests the responsibility of moulding the character of young children. Apart from developing their intellect, he can inculcate in them qualities of good citizenship, remaining neat and clean, talking decently and sitting properly. These virtues are not easy to be imbibed. Only he who himself leads a life of simplicity, purity and rigid discipline can successfully cultivate these habits in his pupils. Besides a teacher always remain young. He may grow old in age, but not in spite. Perpetual contact with budding youths keeps him happy and cheerful. There are moments when domestic worries weigh heavily on his mind, but the delightful company of innocent children makes him overcome his transient moods of despair. ​</a>

A poem is a work of literature that uses language to evoke emotions and imagery in a condensed and rhythmic form. A drama is a work of literature that is meant to be performed, typically on stage, and includes dialogue and stage directions. An essay is a work of non-fiction that presents an argument or explores a topic in an organized and structured format.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Old Man at the Bridge" is a short story written by Ernest Hemingway. It is set during the Spanish Civil War and revolves around an old man who is forced to leave his home due to the war. As he sits by the side of the road, he is discovered by a soldier who stops to talk to him. The old man tells the soldier about his situation and expresses his fear that he will not be able to make it to safety before the enemy arrives.</p><p></p><p>The story's characters include the old man, who is described as "emaciated" and "frightened," and the soldier, who is kind and sympathetic towards the old man.

The central conflict is the old man's fear of not being able to reach safety before the enemy arrives.</p><p></p><p>The theme of the story is the fragility of life and the human experience of facing death. The story reveals a significant truth about life in that even the most seemingly insignificant individuals have their own stories and fears, and that the inevitability of death makes all lives equally important.</p><p></p><p>One of the characters' observations that rings true is the soldier's comment that "War is not won by evacuation." This statement highlights the fact that war is not just about military strategy and victory, but also about the impact it has on individuals and their lives.</p><p></p><p>The old man is a complex character, as he is not just a representative of the war's civilian casualties, but also a symbol of the human experience of facing mortality and the fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>A short story is a work of fiction that is typically shorter than a novel, with a focused plot and limited number of characters. It differs from a poem in that it is prose rather than verse, and from a drama in that it is not intended to be performed. An essay is a nonfiction work that explores a topic or idea, typically in a more structured and analytical format than a short story</p><br />

                            7. As you read this story, look for the main idea of each paragraph. These can be put together to make a summary of the whole story. A Woodcutter was hard at work beside a river. He chopped down a tree and chopped off the branches, one by one. He stacked the small branches in one pile and the large branches in another pile. It was hard work, and he grew tired. By accident, he dropped his axe into the deep river. He sat down on the river bank, and put his his head in his hands. The Woodcutter heard a sound in the nearby bushes. He lifted his head and was amazed to see a strange little man dressed all in green. He thought perhaps it was one of the Wood Gnomes of the fairy tales, and he was quite correct. "Why are you so upset?" asked the Wood Gnome. The Woodcutter explained what had happened, and the Wood Gnome walked closer to the bank of the deep river and dived right in headfirst. In moments he climbed out, carrying a golden axe. "Is this your axe, sir?" asked the Wood Gnome. The Woodcutter shook his head with sorrow. The Wood Gnome dived back into the river, and came up with a silver axe. "Is this your axe?" he asked. Again, the woodcutter shook his head, and again the Wood Gnome dived into the river. This time, the Wood Gnome came out of the river with the Woodcutter's own axe, and the Woodcutter shouted out with joy. The Wood Gnome told the Woodcutter that he must keep the gold and silver axes as well as his own, as a reward for his honesty. The Woodcutter went home and told all of his friends what had happened, and showed them the gold and silver axes. The next day, one of those friends went to the place by the river that the Woodcutter had described. He threw his axe into the river, and sat down on the riverbank and cried. The Wood Gnome appeared, and asked the man why he was crying. The man said that he had dropped his axe into the river by mistake, and the Wood Gnome quickly dived into the river, and came up with a golden axe. "Is this your axe?" the Wood Gnome asked, and the man reached for it greedily, saying that it was the very axe he had lost. The Wood Gnome kept the golden axe, and left without going back into the river for the axe that the dishonest man had thrown there on purpose.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The title of the story is "The Woodcutter and the Wood Gnome." The main idea of the story is that honesty is always rewarded. The woodcutter is rewarded with two golden axes for being honest about losing his axe in the river. The dishonest man is not rewarded and is left without his axe. The story also teaches that it is better to be honest and have nothing than to be dishonest and have something. </p><p></p><p>The story begins with a woodcutter chopping down a tree and stacking the branches in two piles. He accidentally drops his axe into the river and sits down on the bank, feeling upset. Suddenly, a strange little man dressed all in green appears and asks the woodcutter why he is upset. The woodcutter explains that he lost his axe in the river. The little man, who is actually a wood gnome, dives into the river and comes up with a golden axe. He asks the woodcutter if it is his axe, but the woodcutter says no. The wood gnome dives back into the river and comes up with a silver axe. Again, he asks the woodcutter if it is his axe, but the woodcutter says no. The wood gnome dives into the river a third time and comes up with the woodcutter's own axe. The woodcutter is overjoyed and thanks the wood gnome. The wood gnome tells the woodcutter that he must keep the two golden axes as a reward for his honesty. </p><p></p><p>The woodcutter goes home and tells his friends what happened. The next day, one of his friends goes to the river and pretends to accidentally drop his axe into the river. He sits down on the bank and cries, and the wood gnome appears. The man says that he lost his axe in the river and the wood gnome dives in and comes up with a golden axe. The man grabs the axe and runs away, without even thanking the wood gnome. The wood gnome does not give chase and simply lets the man keep the golden axe.</p><p></p><p>The moral of the story is that honesty is always rewarded. The woodcutter is an honest man and is rewarded with two golden axes. The dishonest man is not rewarded and is left without his axe.</p><p></p><p>This story also teaches that it is better to be honest and have nothing than to be dishonest and have something. The woodcutter is honest and loses his axe, but he is still better off than the dishonest man who pretends to lose his axe. The dishonest man gets a golden axe, but he is left without his original axe and he does not have the respect of the wood gnome.</p><p></p><p>The story ends with the woodcutter being rewarded for his honesty and the dishonest man being punished for his dishonesty.</p><br />

You will get 1pt.each for both challenge and strength/ weakness. Summary of “FAITH, LOVE, TIME AND DR. LAZARO” By: Gregorio Brillantes Lazaro is a pool of darkness surrounded by light. Indeed, light, its retreat and approach, its highs and ebbs, is a central motif throughout the story and one which must be watched closely. Light is associated with all the things Lazaro no longer believes in. One, it is associated with faith, Mrs. Lazaro had resumed her knitting; in the circle of yellow light, her head bowed, she seemed absorbed in some contemplative prayer... He hurried down the carving stairs, under the votive lamps of the Sacred Heart. Two, light is also associated with those he loves but is distant from, notably Ben, his son, In the glow of the dashboard lights, the boy's face relaxed, smiled. Third, light is finally also associated with life itself. Their final stop before heading to the hut where the death of the baby waits is a gas station, its fluorescent lights the only brightness on the plain before them, on the road that led farther into deeper darkness. This is the final outpost, bathed in light, before they enter death's realm and administer to a baby Lazaro knows he cannot save. (The descent towards darkness and death is further seen in their crossing of a river, to drown here in the depths of the night before they reach the hut - an allusion to the River Styx.) Once they reach Esteban's hut, darkness is well and truly entrenched; so much so that even light can only be described in relation to darkness, 'We're here doctor,' Esteban said, and they padded up a stretch of sand to a clump of trees; a dog started to bark, the shadows of a kerosene lamp wavered at a window. The preponderance of darkness, and the linking of existential themes to light (themes which Lazaro yearns for but can no longer believe in), illustrates that Lazaro is a damaged man; scarred irrevocably by his work (duty had taken the place of an exhausted compassion) and the loss of his first son (He closed his eyes, erasing the slashed wrists, part of the future dead in a boarding-house room... Sorrow lay in ambush among the years.). That Lazarus is damaged is aptly seen in the darkness surrounding him. He thought of light years, black space, and infinite distances; in the unmeasured universe, man's life flared briefly and was gone, traceless in the void. But can there be a resurrection? After all the character's name harkens to the biblical Lazarus who was literally raised out of darkness. There are encouraging signs as the short story progresses that Lazaro tentatively takes some steps towards the light, ie. he begins to believe again in faith, hope and love. The catalyst for this spark of belief is Ben, his last son, He could sense the boy groping for the tremendous answers... a woman bathed in light appeared before children, and mortal men spoke of eternal life... With unaccustomed tenderness he placed a hand on Ben's shoulder as they turned toward the cement-walled house. Lazaro comes close. But just as Ben tries to articulate all the light his father has lost, of faith and hope, the light becomes too strong and blind Lazarus. This is literally seen in the story for just as Lazarus again yearns to believe, A bus roared around a hill toward them, its lights blinding him. Lazaro falls back into darkness and is denied the light. Instead of faith, hope and love he is consigned back to his tomb of death and dirt. In the headlights the dust sifted down and when the air was clear again, Dr. Lazaro, swallowing a taste of earth, of darkness, maneuvered the car back onto the road, his arms numb and exhausted. There is no resurrection for this story's Lazarus. POINTS The darkness though does not make Lazaro an evil man. He is simply tired, a character who has seen too much and who, like Job, asks what did man do to deserve this lot. The sparrow does not fall without the Father's leave, he mused at the sky, but it falls just the same. But to what end are the sufferings of a child? And again like Job, Lazarus has the temerity to insist that is wrong and to ask the only question there is to ask; why?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

adapted from The Man Who Died
by John Buchan
1 I returned from the City about three o'clock on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in the Old Country, and was fed up with it. If anyone had told me a year ago that I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; but there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick. I couldn't get enough exercise, and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-water that has been standing in the sun. Richard Hannay, I kept telling myself, you have got into the wrong ditch, my friend, and you had better climb out.
2 From the first I was disappointed with the place. In about a week I was tired of seeing sights, and in less than a month I had had enough of restaurants and theaters. I had no real pal to go about with, which probably explains things. Here was I, thirty-seven years old, sound in wind and limb, with enough money to have a good time, yawning my head off all day. I had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld, for I was the best bored man in the United Kingdom.
3 I was just fitting my key into the door when I noticed a man at my elbow. I had not seen him approach, and the sudden appearance made me start. He was a slim man, with a short brown beard and small, blue eyes. I recognized him as the occupant of a flat1 on the top floor, with whom I had passed the time of day on the stairs.
4 "Can I speak to you?" he said. "May I come in for a minute?" He was steadying his voice with an effort, and his hand was pawing my arm.
5 I got my door open and motioned him in. No sooner was he over the threshold than he made a dash for my back room. Then he bolted back.
6 "Is the door locked?" he asked feverishly, and he fastened the chain with his own hand.
7 "I'm very sorry," he said humbly. "It's a mighty liberty, but you looked the kind of man who would understand. I've had you in my mind all this week when things got troublesome. Say, will you do me a good turn?"
8 "I'll listen to you," I said. "That's all I'll promise." I was getting worried by the antics of this nervous little chap.
9 There was a tray of coffee on a table beside him, from which he filled himself a cup. He drank it off in three gulps, and cracked the cup as he set it down.
10 "Pardon," he said, "I'm a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at this moment to be dead."
11 "What does it feel like?" I asked. I was pretty certain that I had to deal with a madman.
12 A smile flickered over his drawn face. "I'm not mad—yet. I'm going to confide in you. I need help worse than any man ever needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in."
13 "Get on with your yarn," I said, "and I'll tell you."
14 He was an American, from Kentucky, and after college, being pretty well off, he had started out to see the world. He wrote a bit, and acted as war correspondent for a Chicago paper, and spent a year or two in South-Eastern Europe. I gathered that he was a fine linguist, and had got to know pretty well the society in those parts. He spoke familiarly of many names that I remembered to have seen in the newspapers.
15 He had played about with politics, he told me, at first for the interest of them, and then because he couldn't help himself. I read him as a sharp, restless fellow, who always wanted to get down to the roots of things. He got a little further down than he wanted.

                            19. ___1. The end of a story, novel or script includes the last plot element. It is here that loose ends are tied up, conflicts are concluded, outcomes are revealed, and a happy or sad ending takes place. As many of the final actions have already taken place, this part of the plot can be made up of just a summary of where the main character will end up in the future, instead of including any more active events, ___2. It is where the basic characters and plot elements such as settings are revealed. In most cases the major conflict of the story, novel or script is also hinted at in this element, though smaller conflicts in the plot may be introduced later. In a shorter work, the introduction happens within the first few paragraphs, while in a longer work such as a novel it will happen within the first few chapters. ___3. This part of the plot includes events that will help to fully resolve the conflict. The results of actions that the main character has taken are presented as well as the results of decisions that have been made, whether good or bad for the character. ___4. This is the turning point of the story, novel, or script. It is the moment where it seems like the main character is in danger or could even possibly fail at resolving the conflict. Depending on the kind of conflict being faced, (man vs man, man vs self, and others) the actions at this point in the work can be either physical or mental.___5.

                            20. Activity 4.2 Instructions. Read the summary of the story below and answer the question that follows. (20 points) There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to get as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it tumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired blowing, the bamboo tree stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet," the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well - lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope." The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives up, no matter how hard life was before and even now... the FILIPINO remains to be PLIANT like the Bamboo..1. What is the Filipino positive characteristics describe in the selection? 2.

Text #1 It is physically impossible for a well-educated, intellectual, or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts just as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them. All healthy people like their dinners, but their dinner is not the main object of their lives. So all healthy minded people like making money ought to like it and enjoy the sensation of winning it; it is something better than money. A good soldier, for instance, mainly wishes to do his fighting well. He is glad of his pay-very properly so and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it-till, his main mission of life is to win battles, not to be paid for winning them. So of clergymen. The clergyman's object is essentially baptize and preach not to be paid for preaching. So of doctors. They like fees no doubt-ought to like them; yet if they are brave and well-educated the entire object to their lives is not fees. They on the whole, desire to cure the sick; and if they are good doctors and 26 Summary a Precis and the choice were fairly to them, would rather cure their patient and lose their fee than kill him and get it. And so with all the other brave and rightly trained men: their work is first, their fee second-very important always; but still second.  Text #2 Home is the young, who known "nothing of the world and who would be forlorn and sad, if thrown upon it. It is providential, shelter of the weak and inexperienced, who have to learn as yet to cope with the temptations which lies outside of it. It is the place of training of those who are not only ignorant, but have no yet learnt how to learn, and who have to be taught by careful individual trail, how to set about profiting by the lessons of teacher. And it is the school of elementary studies-not of advances, for such studies alone can make master minds. Moreover, it is the shrine of our best affections, the bosom of our fondest recollections, at spell upon our after life, a stay for world weary mind and soul; wherever we are, till the end comes. Such are attributes or offices of home, and like to these, in one or other sense or measure, are the attributes and offices of a college in a university.  Text #3 Teaching is the noblest of professions. A teacher has a sacred duty to perform. It is he on whom rests the responsibility of moulding the character of young children. Apart from developing their intellect, he can inculcate in them qualities of good citizenship, remaining neat and clean, talking decently and sitting properly. These virtues are not easy to be imbibed. Only he who himself leads a life of simplicity, purity and rigid discipline can successfully cultivate these habits in his pupils. Besides a teacher always remain young. He may grow old in age, but not in spite. Perpetual contact with budding youths keeps him happy and cheerful. There are moments when domestic worries weigh heavily on his mind, but the delightful company of innocent children makes him overcome his transient moods of despair. ​</h2><br />
