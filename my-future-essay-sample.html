                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Community is very important and has many factors like kinship, unity, and identity.  Community helps society because it creates solutions, provides security and reveals dedication.  It discovers truthfulness.  Communities are part of everyday life and have positive affects on its members. Communities can be found everywhere and can be created anywhere.  You may be unaware of it, but you are part of a community not only based on your location, but also based on your lifestyle, your religion, your heritage, your education, or your abilities.  As Hewitt once said,</p><p></p><p>“Community provides a psychological world and a place of identification for its members.” </p><p> </p><p>    Identifying yourself with a particular community may be easier than it…show more content…</p><p>Observing others’ behaviors lets one realize and understand more about different types and kinds of people.  Seeing how certain groups or communities act or react to situations lets us see more perspective and hopefully appreciate their point of view.  It is important to be part of communities for much of the same reason.  When you are part of a group, you understand and compromise with the other members of the group.  Discussing issues involving the community helps to lead to solutions.  Talking things through with other members improves social skills as well as relationships.  Knowing how people feel about certain issues let you know more about that person, and in turn, you learn more about yourself.  Hearing what other people have to say may sway your own opinions about something.  </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear Future Me,</p><p></p><p>I am writing this letter to you as a way to reflect on my present self and my hopes for my future. I am at a point in my life where I am facing new challenges and seeking new opportunities, and I want to take a moment to capture my thoughts and dreams for the years to come.</p><p></p><p>As I look back on my past, I am grateful for all the experiences I have had, both the good and the bad. I know that these experiences have shaped me into the person I am today, and they have given me the strength and resilience to face whatever lies ahead.</p><p></p><p>I know that the years to come will bring new challenges and trials, but I also know that I am capable of overcoming them. I believe in myself, and I know that I have what it takes to achieve my goals. I may not always make the right decisions or face the right direction, but I know that I have the ability to learn from my mistakes and grow from them.</p><p></p><p>In addition to keeping my sense of wonder, I also want to remember to be patient and kind to myself. I know that life can be both fleeting and unpredictable, and I don't want to waste my time beating myself up over past mistakes or stressing about the future. Instead, I want to learn to appreciate the present moment and celebrate all the joys and adventures that life has to offer.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Hope it helps :)</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Gender equality is not just the concern of half of the world’s population; it is a human right, a concern for us all, because no society can develop – economically, politically, or socially – when half of its population is marginalized. We must leave no one behind.</p><p></p><p>This is a year of global action. Governments will adopt a new set of Sustainable Development Goals, work together to draft a meaningful climate agreement, and craft a framework to provide the financial resources needed to deliver on a global sustainable development agenda. Those participating would be wise to remember that inclusive sustainable development can be realized only when all human rights – including gender equality – are protected, respected, and fulfilled.</p><br />

The natural direction of communication is to explain what you understand to someone who doesn’t understand it. But in writing an essay for a teacher your task is usually to explain what you are still engaged in trying to understand to someone who understands it better.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Teacher Who Inspires Me</p><p></p><p>Throughout our academic journey, we meet different types of teachers - some are strict, some are lenient, and some are just there to fulfill their job description. However, there are only a few teachers who leave a lasting impact on our lives. For me, that teacher is Mrs. Smith.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Smith was my English teacher in high school, and she was unlike any other teacher I had ever met. She had a unique way of teaching, which made the subject interesting and engaging. Her classes were always full of fun activities, discussions, and debates. She had an incredible passion for literature, and it was evident in the way she taught.</p><p></p><p>What inspired me the most about Mrs. Smith was her dedication towards her students. She was not just a teacher, but a mentor, a guide, and a friend. She was always available to help her students, even beyond the classroom. She encouraged us to pursue our interests and to think outside the box. She always believed in our potential and motivated us to do our best.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Smith was not just concerned about our academic performance, but our overall development as well. She often gave us valuable life lessons, which have stayed with me even today. Her positivity and enthusiasm were infectious, and it was impossible to leave her class without feeling inspired.</p><p></p><p>Under her guidance, I discovered my love for literature and writing. She always pushed me to take on new challenges and to never settle for mediocrity. It was her encouragement that helped me become a better writer and develop my own unique style.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Mrs. Smith was not just a teacher who taught me English, but a teacher who inspired me to become a better person. She instilled in me a love for learning, a passion for literature, and a drive to succeed. She is the reason why I believe that teachers can make a significant impact on their students' lives. I am grateful to have had her as my teacher and will always cherish the lessons she taught me.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I have had many teachers in my lifetime and each one of them has affected my attitude toward education in a unique way. I have developed a different relationship with each one of them; and of course, I reminisce about some of my teachers more than other s. A teacher never knows which student he or she is going to inspire to achieve his or her goals. Sometimes, a teacher might feel that he or she has not done much for a student, but that student might feel that that particular teacher has highly contributed to his or her education and has undoubtedly affected his or her attitude about education in a positive way. The purpose of this essay is to describe a teacher who has positively affected my attitude toward education.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Time is important, and the decisions taken in a 24-hour cycle can have a huge effect on the future.</p><p></p><p>It means I engage myself in appropriate activities that are important to a secured and invested future at the appropriate time period. For example, to invest in my future, I must not use up all my time to watch television or being on social networks when I can use the same free time to study.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Its a possible answer..

                        I want my future family to have similar aspects of my current family, such as loving my children as much as my mom does, along with aspects of Gil’s family, like how even when he was stressed, he still stayed and cared for his family. Even as a child, I have always thought I would be a fun mother, and I hope to have a family somewhat of the likes of Gil’s. His children had fun, and, although he was stressed out often times, he found a way to still make time for what matters most: being with his family. I know it will be a little hard to obtain this goal, but I will try my very best to make a loving family who will go out on a limb for you. I believe a family should do anything for you when you need them most and I will shape my children into people I would want to be friends with. In order for me to try to keep qualities like my family now, I would need to work with the parenting styles my parents have shown me through the years.Hope it helps!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>"MY PRESENT, MY FUTURE, MY RESPONSIBILITY"</strong></p><p>I am who I am. My life is according to my decisions, actions, attributes and attitude.</p><p> At <strong>present</strong>, I am a person who is still in the process of self-actualization. I am currently learning from my experiences. I continuously grow for self-actualization. My experiences taught me lessons which keeps me in my holistic development.</p><p>With the constant changes and evolution in my life, I wish to be someone who is already self-aware in the<strong> future</strong>. I hope to find the best me, a better version of myself. Someone who is confident enough, fulfilled enough and stronger than before to conquer the realities in life.</p><p>Together with my hopes and wishes of self-actualization, I am well-aware that I play a great <strong>responsibility</strong> in forming myself. As I explore to learn, I know that I need to take full responsibility with my actions. I need to be sensitive enough to know when I crossed the borders of morality and immorality and must determine the good decisions in my life. </p><p>Moving forward, I know it's not going to be and easy task. Living is a complex job in this world. However, I can say it loud and clear that I am determined enough to conquer LIFE, may it be at my present and in the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BrainlyFast</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            21. my education my contribution to the future.essay pake answer po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My gift to the future is my education. I have no knowledge of politics or economics. Political activism is what I do. The government doesn't interest me. My education was useless, and neither the books I studied nor the lessons I acquired from my college students counted. My political education was limited to a university course on "Socialism and Capitalism" that I took with a group of middle- and upper-class individuals from what I refer to as the Third World. In the end, I think I entered the Second World. I continue to support anarchism. The issue with anarchism is that it is built on a sort of idealistic illusion and that it will not function if it is founded on something like communism. To be able to live in peace with a new and different society, in which to spend my life and in which I am free to act on what I want, however, will destroy an entire generation of anarchists. I wished to improve myself. I want individuals who aspire to improve themselves. I aspired to write more effectively. I'm curious as to what it would take to alter a culture that, in reality, fails miserably. I want to improve myself as a person. I'd rather not go to work. I want to be a better person than my parents, not to take over their position or whatever they call themselves. Unlike the other wealthy individuals, who believe that everything revolves around one person not having to exist.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps </p><p>#carryonlearning</p><br />

First of all, animals provide humans with food for example cows and chicken. Secondly they can be used for protection for example dogs and also to aid the handicapped. Animals like horses and donkeys are used as a means of transportation and for recreation activities like racing. Lastly, animals can be used as companions to humans. They are known as pets and most people value them so much such that they even end up giving them a respectful burial in a pet cemetery after they die. This forms our discussion for today (Hartsdale Pet Cemetery) which is the final resting place for nearly 70,000 pets including dogs, cats, birds, rabbits and even a lion cub (Waldau, 2011).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

I'm now at home every day and it really is affecting me socially. Not being able to speak to friends and see people I see on a regular basis is hard for me. Also, now that school is closed for the rest of the year it has really had an effect on my school life. I am not used to being at home all the time and working on the computer. I'm usually in a classroom surrounded by my peers. However, I am human so I will learn to adapt, but for now it is hard.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>         It has affected me personally in the social and educational aspect, but I know around the city of Detroit it's affecting others as well. In Detroit, which is one of the cities around the country hit hard by the virus, the pandemic has also affected the youth. Youth are now forced to stay home instead of going to school and spending time with friends. Most kids need to be outside and with people to release their energy and socialize. Now this cannot happen, because the virus has affected us so much. One thing we also see happening is food insecurities and social distancing. Due to what is happening in the world, people are very much afraid and cautious about food supply and interactions with people. People are afraid and are told to stay inside, so we stock up supplies that will last them about a month. Usually people get stuff that we will last them about two weeks, but now we need to stay home as much as we can.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>         </p><p> </p><p></p><br />
