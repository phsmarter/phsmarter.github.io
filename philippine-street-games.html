Margielyn Didal hopes skateboarding reputation changes after Olympics debut
By: Bong Lozada - INQUIRER.net/ 08:23 PM August 04, 2021
MANILA, Philippines-Margielyn Didal's debut in the Olympics may not have produced a
medal but her impact outside of Tokyo was surely felt.
While she became a social media darling in Brazil, her influence in her own country of the
Philippines could be the start of a new sporting revolution.
Didal hopes that skateboarding's debut in the Tokyo Olympics could lead to Filipino
children taking up the sport and the society looking at it in a different light.
"The skate scene in the Philippines is really big already but I can't really tell how big it is
because skateboarding as a sport is kind of new," said Didal in a virtual press conference.
"I've been a skateboarder for nine, 10 years already and it's grown big."
or's
CHOUDTA
"It's already big but I know it'll get bigger because they included skateboarding in the Olympics."
Didal was a trailblazer in the Philippine sporting scene becoming the first Filipino to join the X Games and was a gold medalist in both the
Southeast Asian Games and Asian Games.
Her World Skate ranking eventually put her in the Summer Games and it was on the international stage became a household name outside the
Philippines
The Tokyo Olympics' social media accounts heavily pushed Didal as her antics and overall friendliness attached her to Brazil's sporting
community when she hit it off with women's street silver medalist Rayssa Leal.
Didal further gained attention when her post with Tony Hawk, arguably the greatest skateboarder of all time, went viral.
The Cebu City native hoped that through the Olympic exposure that skateboarding will become more mainstream and not a sport shrouded
under a negative reputation
"I hope that it can be seen better, I want to spread the good vibes," said Didal who finished seventh in the women's street final. "I hope they
saw that here in skateboarding that there is really a big chance to enter the Olympics.

Margielyn Didal hopes skateboarding reputation changes after Olympics debut
By: Bong Lozada - INQUIRER.net/ 08:23 PM August 04, 2021
MANILA, Philippines-Margielyn Didal's debut in the Olympics may not have produced a
medal but her impact outside of Tokyo was surely felt.
While she became a social media darling in Brazil, her influence in her own country of the
Philippines could be the start of a new sporting revolution.
Didal hopes that skateboarding's debut in the Tokyo Olympics could lead to Filipino
children taking up the sport and the society looking at it in a different light.
"The skate scene in the Philippines is really big already but I can't really tell how big it is
because skateboarding as a sport is kind of new," said Didal in a virtual press conference.
"I've been a skateboarder for nine, 10 years already and it's grown big."
or's
CHOUDTA
"It's already big but I know it'll get bigger because they included skateboarding in the Olympics."
Didal was a trailblazer in the Philippine sporting scene becoming the first Filipino to join the X Games and was a gold medalist in both the
Southeast Asian Games and Asian Games.
Her World Skate ranking eventually put her in the Summer Games and it was on the international stage became a household name outside the
Philippines
The Tokyo Olympics' social media accounts heavily pushed Didal as her antics and overall friendliness attached her to Brazil's sporting
community when she hit it off with women's street silver medalist Rayssa Leal.
Didal further gained attention when her post with Tony Hawk, arguably the greatest skateboarder of all time, went viral.
The Cebu City native hoped that through the Olympic exposure that skateboarding will become more mainstream and not a sport shrouded
under a negative reputation
"I hope that it can be seen better, I want to spread the good vibes," said Didal who finished seventh in the women's street final. "I hope they
saw that here in skateboarding that there is really a big chance to enter the Olympics.
