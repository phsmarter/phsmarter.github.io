Ideas in writing a comparison-and-contrast paragraph could be arranged side-by-sidewhich means all thedetails in first item will be described thoroughly followed by the descriptions of second Item12. The logical arrangement of Ideas is known as the pattern of paragraph13. In determining the pattern of development of ideas, note the signal words used.14. The signal words may help you identify the pattern of development, but it is more important that youunderstand the meaning of text15. "In the meantime" is a signal word for comparing,16.

In an essay, the body begins with the restatement of the thesis statement using a different structure andwording to uphold the language style.20. Cohesive devices are sentences that clarify and prove the main idea21. Unlike a paragraph, an essay has a more elaborate structure22. Unity is achieved when a composition contains several distinct ideas.23. Cohesion occurs when ideas are connected at the conceptual or Idea level. It can be seen through well-defended arguments and organized points.24. Coherence is the connection of ideas at the sentence level. It can be readily seen in a text through the smoothflow of the sentences and the connection of the ideas.25. The technical aspect of writing, also known as mechanics, should not be overlooked when writing. The use ofcontractions (eg, shouldn't) is encouraged and numbers from zero to ten should be spelled out while numbershigher than ten should be written In figures.​</a>

                                            What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight
4. Feed Conversion Rate
• A satisfactory conversion ratio should be 1 kg live weight gain for 3 to
5 kg of feed consumed by an animal.
5. Costs and Returns of Production
• All expenses and sales recorded for one year to compute the returns
on your investment (ROI) at the end of the year.</a>

                                            actually depends on the particular definition you are using.Luminosity is a star’s energy output per second. It does not depend on the distance to the star. Loosely speaking, luminosity is how “bright” a star really is. However, brightness has three different meanings in astronomy, as follows:a) Brightness can mean the same as luminosity, in which case it should really be referred to as intrinsic brightness.b) The second meaning is more correctly referred to as apparent brightness. It is the light energy per second per unit area detected by an observer. It is also called the star’s flux. The distance to the star is important in this case.c) Thirdly, apparent brightness can simply be another way of referring to a star’s apparent magnitude (see the Footnote below for more on apparent magnitude).Despite the detrimental impact on economies around the world, the pandemic may have been more of a game of winners and losers than some had previously assumed. Changes in customer demand, surges in online shopping and incentivised opportunities for entrepreneurs presented a more favourable business landscape for start-ups in certain industries compared to more established companies which were unable to adapt to the changing times.Undoubtedly, COVID-19 challenged businesses in more ways than one. Companies all over the world were forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviours and restructure their approach to business almost overnight. While this transformation seems to have left some behind, it is the tech-savvy, younger generation of entrepreneurs who have not only survived, but thrived as a result. You may be wondering why?Digital First ApproachOngoing lockdowns and the move to working from home resulted in a greater reliance on technology in almost every aspect of our lives, and, for a number of start-ups, this presented an opportunity for growth. Companies without the structures in place to support remote work will have felt the impact almost immediately, while newer start-ups that were more accustomed to the digital world were able to quickly adapt to the new economic environment.Similarly, businesses without an online presence would have struggled following the shift to online shopping while several EdTech, pharma and fashion e-tailer start-ups benefitted from robust digital marketing strategies, cementing themselves in hyperlocal trade and door-to-door deliveries. The crisis also became an unexpected catalyst for growth for certain industries such as delivery services, commercial cleaning and online fitness and wellness programmes that may have been previously overlooked by the average consumer.​</a>

                            13. What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight
4. Feed Conversion Rate
• A satisfactory conversion ratio should be 1 kg live weight gain for 3 to
5 kg of feed consumed by an animal.
5. Costs and Returns of Production

                            15. actually depends on the particular definition you are using.Luminosity is a star’s energy output per second. It does not depend on the distance to the star. Loosely speaking, luminosity is how “bright” a star really is. However, brightness has three different meanings in astronomy, as follows:a) Brightness can mean the same as luminosity, in which case it should really be referred to as intrinsic brightness.b) The second meaning is more correctly referred to as apparent brightness. It is the light energy per second per unit area detected by an observer. It is also called the star’s flux. The distance to the star is important in this case.c) Thirdly, apparent brightness can simply be another way of referring to a star’s apparent magnitude (see the Footnote below for more on apparent magnitude).Despite the detrimental impact on economies around the world, the pandemic may have been more of a game of winners and losers than some had previously assumed. Changes in customer demand, surges in online shopping and incentivised opportunities for entrepreneurs presented a more favourable business landscape for start-ups in certain industries compared to more established companies which were unable to adapt to the changing times.Undoubtedly, COVID-19 challenged businesses in more ways than one. Companies all over the world were forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviours and restructure their approach to business almost overnight. While this transformation seems to have left some behind, it is the tech-savvy, younger generation of entrepreneurs who have not only survived, but thrived as a result. You may be wondering why?Digital First ApproachOngoing lockdowns and the move to working from home resulted in a greater reliance on technology in almost every aspect of our lives, and, for a number of start-ups, this presented an opportunity for growth. Companies without the structures in place to support remote work will have felt the impact almost immediately, while newer start-ups that were more accustomed to the digital world were able to quickly adapt to the new economic environment.Similarly, businesses without an online presence would have struggled following the shift to online shopping while several EdTech, pharma and fashion e-tailer start-ups benefitted from robust digital marketing strategies, cementing themselves in hyperlocal trade and door-to-door deliveries. The crisis also became an unexpected catalyst for growth for certain industries such as delivery services, commercial cleaning and online fitness and wellness programmes that may have been previously overlooked by the average consumer.​</h2><br />
