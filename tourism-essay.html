The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes". Tourism is vital for the success of many economies around the world. There are several benefits of tourism on host destinations. Tourism boosts the revenue of the economy, creates thousands of jobs, develops the infrastructures of a country, and plants a sense of cultural exchange between foreigners and citizens.<br />

More precisely, when will they return, and will it be soon enough to save destination economies?</p><p></p><p>Notwithstanding the economic impact of lockdowns, and potentially high levels of unemployment and inflation long after they are eased (which will also infringe upon a person’s ability to spend money on a holiday), Covid-19 demonstrates all too well the unpredictability of exogenous factors and their implications on tourist motivation and tourism demand.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kung ayaw niyo pong isulat okay lang,gusto ko lang naman tumulong sa inyo</p><br />
