                                            The pro-choice or pro-abortion advocates contend that the fetus is not human. Hence, if it is not human it is not national. Hence, they infer that abortion is not killing or murder of the unborn human being. They go as far as saying that for a human being to be rational it has to demonstrate indicators that show his rationality like the faculty to think, understand, know reason analyses decide, use language, be risible and other rational acts as human beings do. Not a single act of the above is ever present in the fetus or can be demonstrated by it. Hence, it should be concluded that a fetus is not human. When these arguments are forwarded by the prochoice, it is well to start with the questions: When does human life begin? What does it mean to be human IS humanity's attribute based solely on one's overt rational capability as argued above? What do you think of one's humanity as based on one's ontological and functional nature? Please explain. Do you really think that a fetus is human? What is your personal view on this?

MEANS:</p><p>     Be the reason for which someone smiles! Today, we have become so busy in the hustle bustle of our regular lives that we have forgotten the true sense of living.</p><p>It is important to understand you should always be able to realize your purpose of living and thus try to figure out about all that you can do in order to make someone smile.</p><p>You will probably not be able to comprehend the value and happiness that you will get until you become successful in making someone else smile.</p><p>Know that life is very short and it will get over in just a flick. However, if you want to enjoy life and live each and every moment that you have in your hand, you ought to find happiness in someone else.</p><p>You should try to do something in order to make even a stranger happy and once you are able to do it, you shall sense a different kind of happiness within yourself!</p><p>Be the reason someone feels loved. Yes, it is important to understand that you should always be able to spread love around yourself.</p><p>Do not get so succumbed to the materialistic pleasures of life that you forget its real meaning. Always try to spread love among people around you. Make sure that you love others, and make them feel happy.</p><p>Be it a stranger, or even your known acquaintances, always speak to them with a kind heart and a polite attitude and that will make both of you feel happy and loved. Trust me it does work like magic!</p><p>Be the reason someone believes in the goodness in people. In today’s world, you will hardly find people around you who will be able to count you positively.</p><p>You shall find so many people around who are so engaged in finding faults in everyone that there’s hardly any who is going to make you feel good about you.</p><p>Looking around, it feels as if the goodness in people has been lost somewhere, and you would probably feel as if there’s no good people alive on this earth any more.</p><p>This world is filled with so many cruel souls that hardly anyone will believe the existence of a good and pure soul. However, make sure that you are one of those ‘kind souls’ that will make the innocent ones realize that humanity is still alive!</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan po ang sagot ko</p><p>sana makatulong ^-^</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>GANDAQ</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#CARRYONLEARNING</p><br />

                            26. The pro-choice or pro-abortion advocates contend that the fetus is not human. Hence, if it is not human it is not national. Hence, they infer that abortion is not killing or murder of the unborn human being. They go as far as saying that for a human being to be rational it has to demonstrate indicators that show his rationality like the faculty to think, understand, know reason analyses decide, use language, be risible and other rational acts as human beings do. Not a single act of the above is ever present in the fetus or can be demonstrated by it. Hence, it should be concluded that a fetus is not human. When these arguments are forwarded by the prochoice, it is well to start with the questions: When does human life begin? What does it mean to be human IS humanity's attribute based solely on one's overt rational capability as argued above? What do you think of one's humanity as based on one's ontological and functional nature? Please explain. Do you really think that a fetus is human? What is your personal view on this? Explain briefly. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Abortion is an example of a very controversial issue. The two opposing viewpoints surrounding abortion are like two sides of a coin. On one side, there is the pro-choice activist and on the other is the pro-life activist. The argument is a balanced one; for every point supporting abortion there is a counter-point condemning abortion. This essay will delineate the controversy in one type of comparison/contrast essay form: the "Argument versus Argument," or, "Block-by-Block" format. In this style of writing, first you present all the arguments surrounding one side of the issue, then you present all the arguments surrounding the other side of the issue. You are generally not expected to reach a conclusion, but simply to present the opposing sides of the </strong><strong>argum</strong><strong>ents</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>This</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ans</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>corre</strong><strong>ct</strong><strong> </strong><strong>copy</strong><strong>ing</strong><strong> </strong><strong>this</strong><strong> </strong><strong>if</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> </strong><strong>want</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></p><br />
