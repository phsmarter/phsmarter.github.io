                                            What I Need to Know In this week’s lesson, you are to be introduced to the world of research as a discipline. Often, you hear your teachers ask you to do research on a certain assignment. Or you research to get information about a certain person, event, or a company. Sometimes, a problem needs to be studied carefully before a solution can be formulated. This process of carefully gathering information for whatever purpose it might serve is an example of a simple research.  At the end of this week, you are expected to: 1. define research;2. differentiate between inquiry and research;3. characterize research and enumerate the steps followed when conducting one;4. articulate the importance of research in daily life;5. share research experience and knowledge; 6. display a deeper appreciation for the value of research.please help me​</a>

Sometimes, a problem needs to be studied carefully before a solution can be formulated. This process of carefully gathering information for whatever purpose it might serve is an example of a simple research.  At the end of this week, you are expected to: 1. define research;2. differentiate between inquiry and research;3. characterize research and enumerate the steps followed when conducting one;4. articulate the importance of research in daily life;5. share research experience and knowledge; 6. display a deeper appreciation for the value of research.please help me​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many currently available drugs show unfavourable physicochemical properties for delivery into or across the skin and temporary chemical modulation of the penetrant is one option to achieve improved delivery properties. Pro-drugs are chemical derivatives of an active drug which is covalently bonded to an inactive pro-moiety in order to overcome pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic barriers. A pro-drug relies upon conversion within the body to release the parent active drug (and pro-moiety) to elicit its pharmacological effect. The main drawback of this approach is that the pro-moiety is essentially an unwanted ballast which, when released, can lead to adverse effects. The term 'co-drug' refers to two or more therapeutic compounds active against the same disease bonded via a covalent chemical linkage and it is this approach which is reviewed for the first time in the current article. For topically applied co-drugs, each moiety is liberated in situ, either chemically or enzymatically, once the stratum corneum barrier has been overcome by the co-drug. Advantages include synergistic modulation of the disease process, enhancement of drug delivery and pharmacokinetic properties and the potential to enhance stability by masking of labile functional groups. The amount of published work on co-drugs is limited but the available data suggest the co-drug concept could provide a significant therapeutic improvement in dermatological diseases. However, the applicability of the co-drug approach is subject to strict limitations pertaining mainly to the availability of compatible moieties and physicochemical properties of the overall molecule.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>i i hope i can help </p><p></p><br />
