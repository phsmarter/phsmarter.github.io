Evaluate Decision Effectiveness. This is the last step and involves the evaluation of the outcome or result of the decision to see if the problem was resolved. If the problem still exists, the manager has to assess what went wrong and, if needed, repeat a step or the whole process.
Develop Alternatives. This step requires the decision maker to list down possible alternatives that could help resolve the identified problems.
Identify the Problem. The problem may be defined as a puzzling circumstance or a discrepancy between an existing and a desired condition.
Identify the Decision Criteria . These are important or relevant to resolving the identified the problem.
Allocate Weights to the Criteria. This is done in order to give the decision maker the correct priority in making the decision.
Analyze the Alternatives. Alternatives must be carefully evaluated by the decision maker using the criteria identified in Step 2.
Select an Alternative: This is the process of choosing the best alternative or the one which has the highest total points in Step 5.
Implement the Chosen Alternative. This step puts the decision into action. Changes in the environment must be observed and assessed, especially in cases of long-term, decision, to see if the chosen alternative is still the best one.</a>
