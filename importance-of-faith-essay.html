                        faith is a very important factor in our everyday life. if we do not have faith, we wont be able to believe in hope.<br />

                            2. write a reflection essay synthesizing the importance of faith</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The primary challenge modern culture offers Christian faith is that the former is itself the fruit of a historico-cultural process deeply influenced by Christian faith. In many ways modern culture is an elevated, sophisticated one, containing a great variety of precious anthropological insights and strengths, with a surprising adaptability and openness to absorb, to clarify and to unite. However in the present moment it comes across, in many cases, as a ‘culture without faith’, a culture wilfully disconnected from the faith that gave life to it in the first place, and thus, ultimately, a fragile culture. This has led many of those influenced by modern culture to a generalised loss of faith and to a pathology of individualism and ingratitude, as they attempt to live in isolation from their fellows, unprepared to recognise the world they live in and the privileges they enjoy as God’s gifts. This suggests the need to widen the scope of human rationality in two directions: with others and towards others; other humans and ultimately God, the source of all goodness and truth. This study will consider the relationship between culture and Christian faith in terms of the influence of faith on culture and of culture on faith, with a view to understanding (1) how modern culture, formed and informed to an important degree by faith, now challenges faith anew to provide answers to questions that have not been asked before, and (</p><p>not just by posing new questions. The topic of course is very ample and complex, and so the study will only provide an introductory reflection.</p><br />

That is not surprising. Many around the world are sick and many others have died. Unless the situation changes dramatically, many more will fall ill and die around the globe. This crisis raises serious medical, ethical and logistical questions. But it raises additional questions for people of faith. So I would like to offer some advice from the Christian tradition, Ignatian spirituality and my own experience.</p><p></p><p>Resist panic. This is not to say there is no reason to be concerned, or that we should ignore the sound advice of medical professionals and public health experts. But panic and fear are not from God. Calm and hope are. And it is possible to respond to a crisis seriously and deliberately while maintaining an inner sense of calm and hope.</p><br />

                            6. "Moving forward in faith and excellence amidst challenges" essay​</h2><br />
                        <p>                                     "Moving forward by faith"</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are certain moments in our lives that give us pause. They stop us in our tracks and challenge us to reflect on our priorities, our relationships and our purpose.These moments come when we face a difficult diagnosis, a significant milestone or an unexpected change in life circumstances. We face these moments in the death of a friend, family member or public figure, especially when the loss is tragic and untimely.When we pause, we take time to process with others, to share stories, to pray and to examine our own lives. Life slows down.</p><p>In his book “Following Jesus,” Henri Nouwen reflects on two types of people, the “running-around” ones and the “just-sitting-there” ones. It seems to me that these types represent two paths people may be tempted to take after a major change or loss.Referring to the people who “run around” or the “wanderers,” Nouwen writes: “We are people who run around a lot, do many things, meet many people, attend many events, read many books. We are very involved. We experience life as many, many things. We go here, we go there, we do this, we do that, we speak to him, we speak to her, we have this to do and that to do.”</p><p>Indeed, one way to move forward is to stay very busy and involved. The problem is that it can be exhausting. People who wander from one thing to the other can be very tired and stressed. They’re caught up in the rat race; life becomes automatic and routine, and may lose its meaning.A professor once demonstrated to his class that if you are filling a jar with rocks, it is best to put the big rocks in first followed by the gravel, sand and water. If done in reverse, the big rocks may not fit. Having a focus and clear priorities allows us to live forward with meaning and purpose in the midst of our busy lives.</p><p>because i dont what u saying so whatchu gonna do wachu wachu gonna do with a pitpat bot</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>iieowoqosowowowueue</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a young girl growing up in the church, I was always encouraged to base my faith on Mary’s. After all, she’s the mother of Jesus. She’s the epitome of being used to bring the Kingdom to fruition – quite literally. She’s the manifestation of submissive faith, of perfect trust, of putting God’s will above one’s own. When the angel approached her with God’s plan, this “favored one” (Luke 1:28) humbly responded, “Let it be to me according to your word” (Luke 1:38). Because of her virtue, Mary is held high in all church traditions, especially Catholicism. In so many churches, she’s promoted as a role model for all Christian girls.</p><p></p><p>But if I casually came home one evening and told my parents that I was pregnant, I don’t think they’d be too pleased. And if I told them not to worry because the baby didn’t belong to my fiancé, I think they’d worry even more. And I don’t think that informing them of my intact virginity – explaining that the Holy Spirit miraculously conceived the baby – would mend the newly torn rift in our relationship.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Tama po sya mark mo po sya...</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>QualityThere are several virtues that I hold true in my life. Faith, hope, love, prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude are all a part of me. However, there are two virtues that are most prominent: fortitude and faith. When I was in the seventh grade, both of my maternal grandparents passed away within a month of each other. Growing up, my grandparents and I were never apart. They lived a mile down the road and I never went a day without seeing them. I had my own room and I would often join my grandparents in the evening for dinner. I received the first set of devastating news during the previous summer. I had come home from summer camp when my mom told me that my grandmother was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Catholics believe that all people are of good nature but when one commits a sin it not only hurts that one person but the people and the Church. Catholics are a Christian sect and believe in one God. Like other Christians, they believe that Jesus is God's Son which goes hand-in-hand with the belief in the Holy Trinity.</p><br />

                            14. Conquering challenges with faith and fortitude in real life essay. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Over the last year and a half, we have all experienced the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many have lost their jobs, restricted their movements, and faced heartbreaking deaths of family members and loved ones. These circumstances are reason enough to give up and lose the will to live. However, life is still too beautiful that in one way or another, we still receive blessings from God above. This is what keeps me going as an individual when faced with challenges. I have faith that all of these difficult circumstances will be over soon.
</p><p>Faith is an expression of complete trust or confidence in someone or something, especially in the context of religion. Fortitude is one’s mental and emotional strength in facing difficulties or pain. I believe that these go hand in hand. When one has a strong faith in God, one will be able to strengthen his or her mind and perceive the world in an optimistic manner. I am thankful that I have a strong faith in God. This has greatly helped me be steadfast in times of adversities.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Faith is very important in our lives because to achieve anything, having faith is very important. One doesn’t only have to show faith in God, showing faith in a human being is also very necessary. Sometimes, you need to show faith on your friends, your families or any other persons.</p><p></p><p>Importance of Faith</p><p>These are some points that show why faith is important in everyone’s life:</p><p></p><p>The power of faith – There are thousands of examples which clearly reflects the power of faith. It gets believed that even when you are starting from zero, but if you have the faith that you can do something, you will successful one day. All you need is to show an immense amount of faith in your ability and have patience because one day you will get the result of your hard work.</p><p></p><p>Failures are always learnings – A lot of people feel that if they fail once, that’s the end of their life. But the reality is that when we fail, it gives us the power to come back more powerfully. All you need to have is faith because if you have the faith within you that you can bring back your capability and ability together to do a task, then you can do what you were looking to do without getting failed. Even if you fail the second time, you shouldn’t stop there because if you have an aim, you should stop when you have achieved the aim and should not give up even when you fail once, twice, thrice or even more times.</p><p></p><p>Faith can help you reach your aim – There are thousands of persons who don’t know about their aims even when they enter their twenties. When you show faith in someone or on some tasks or business opportunities, it becomes your aim. For example, when you show faith that your business will do well, that faith will help you to do all the hard work so that your business can reach to a point where you want it to be.</p><p></p><p>It kills stress and anxiety – A lot of people nowadays look for solutions to stress and anxiety, and they travel to various doctors and consultants to make sure that they find the perfect solution for their problem. But they need to know that the real solution to get rid of stress and anxiety is to have faith in the jobs that are on your mind and then stop thinking about their future. For example, if you have opened a business and you are worried about its growth, you should only have faith on God and work hard. Your business will do great, you don’t need to stress about it.</p><p>Solutions – Showing faith is the solution to various key problems for human beings. A lot of people are going through depression due to several problems that they have in their lives. But, all they need do to is to have faith in God and feel that all the problems would get solved easily within some period.</p><p></p><p>Faith is the key in life and if you don’t have faith in yourself, on your beliefs, on your family, on your partner and on the plans that you are making, then surely you would fail in life. So, no matter how bad a situation you are in, having faith is always important.</p><p>Faith is an element that connects us to God as thought his promise was already fulfilled.</p><p>It takes faith to believe that anything will happen. If we don’t believe that God will bring us out of a situation, chances are our situation won’t change.</p><p>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</p><p>Faith is having a firm belief in God’s word and trusting in His infinite power and plans for our lives.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Essay Pls.
I will give the Brainiest pts that who can answer this. Ty</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A strong faith is necessary because of the emotion of fear. Fear is paralyzing. Fear can and will keep you from living the life that God has designed you to live. Fear of failure.</p><p>Why is it important? It is important because here we can see that we are interested in living with faith, although everyone has fears and anxieties in life but when the growth of your faith is important to you that will help you to lose your fear in life .</p><p>           It is especially important in our lives because if you help yourself to grow your faith you will gradually realize in yourself the word salvation because when you have faith and you are able to follow yourself you feel safe in what no matter what because you trust God that at any time he is there and he will not forsake you</p><br />

                        <p>Faith is like a check. All you have to do is hold on to the check, go to the bank to present it and you can confidently expect the money to appear in your account after a certain time. If you throw the check away the money will not be put in your account. God is trustworthy and always has resources to back his promises.</p><p></p><p>Living faith always has corresponding actions. We talk what we really believe, and we act according to what we really believe. The heroes of faith like Abraham were considered men of faith because they acted on what God showed them. They acted on their faith. (Hebrews 11:17-38, James 2:21-23).</p><p></p><p>To live in faith means to do and say what you believe is right, without doubting.</p><p></p><p>Faith is a rest. It is compatible with inner peace. It is not “trying to believe”. To say that you are “trying to believe” God is to say that you don’t believe Him. The man who is “trying to believe” may be sincere, but he does not have faith in that area yet.</p><p></p><p>Those who don’t believe God inevitably believe in something else. Either religious tradition, or their understanding of science, or what the women’s magazine says, or what their next door neighbor tells them, the education system, the mass-media or a combination of all these things. God is not impressed. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” (Romans 1:22) In fact, those who don’t fully believing God end up believing the devil somewhere along the track. It is very possible to believe what the devil says without even believing that he exists! Satan is speaking through so many philosophies and religions without openly declaring himself. Not too many actually know they are trusting the words of Satan and his demons.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlist po:)</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>Tom Hanks.</p>Tom is said to be a deeply religious man who regularly attends church. He has previously stated that his primary motivation for attending church is to encounter the great unanswered questions that humanity has always posed.The actor is known for being a very humble, down-to-earth guy, which is most likely due to his upbringing in a religious household.

Tom identified with a variety of religions, including Mormonism, Catholicism, and Evangelicalism.When Tom married Rita Wilson in 1988, he found a home in the Greek Orthodox Church. He has stated that he enjoys being Orthodox because the environment allows him to meditate and reflect on larger life issues. This was the point at which his faith truly matured.

Essay: Differentiate "theocracy" from "monarchy" based from the experience of the IsraelitesIn what form of government were the Israelites more faithful to the covenant? What were themost important contributions of the kings to the life and faith of the Israelite people?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>God began His plan to establish the nation of Israel with the call of Abraham and the making of the Abrahamic Covenant. The Abrahamic covenant is the foundation for all subsequent covenants that God made with Israel. God’s goal in making the covenants was for Israel to become a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exodus 19.5-6). While the nation has failed to achieve this goal it will be achieved in a future day for God is sovereign and keeps His promises. Everything God promised the nation through the covenants will be fulfilled when the Lord returns to set up His kingdom on earth and rule as “David’s greater Son” (Luke 1.31-33, 20.41-44; Matthew 6.10).</p><p></p><p>God revealed in the Abrahamic Covenant that Gentile blessing would henceforth be mediated through Israel (Isaiah 42.1, 60.1-3; Zechariah 8.22-23). This blessing assumed the obedience of national Israel. Blessings to Israel would ultimately come through the Messiah and blessing to Gentiles through Israel. But how could Gentiles be blessed in the face of Israel’s disobedience, i.e., rejection of their Messiah? The answer was that they couldn’t. God had no covenantal provision, no plan to bless Gentiles apart from Israel’s national obedience.</p><p></p><p>But God is tricky. Being sovereign and omniscient, He knew Israel would reject the Messiah and had a plan to bless Gentiles in spite of Israel’s failure. Instead of moving forward with the prophetic plan of the Day of the Lord, God expressed His love and grace to mankind by the call and conversion of Saul of Tarsus. Through Paul, God created the Church, the body of Christ, not on the basis of covenant (Ephesians 2.11-14) but through Paul, “the apostle to the Gentiles” (Romans 11.13). God created the body of Christ by grace alone (Ephesians 2.5, 8-9). This new creation, the body of Christ, was a “secret” (μυστήριον) until the ascended, resurrected Lord revealed it to Paul. Ultimately, God’s plans cannot be thwarted, even by the disobedience of man. He blessed Gentiles through the creation of the Church in the face of Israel’s fall (Romans 11.25). Yet a future day remains for national Israel. In that day, Israel will become obedient and fulfill their role as a blessing to the nations (Matthew 23.39; Romans 11.15). God is sovereign!</p><br />
