Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus:The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________Easy Warm-up: ________________________Fire Starter: ________________________Audience Reader:_________________________2. GOLBAL WARMING:Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects.POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________EASY WARM-UP:_________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________AUDIENCE READER:_____________________3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ______________________FIRE STARTER: ________________________AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence,POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________EASY WARM-UP:______________________FIRE STARTER:________________________AUDIENCE READER:___________________​</a>

Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus:The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________Easy Warm-up: ________________________Fire Starter: ________________________Audience Reader:_________________________2. GOLBAL WARMING:Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects.POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________EASY WARM-UP:_________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________AUDIENCE READER:_____________________3.

Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ______________________FIRE STARTER: ________________________AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence,POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________EASY WARM-UP:______________________FIRE STARTER:________________________AUDIENCE READER:___________________​</h2><br />
