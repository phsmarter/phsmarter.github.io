A key goal for historical critics is to realize the effect of a literary work upon its original readers.3. A main goal for formalist critics is to determine how elements of form (style, structure, tone, imagery, etc.) work togetherwith the text's content to shape its effects upon readers.-4. The essence of structuralism is the belief that things cannot be understood in isolation, they have to be seen in thecontext of larger structures which contain them.5. Feminist criticism attempts to correct this balance by evaluating and combatung such attitudes-by questioning, forexample, why none of the characters in Shakespeare's play Othello ever challenge the right of a husband to murder a wife accused ofadultery.6. Gender Crrücism is originally an offshoot of feminist movements, gender criticism today includes a number ofapproaches, Including the so-called "masculinist approach recently advocated by poet Robert Bly.7. Like an essay, a critique uses a informal, academic writing style and has a clear structure, that is, an introduction, bodyand conclusion8. Critique is a genre of academic writing that briefly summarizes and critically evaluates a work or concept.9. Before you start writing, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the work that will be critiqued._10. Structuralism focused on how human behavior is determined by social, cultural and psychological structures.​</a>
