                                            Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</a>

                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

                            5. Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</h2><br />

                            13. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I will agree with this, considering that religion plays a significant role in human society and culture. It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />
