                                            Organizing Your Text Before you start to write anything, take some time to plan your paragraphs. It is important to arrange your ideas and other details so that they will be presented in an organized way. This will make it easier for your reader to understand what you have written. Isn't it difficult to piece all your thoughts together when you have a lot to say? But if you have a framework to follow, you can arrange your points according to it. You no longer have to worry about your thoughts and ideas being muddled in the same paragraph. If you do not know of any kind of writing framework, don't worry. That's what this module is for. We shall go over several types of frameworks and you can choose your own for the next time you write something. In this lesson, you shall be introduced to the different kinds of rhetorical patterns of organization to help you plan the structure of your paragraphs. Hope you are ready!​</a>

                            29. Organizing Your Text Before you start to write anything, take some time to plan your paragraphs. It is important to arrange your ideas and other details so that they will be presented in an organized way. This will make it easier for your reader to understand what you have written. Isn't it difficult to piece all your thoughts together when you have a lot to say? But if you have a framework to follow, you can arrange your points according to it. You no longer have to worry about your thoughts and ideas being muddled in the same paragraph. If you do not know of any kind of writing framework, don't worry. That's what this module is for. We shall go over several types of frameworks and you can choose your own for the next time you write something. In this lesson, you shall be introduced to the different kinds of rhetorical patterns of organization to help you plan the structure of your paragraphs. Hope you are ready!​</h2><br />
