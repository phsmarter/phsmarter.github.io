Mother tongue is very important in everyone's life and it does not matter whether your mother tongue is the first language of your country or not, you should never forget your mother tongue.</p><p></p><p>Various researches say that whatever the boy learns in his mother language or first language, he understands and learns faster than anything he learns in any other language.</p><p></p><p>One can clearly see that if a person holds a lot on his mother tongue, he will learn all other languages â€‹â€‹very easily and this fact has been proved scientifically at different places.</p><p></p><p>A mother tongue represents the culture and society in which you are living, and it does not matter which country you are living in, you should never forget about your culture, heritage and society that gave birth to you .</p><p></p><p>Let us take an example, some of our ministers have been proud of their country in the last few years because they had full control of Hindi language in the international language, but also spoke their native language in Hindi. This gesture of those ministers made us feel proud of all the Indians because our original language was being displayed at the global level. Your country's ethics, etiquette and ethics can be learned only from your native language, as you use western language in most of your work, you will start forgetting your original language, and the way you have learned it. Do not forget to start in your initial steps. All of them have a lot of side effects because learning other languages â€‹â€‹can earn you more, but you can become a better person only through the use of your native language.</p><p></p><p>However, mother tongue is very important for every person, it is quite clear that people around the world are forgetting the use of their native language.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Thanks</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During this time, it can be easy to forget about the planet, and this Earth Day is a great time to remind ourselves of the importance of protecting the environment. There are many things that we can do on an individual, local, statewide, national, and worldwide scale to try to protect this planet.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest things you can try is writing to government representatives who have the power to set laws and regulations regarding the health of our planet. If enough people show that they care, they will listen. They can help with the larger issues such as deforestation, emissions, and the types of energy we use. This will definitely help, but perhaps the most important thing we can do is to be smart consumers and take a few minutes out of our busy lives to consider the environmental impact of the products we are buying. When enough people ask for something, our voices can be heard and we can use them to inspire change in the cycle of consumerism.</p><p></p><p>If we are to preserve this planet that we all live on, we cannot simply wait for others to solve our problems for us. We must take an active stand and show the world that we care. It is our individual and collective responsibility as a worldwide society to care for this planet on which we all live and depend.</p><p></p><br />

                        The effects of the COVID-19 panic has caused a massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly. Life adjustments often come with a wide range of experiences and emotions. Sometimes that transition can feel smooth and other times that journey to the new normal is choppy or downright bumpy!<br /><br />Some people may find themselves in survival mode, gathering information and resources necessary to function at school, work, as a person, and in our relationships with others. Others may be attempting to settle into their new routines. For some, this means trying to combat social isolation. For many, it means learning how to live (or re-live) with friends, family members, partners, or roommates, which is not always easy. I hear a lot of people struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. For myself, I feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. I’ve really had to be very compassionate and patient with myself lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting. Some people (and I hope there are a lot of you out there), have gone through the adjustment process and are finding comfort in your new norm. In all of this, here are a few important things to remember.<br /><br />This situation is both uncertain and temporary! It’s okay not to feel okay. It’s also okay (and encouraged) to seek help and support!<br />Consider this a time to reflect on who you want to be during this time.<br />Focus on what is within your control.<br />It’s good to be informed, and it’s a really good idea to take breaks from conversations, news, and information related to COVID-19.<br />Adjustment is a process that looks differently for most people. This process is not liner or well-defined. Patience and flexibility are really important.<br />Please be respectful of where you are in the process (some self-compassion can go a long way) and also of where others are.<br />It’s okay to be curious about where your friends, family, and others are in their process and to seek to understand their wants and needs at this time. Don’t forget to tell them what you want and need too!<br />Setting a routine can be really helpful! In addition to doing your schoolwork make sure to schedule time for your physical and emotional health, fun, creatively, social connection, and stress relief!<br />It’s okay to set boundaries, even with family members, friends, and professors.<br />I hope that when reading this you are beginning to see that you aren’t alone in the adjustment process. My wish for you is that you have found some peace in the chaos, and learned something about yourself and the world around you.<br /><br />Pa brainliest po pls <br />Thank you sa points <br />

                        The effects of the COVID-19 panic has caused a massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly. Life adjustments often come with a wide range of experiences and emotions. Sometimes that transition can feel smooth and other times that journey to the new normal is choppy or downright bumpy!<br /><br />Some people may find themselves in survival mode, gathering information and resources necessary to function at school, work, as a person, and in our relationships with others. Others may be attempting to settle into their new routines. For some, this means trying to combat social isolation. For many, it means learning how to live (or re-live) with friends, family members, partners, or roommates, which is not always easy. I hear a lot of people struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. For myself, I feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. I’ve really had to be very compassionate and patient with myself lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting. Some people (and I hope there are a lot of you out there), have gone through the adjustment process and are finding comfort in your new norm. In all of this, here are a few important things to remember.<br /><br />This situation is both uncertain and temporary! It’s okay not to feel okay. It’s also okay (and encouraged) to seek help and support!<br />Consider this a time to reflect on who you want to be during this time.<br />Focus on what is within your control.<br />It’s good to be informed, and it’s a really good idea to take breaks from conversations, news, and information related to COVID-19.<br />Adjustment is a process that looks differently for most people. This process is not liner or well-defined. Patience and flexibility are really important.<br />Please be respectful of where you are in the process (some self-compassion can go a long way) and also of where others are.<br />It’s okay to be curious about where your friends, family, and others are in their process and to seek to understand their wants and needs at this time. Don’t forget to tell them what you want and need too!<br />Setting a routine can be really helpful! In addition to doing your schoolwork make sure to schedule time for your physical and emotional health, fun, creatively, social connection, and stress relief!<br />It’s okay to set boundaries, even with family members, friends, and professors.<br />I hope that when reading this you are beginning to see that you aren’t alone in the adjustment process. My wish for you is that you have found some peace in the chaos, and learned something about yourself and the world<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Discipline begins at home. This is because the home is the first place where children learn and develop their behavior and habits. It is the responsibility of parents and caregivers to set rules and boundaries for children to follow and to consistently enforce those rules. This helps children understand the expectations and consequences of their actions, and teaches them self-control and responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Having discipline at home also creates a safe and stable environment for children to grow and learn. It allows them to feel secure and supported, which can help them develop a positive sense of self-worth and self-esteem. In addition, discipline at home can promote good behavior and manners in children, which can help them navigate social situations and build healthy relationships with others.</p><p></p><p>Overall, discipline begins at home and is an essential part of raising well-rounded and successful individuals. It teaches children the value of self-control and responsibility, and sets them up for success in their future endeavors.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana nakatulong</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Everyone must have a source of inspiration and encouragement in their live. The famous idols like famous singer Agnes Monica, footballer like Christian Ronaldo, and famous actor like Orlando Bloom are some examples of famous idols giving inspiration and positive lives to many. If everyone has a source of inspiration from their idols, but not for me. As for me, my source of inspiration is none other than my beloved mother. My mother is someone who will do anything for her children. She is someone who very important in my life. She always helps and keeps me. No one can’t replace her place.</p><p></p><p>Mother is the most important person in our life. I called my mother, mom at home and everywhere. Now my mother is 55 years old but her look belies her age as most people are fooled into thinking that she is 5 year younger. She is very beautiful with black curly hair. She has black eyes and medium nose. She is rather plump.</p><p></p><p>I could still remember how she embraced me, the soft embraced and her hand which stroke my hair. Every day, I can still smell her perfume. I can still remember how she gently kiss me on my cheek and she leaves red lipsticks marks. I could remember how she always puts me in bed, whispering “shalawat” into my ears, and kiss me on my forehead.</p><p></p><p>My mother has always been very patient with me. She always gives me advises and support whenever I need them. She always in my side during good and bad time. She always lend her shoulder for me to cry on during the bad time. She takes good care on me and my other siblings. She nursed me when I was sick, she always anxious me when I don’t on her side. She angry with me when I do something wrong. She is a good listener when I told my story. My mother is one of the most important motivators in my life. It is because she always encourage me to study hard and always give me a lot of boost.</p><p></p><p>My mother works very hard day and night. It is because she wants to ensure that her children get comfortable life and can study well. That makes her doesn’t think about herself again.</p><p></p><p>Here I would like to thank to God for giving her in my life. No amount of money I can repay for all the kindness and love that she had given for me. I shall always cherish the sweetest memories of her for as long as I live. This memories shall always remain fresh in my mind. My mother is truly a source of encouragement and inspiration. I always love you mom.. </p><br />

                            30. My experience during covid-19 pandemic essay 200 words</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have spent a lot of time finding my new flow. I was the type of student who lived by the saying “The early bird gets the worm." I would often wake up early, get a couple hours of studying in every weekday before classes at either a coffee shop of on campus. I would usually work on assignments between classes, and I would sometimes stay on campus after class to finish up my work. When I went home, I was home, and I did a good job of not taking my work home with me. This is how I found balance, and it really worked for me!  </p><p>When campus had to be closed due to the government’s orders, classes transitioned to Zoom calls. Usually, most course material and class assignments were submitted online, so that part didn't change much, but there was a huge barrier I had to work hard to overcome: being home and doing school work. I had to get creative, so I set up a space in my dining room that acted as my office. I had a really fun time decorating it, putting plants in it for me to enjoy while studying, using candles and crystals to create a focused, calm environment. I bought an adjustable desk that I used to stand during lectures, which was a great way for me to switch things up when I started to feel distracted. I also bought a comfy seat cushion for when I needed to sit and study. I made the most of my classes and maintained my motivation by continuing to check in with my friends in my cohort, and scheduling out my days.  </p><p>Now when I have classes, I usually wake up at 7am, make some coffee, get dressed and have a fueling and delicious breakfast! My “work time” which consisted of Zoom lectures, working on assignments and studying was usually from 8am until 6pm. I would take a break mid-day and go for a nice walk around my neighborhood, often down to Lake Sammamish, and get a quick bite to eat when I got back. After my scheduled work time, I would enjoy time with my partner (who was living with me during the stay-at-home order), usually by cooking a home-made meal, watching a movie, making art and crafting or listening to audiobooks.  </p><p>There was a lot of restructuring and relearning how to be a student during the COVID-19 pandemic, but even with the added challenges and changes to the structure of the University because of COVID-19, the bonds between my cohort and my friends are holding strong. I still was able to get the most out of my classes (something I realized after reflecting on all I had learned during the school year!), and overall I still really value my experience during my second year. I think that speaks to the dedication of the administration, the dependability of the staff, and how invested our professors are. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
