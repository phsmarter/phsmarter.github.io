                                            "The art of communication is the language of leadership." (James Humes) It is a mistake to believe that communication is a simple process. Although people communicate with one another every day, the real question is whether the ideas one has expressed are truly understood by another. Communication breakdowns happen in every part of the globe, and these have led to a plethora of problems. Effective communication can breach peace, spark revolutions, and affect change in government. However, to communicate properly, one cannot simply strive to express oneself and leave understanding to fate; one must also learn how to organize one's thoughts, control one's emotions, use one's words to articulate concepts and arguments, and express oneself in the best way possible. The art of one's communication reflects the art of one's thinking. According to James Berlin (1982), one of the major proponents of The New Rhetoric, "In teaching writing, we are not simply offering training in a useful technical skill that is meant as a simple complement to the more important studies of other areas. We are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it" (776). This is also true when it comes to all the language skills essential in communication, whether this is in writing, reading. listening, or speaking. They are tools that help us analyze, critique, and negotiate with the world. To construct ideas and bring people to believe in one's vision, it is important to be able to communicate in an effective, articulate manner. On a personal level, honing one's communication skills can also bring about success to one's personal and professional life. To lead nations or corporations, communication skills are essential. To work smoothly as a team, communication is indispensable. And to create a vision that people will believe in, one needs to learn how to communicate purposefully in today's society. Questions: 1. What problems can happen when there are communication breakdowns? 2. What does Berlin mean when he says "(In teaching writing), we are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it"? 3. Is this only true for writing? Explain.​</a>

How can you apply the lesson of emotional expression as a function of communication in your strand? Give a specific scenario.4. How might your mood affect your decision - making and communication style?pahelp po salamat​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Non-verbal cues such as emotional expression are an important part of conveying a message. Non-verbal cues often reveal the true feelings of a speaker and can help to clarify the meaning of a message. By understanding the emotional context of a message, it can be easier to interpret the speaker’s intent and to determine the best response.</p><p></p><p>2. Manipulating emotional expression can significantly affect the message. Expressions such as facial expressions and body language can be used to emphasize certain points or to make a message appear more convincing. Conversely, an inappropriate emotional expression can make a message seem insincere or unconvincing, and can make the speaker appear untrustworthy.</p><p></p><p>3. In my strand, I could apply the lesson of emotional expression by being conscious of how I am expressing myself when communicating with others. For example, if I am giving a presentation to a group of people, I could use facial expressions and body language to emphasize certain points or to make my message more persuasive. Additionally, I could be careful to avoid expressing any emotions that might make my message seem insincere or unconvincing.</p><p></p><p>4. My mood can significantly affect my decision-making and communication style. When I am in a good mood</p><strong>Non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions and body language, can be very important in conveying a message. </strong>They can help to add emphasis or emphasis to words, and can also give us important information about the emotions and intentions of the person speaking. In many cases, non-verbal cues can be even more important than the words themselves in helping us understand the meaning of a message.<strong>Manipulation of emotional expression can affect the message in a number of ways.</strong> For example, if someone is trying to convey a message but is not sincere in their emotional expression, it can make the message less believable or convincing. On the other hand, if someone exaggerates their emotional expression, it can make the message more dramatic or attention-grabbing. Overall, the manipulation of emotional expression can have a significant impact on how the message is received and interpreted.<strong>One way to apply the lesson of emotional expression in communication is to pay attention to the non-verbal cues of the people you are communicating with.</strong> For example, if you are having a conversation with someone and you notice that they are frowning or crossing their arms, this may indicate that they are unhappy or angry about something. In this case, you could try to address their concerns or ask them if they need anything, to help improve the communication and make sure that the conversation is productive and effective.<strong>Your mood can have a significant impact on your decision-making and communication style.</strong> If you are feeling happy and relaxed, you may be more likely to make decisions quickly and confidently, and to communicate in a friendly and open manner. On the other hand, if you are feeling anxious or stressed, you may be more hesitant and careful in your decision-making, and you may communicate in a more guarded or reserved way. Overall, your mood can affect both the content and the style of your communication, and it is important to be aware of this and try to maintain a positive and balanced mood to help improve your decision-making and communication skills.______________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day</strong><strong>!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            26. "The art of communication is the language of leadership." (James Humes) It is a mistake to believe that communication is a simple process. Although people communicate with one another every day, the real question is whether the ideas one has expressed are truly understood by another. Communication breakdowns happen in every part of the globe, and these have led to a plethora of problems. Effective communication can breach peace, spark revolutions, and affect change in government. However, to communicate properly, one cannot simply strive to express oneself and leave understanding to fate; one must also learn how to organize one's thoughts, control one's emotions, use one's words to articulate concepts and arguments, and express oneself in the best way possible. The art of one's communication reflects the art of one's thinking. According to James Berlin (1982), one of the major proponents of The New Rhetoric, "In teaching writing, we are not simply offering training in a useful technical skill that is meant as a simple complement to the more important studies of other areas. We are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it" (776). This is also true when it comes to all the language skills essential in communication, whether this is in writing, reading. listening, or speaking. They are tools that help us analyze, critique, and negotiate with the world. To construct ideas and bring people to believe in one's vision, it is important to be able to communicate in an effective, articulate manner. On a personal level, honing one's communication skills can also bring about success to one's personal and professional life. To lead nations or corporations, communication skills are essential. To work smoothly as a team, communication is indispensable. And to create a vision that people will believe in, one needs to learn how to communicate purposefully in today's society. Questions: 1. What problems can happen when there are communication breakdowns? 2. What does Berlin mean when he says "(In teaching writing), we are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it"? 3. Is this only true for writing? Explain.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>it's beautiful answer like and give me star I give u answer </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>breakdowns easy 5 star like</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Communication breakdowns can lead to a range of problems, such as misunderstandings, conflicts, missed opportunities, reduced productivity, and even the breakdown of relationships or the failure of organizations.</p><p>2. Berlin means that teaching writing is not just about teaching technical skills, but also about teaching a way of perceiving, organizing, and making sense of the world. Through writing, one can clarify and refine one's thoughts, develop critical thinking skills, and articulate complex ideas in a coherent and persuasive manner. Writing is thus a tool for understanding and engaging with the world, and for communicating one's ideas and perspectives to others.</p><p>3. No, this is not only true for writing. The same applies to all language skills, including reading, listening, and speaking. Each of these skills enables us to engage with the world in different ways and to communicate effectively with others. For example, reading can help us access and evaluate different sources of information, while listening can help us understand others' perspectives and build relationships. Effective communication thus requires proficiency in all language skills, as well as the ability to use them strategically in different contexts.</p><br />
