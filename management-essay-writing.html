                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>First, we have our physical health. This means being fit physically and in the absence of any kind of disease or illness. When you have good physical health, you will have a longer life span. One may maintain their physical health by having a balanced diet. Do not miss out on the essential nutrients; take each of them in appropriate quantities.
</p><p>
</p><p>Secondly, you must exercise daily. It may be for ten minutes only but never miss it. It will help your body maintain physical fitness. Moreover, do not consume junk food all the time. Do not smoke or drink as it has serious harmful consequences. Lastly, try to take adequate sleep regularly instead of using your phone.
</p><p>
</p><p>Next, we talk about our mental health. Mental health refers to the psychological and emotional well-being of a person. The mental health of a person impacts their feelings and way of handling situations. We must maintain our mental health by being positive and meditating.
</p><p>
</p><p>Subsequently, social health and cognitive health are equally important for the overall well-being of a person. A person can maintain their social health when they effectively communicate well with others. Moreover, when a person us friendly and attends social gatherings, he will definitely have good social health. Similarly, our cognitive health refers to performing mental processes effectively. To do that well, one must always eat healthily and play brain games like Chess, puzzles and more to sharpen the brain.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>sorry po kung di nakatulong 0oints lang po</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Ultimately, Records Management ensures that institutional records of vital historical, fiscal, and legal value are identified and preserved, and that non-essential records are discarded in a timely manner according to established guidelines and identified legislation.</p><p>The main goal of records management is to keep valuable information readily accessible for business requirements as well as compliance audits. For large organizations, it is impossible to track every piece of valuable information with the help of a simple spreadsheet.</p><p>Benefits of Records Management include more effective management of your current records (both paper and electronic); a reduced/eliminated level of record-keeping redundancies; reduced costs for records storage equipment and supplies; and increased usable office space through the elimination of unnecessary file storage. In addition, Records Management provides institutional accountability and timely access to information.</p>Hope This Answer Helps :-)Mark This Answer Into BRAINLIEST ^_^Thanks!<br />

                        <p>Waste management is the managing of waste by disposal and recycling of it. Moreover, waste management needs proper techniques keeping in mind the environmental situations. For instance, there are various methods and techniques by which the waste is disposed of. Some of them are Landfills, Recycling, Composting, etc. Furthermore, these methods are much useful in disposing of the waste without causing any harm to the environment.</p><p>Generation of waste is an important step of almost every industrial activity and in fact, a considerable amount of waste is generated from our homes every day. However, how we dispose it off is something which has larger concerns. The students must educate themselves on the significance of waste management and the technologies available today in order to do it effectively. Hence we have prepared some long essays for students which shall not prove to be informative but shall be helpful for students irrespective of their classes for their examinations as well.</p><p>Waste management is aimed at protection of the environment and to enhance the safety of surrounding environment for humans and animals.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Lifetime weight management is crucial for maintaining overall health and wellbeing. Being overweight or obese can lead to a host of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent these conditions, as well as improve quality of life.</p><p></p><p>Weight management is not just about losing weight, it's about finding a healthy balance that can be sustained for a lifetime. Crash diets and quick fixes may provide short-term results, but they are not sustainable in the long run. Instead, a lifelong commitment to healthy eating and regular physical activity is needed.</p><p></p><p>Lifetime weight management requires a multifaceted approach. This includes a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods, regular physical activity, and healthy lifestyle habits such as getting enough sleep and managing stress. Additionally, support from family and friends can be helpful in maintaining motivation and accountability.</p><p></p><p>It is important to remember that weight loss should be gradual, with a goal of losing 1-2 pounds per week. Rapid weight loss can lead to muscle loss and slow down the metabolism, making it harder to maintain weight loss in the long run.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of lifetime weight management is focusing on body composition rather than just weight. Building muscle mass through strength training can increase metabolism and improve overall health.</p><p></p><p>Lifetime weight management is also beneficial for mental health. Being overweight or obese can lead to low self-esteem and depression. Losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight can improve self-confidence and overall well-being.</p><p></p><p>In summary, lifetime weight management is essential for maintaining overall health and wellbeing. It requires a multifaceted approach that includes a balanced diet, regular physical activity, healthy lifestyle habits, and support from family and friends. Additionally, focusing on body composition and gradual weight loss is more effective and sustainable than quick fixes.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Management is an important part of business for both commercial and non commercial organizations. Management can be described as an act that brings together all resources belonging to an organization including people with the aim of achieving and utilizing them optimally to achieve overall corporate goals.</p><p></p><p>Organizations are governed by missions, vision and values which stakeholders are part of and it thus becomes the duties of organizational managers to plan, organize lead and control various activities and individuals who possess certain talents within the organization in order to ensure that the organization succeeds in its objectives. Effective management theories can be the basis of a success in a business.</p><p></p><p>Management in any kind of organization can learn from the tried and applied management ways. Top leaders are often enthusiastic to adopt the most recent theories in their organization. For instance if the latest change management concept is espoused with a big fanfare, the staff are trained properly, only for the benefits to be accrued insignificant after some time. And when the programs stutter to a stop the management turns its interest to another management craze.</p><p></p><p>Today’s volatile business environment has even made the role of managers within organizations become more imperative and complex hence making the technical and rational depiction of managing differ largely with realities of being a manager. Thus, the level of ambiguity in the commercial environment may require managers to defy logical and textbook descriptions of management descriptions in order to maximize their performance.</p><p></p><p>Organizations are often divided into different functional areas which are similar to sub systems that exist within the entire organization. It is thus the duty of managers to plan, organize, lead and control the various functional areas with the aim of ensuring that the entire organization moves towards the same organization.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Pabrainliest na lang ako ha ≥﹏≤</p><p></p><p></p><br />

</p><p>Essays on Management: Self-management
</p><p>Posted on November 30, 2013 by Peter Winsley
</p><p>“Dreams come true if you want them to, and if you want them to it is up to you.”
</p><p>
</p><p>The lightning tree
</p><p>
</p><p>Self-management can underpin a high degree of self-realisation and self-determination in a job. It requires the ability to manage oneself in relation to others and the wider organisational context, and when this is mastered one has high autonomy. The combination of autonomy, competence and relatedness delivers a high degree of self-determination. This in turn enables you to move from survival to higher forms of self-realisation. Income and its net worth concomitant is therefore a priority threshold which, once achieved, allows you to focus on working for daily meaning not just daily bread.
</p><p>Self-management in a job involves skills and behaviours contributing to both individual and organisational objectives. Self-management is not asocial autonomy and a license to do what you like. Rather it involves autonomy grounded in competence, in contribution to others, and in professionalism.
</p><p>
</p><p>Professionalism involves relatedness to others. It is behaviour that cannot be captured in formal rules but which contributes to organisational purposes. It is unprofessional for example to make someone look foolish in front of an external audience, even though there may be no formal rules against it. Professionalism depends on the tacit mandates people give each other.
</p><p>The most important self-management ability is good manners, and more broadly the ability to work with others. Work is an inherently social phenomenon. Almost no-one works alone effectively. If you can’t collaborate and work with people and get the best from them then you will fail – and no amount of mathematical qualifications, rote learning or computer skills will help you.
</p><p>
</p><p>You will meet lots of rude and obnoxious people in your life – always treat them better than they treat you. Always recognise you are part of a team and this should be reflected in “we” language not “I” Ianguage. It is possible to play a team game in ways psychologically equivalent to working for yourself.
</p><p>Important elements in self-management are self-analysis, and deciding what you want to do in your life. Self-analysis is hard to do but repays the effort. It involves systematic questions that answered create value through behavioural change. What are my strengths? What are my values? What am I interested in? What am I good at? Am I an orchid who thrives best in a specialised hothouse environment, or a dandelion that survives in many different environments? What is my contribution, and what part of it is unique or at least unusual?
</p><p>
</p><p>Self-awareness means knowing when you are stressed or exposed to health risks, knowing when to bend rather than break. It can also mean turning stress to your advantage. Moments of depression can force you to reflect on things, and to change. Sometimes it helps to write down all the good things you have done and all the things you do well.
</p><p>You might also ask yourself what your weaknesses are. There are some minimum threshold competencies needed in the workplace, such as literacy, numeracy and foundational computer skills. If you lack these, you must develop them.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>         Typically, day-old chicks are kept on 23 to 24 hours of light per day for the first few days to make sure that they are able to find food and water, especially water. After that time period, you should reduce the number of hours of light per day. If you are raising the birds indoors, you can give them just 8 hours of light per day.When you open your chicken coop for the day, skim your manure box droppings, and place your chicken manure and any soiled bedding in a “muck” bucket.Composting is the easy, practical solution for manure management. Remove manure from your chicken coop every day and turn it into your compost pile. It won’t smell, and it will be less accessible to flies, mice, and rodents. The manure box effectively catches the bulk of the manure while your chickens are sleeping overnight on their roosting bar.There are many ways to take precautions to help keep your birds as safe as possible from predators. Consider keeping a rooster with your flock who will keep a watch on his hens to alert them of danger. Another possibility might be a Livestock Guardian Dog to help watch out for your chickens.It’s not just that you’ll get “free” eggs and chicken meat, it’s also that the produce from the chickens you keep is known to be free from all the unsavoury “stuff” (including harmful antibiotics and synthetic colouring) commercial chicken eggs and poultry are known to contain.<p></p><br />
