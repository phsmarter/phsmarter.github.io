                                            World literature is the totality of all national literatures. The formation of literature in different countries happened not at the same time, which is connected with the emergence of writing and artistic creativity.Each nation's literature has its own artistic and national features. World literature is very important for studying, still the literature of one country develops together with other national literatures. They enrich each other borrowing certain literary elements. There are a lot of scientific works on world literature, which explain the peculiarities of this phenomenon. As a concept, world literature emerged only in the 19th century when the literary connections of different countries had spread and strengthened.The term "world literature" was introduced by Jogann Wolfgang von Goethe. He used the word "Weltliteratur" in 1827. Goethe studied the characteristic features and interrelationships of different national literatures, the tendencies of their development and their achievements. He studied the works of famous writers awwhich presented different literary phenomena of different historic periods.He claimed that literature shouldn't be restrained by national boundaries. In 1894 the world saw the first book about world literature "The history of world literature. The world literature emerged because of the development of global economic and cultural relations.This global literary process was also caused by the rapid development of national literatures. In the history of world literature, we define several stages of its development such as the literature of Bronze Age, Classical literature, Early Medieval literature, Medieval literature, Early Modern and Modern literature.World literature is the cultural heritage of all humanity. It is essential to study world literature as it helps us understand the life of different people from all over the world, forms our world-outlook and acquaints us with the masterpieces of literature.QUESTION.1.

                                            What is World Literature?World literature is the totality of all national literatures. The formation of literature in different countries happened not at the same time, which is connected with the emergence of writing and artistic creativity.Each nation's literature has its own artistic and national features. World literature is very important for studying, still the literature of one country develops together with other national literatures. They enrich each other borrowing certain literary elements. There are a lot of scientific works on world literature, which explain the peculiarities of this phenomenon. As a concept, world literature emerged only in the 19th century when the literary connections of different countries had spread and strengthened.The term "world literature" was introduced by Jogann Wolfgang von Goethe. He used the word "Weltliteratur" in 1827. Goethe studied the characteristic features and interrelationships of different national literatures, the tendencies of their development and their achievements. He studied the works of famous writers awwhich presented different literary phenomena of different historic periods.He claimed that literature shouldn't be restrained by national boundaries. In 1894 the world saw the first book about world literature "The history of world literature. The world literature emerged because of the development of global economic and cultural relations.This global literary process was also caused by the rapid development of national literatures. In the history of world literature, we define several stages of its development such as the literature of Bronze Age, Classical literature, Early Medieval literature, Medieval literature, Early Modern and Modern literature.World literature is the cultural heritage of all humanity. It is essential to study world literature as it helps us understand the life of different people from all over the world, forms our world-outlook and acquaints us with the masterpieces of literature.QUESTION.1.

                            19. What is World Literature?World literature is the totality of all national literatures. The formation of literature in different countries happened not at the same time, which is connected with the emergence of writing and artistic creativity.Each nation's literature has its own artistic and national features. World literature is very important for studying, still the literature of one country develops together with other national literatures. They enrich each other borrowing certain literary elements. There are a lot of scientific works on world literature, which explain the peculiarities of this phenomenon. As a concept, world literature emerged only in the 19th century when the literary connections of different countries had spread and strengthened.The term "world literature" was introduced by Jogann Wolfgang von Goethe. He used the word "Weltliteratur" in 1827. Goethe studied the characteristic features and interrelationships of different national literatures, the tendencies of their development and their achievements. He studied the works of famous writers awwhich presented different literary phenomena of different historic periods.He claimed that literature shouldn't be restrained by national boundaries. In 1894 the world saw the first book about world literature "The history of world literature. The world literature emerged because of the development of global economic and cultural relations.This global literary process was also caused by the rapid development of national literatures. In the history of world literature, we define several stages of its development such as the literature of Bronze Age, Classical literature, Early Medieval literature, Medieval literature, Early Modern and Modern literature.World literature is the cultural heritage of all humanity. It is essential to study world literature as it helps us understand the life of different people from all over the world, forms our world-outlook and acquaints us with the masterpieces of literature.QUESTION.1.

Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as Great Britain, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[1] Musician Mike Seeger once famously commented that the definition of American folk music is "...all the music that fits between the cracks."[2]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Kuha kalang,</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>5 characteristics of the classical literature are:</p><p>PERSPECTIVE,COVERAGE,ORGANIZATION, AUDIENCE,FOCUS</p><p></p><p>5 characteristics of American folk song are:</p><p> WORK SONG,LOVE SONG,DRINKING SONG,CRADLE SONG,PLAY SONG</p><br />

                        <p><strong>B. Harmony and Texture is homophonic in general</strong></p><p></p><p>A "clearer," "cleaner" style that used clearer distinctions between sections (particularly, a clear, single melody backed by chords), brighter contrasts, and "tone colors" was used in <strong>classical music</strong> (achieved by the use of dynamic changes and modulations to more keys).</p><p><strong>Classical music</strong> has mostly lost favor with the general public in the modern era. Most people associate classical music with dull orchestral pieces performed in opulent concert halls for the benefit of the elderly, elitists, or nerds. The truth is that <strong>classical music</strong> is just another type of music that people can like, and it is just as diverse as today's current music. The <strong>four major periods of classical music</strong>—Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Contemporary—make up the largest category, whereas popular music is made up of a range of genres, including pop, rap, hip-hop, rock, and country.</p><p>However, some music written in the 20th and 21st centuries starts to blur the line between <strong>classical and popular music</strong>, making it difficult to categorize a piece of music as belonging solely to the classical tradition. There is no single way to define <strong>classical music</strong> aside from music belonging to one of these four periods.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For more information about classical music, click the link below.</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5591401</p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><p></p><br />
