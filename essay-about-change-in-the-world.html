1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough.

 If you have ever climbed a mountain, you know how exciting it is to realize you are about to get on top of one of the world’s roofs! Especially for the first time when you do not yet know what to expect or how it is going to be like.I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me. The Carpathian Mountains are not too high. If you compare them to, say, the Caucasian Mountains, the Carpathians look more like hills – although on average, they are about 4500 feet high. Anyways, this is more than enough for a novice, and I am glad my experience of climbing mountains started there.</a>

                            1. persuasive essay about "change the world before it change you"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The world we live in today is full of complex problems that threaten the very existence of humanity. From climate change to poverty, inequality, and conflict, the issues we face are daunting and can seem insurmountable. However, if we don't take action to change the world, it will change us, and not for the better. In this essay, I will argue that it is essential for us to take responsibility and act now to change the world before it changes us.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the world is changing rapidly, and we cannot afford to be complacent. With advances in technology, the world has become more connected, but at the same time, it has become more divided. Globalization has created an interconnected network of people and ideas, but it has also widened the gap between the rich and the poor. This inequality has led to conflict, social unrest, and an erosion of our shared humanity.</p><p></p><p>If we don't act now to change the world, we will be swept up in this tide of change, and the consequences could be disastrous. We must take responsibility for our actions and work to create a more equitable and just world. We need to invest in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and create opportunities for everyone, regardless of their background. Only then can we hope to create a more sustainable and prosperous future for ourselves and future generations.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the world is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis. Climate change, pollution, and the depletion of natural resources are threatening the very foundations of life on this planet. The effects of these environmental problems are already being felt, and if we don't act now, the consequences could be catastrophic. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and food shortages are just some of the challenges we will face in the coming decades.</p><p></p><p>We must take urgent action to address these environmental problems before it is too late. We need to reduce our carbon emissions, invest in renewable energy, and protect our forests and oceans. By changing our behavior and our policies, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for the planet. We must act now to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a healthy and thriving planet.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is essential for us to take responsibility and act now to change the world before it changes us. The problems we face are complex and challenging, but we cannot afford to be complacent. We need to invest in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and create opportunities for everyone. We must also take urgent action to address the environmental crisis we face. By changing our behavior and our policies, we can create a more sustainable and equitable world for ourselves and for future generations. Let us act now, before it is too late.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>words: 464</p><p>hope this helps </p><p></p><br />

                            2. simple essay about what do you want to change in the world​</h2><br />
                        <p>Things I Would Change About the World</p><p></p><p>In today’s society there is so much that I want to change about the world but just don’t have the means or power to do so. So when asked what I would change about the world I had to think very hard about which ones I thought were the most important. The problems that I found were the most important were the one’s that had a rising effect in our society today. The problems that I would change about the world if I could are prejudice, the fear of war, and the pollution humans create on Earth. I will discuss these problems and some ways that we can start to make a step towards change for the better in our world.</p><p></p><p>When I started to think about things that needed to be changed…show more content…</p><p>I think people need to become more aware of the damaging being done and the money that is being spent towards these horrible wars that only bring pain and sorrow. It is hard to make a change with war as it is something that everyday people can not control but there are a few simple things you can do to become involved. A major step is to become involved in today’s politics and be aware of who you are voting for. A way to help those being affected by war is to donate any money, old clothes, toys and perishable food to any major organization. Major organizations create safe spaces for children to go and help children get a start in going back to school. For more information on what you can do to help visit www.warchild.org.</p><p></p><p>Today the Earth and many of its contents, thanks in large part to humans, is deteriorating and it has been for quite a time now. It is overwhelmingly populated with both ignorant and lazy people. In return not much is being done to prevent this deterioration. Pollution caused by humans and their inventions cause a major dilemma. Automobile exhaust fumes and factory pollutants are only a couple of the impurities causing damaging affects to the ozone layer and atmosphere. We depend on the ozone to defend us from harmful UV rays. </p><br />

                            24. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />

                            27. What type of essay is the following text?
 If you have ever climbed a mountain, you know how exciting it is to realize you are about to get on top of one of the world’s roofs! Especially for the first time when you do not yet know what to expect or how it is going to be like.I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me. The Carpathian Mountains are not too high. If you compare them to, say, the Caucasian Mountains, the Carpathians look more like hills – although on average, they are about 4500 feet high. Anyways, this is more than enough for a novice, and I am glad my experience of climbing mountains started there.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Humans have been burning fossil fuels for only about 150 years, yet that has started a cascade of profound changes that at their current pace will still be felt 10,000 years from now, a new study shows.</p><p></p><p>Coastal areas, in particular, will experience the long-term effects as rising seas slowly redraw the world map and continue to rise long after emissions are brought down. Even in a scenario in which global temperatures warm to only about 2° Celsius above pre-industrial times, the analysis shows that several of the world’s coastal megacities will eventually be submerged.</p><p></p><p>That long-term view is important. Policymakers today often discuss climate impacts only through the end of this century. The study provides a new perspective for considering the compounding effects of today’s carbon emissions and what their impact will mean for future generations. It also feeds into international discussions underway this year on whether humans have pushed the planet into a new geologic epoch that many are calling the Anthropocene.</p><p></p><p>“It is becoming increasingly evident that humans have become a geological force of nature,” said Anders Levermann, a co-author of the study and a climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “The emission of greenhouse gases is already changing our climate. If continued, sea level will continue to rise and consume the coastlines and our cultural heritage there for centuries to come.”</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>not mine but hope it's help</p><p></p><br />
