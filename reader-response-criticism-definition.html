Lloyd argue that Alice is a "literally underground image of a woman" battling the "system." Still, they also view Alice's insistence, activity, and curiosity as typically "Un-Victorian" traits that make her an example of a seditious woman.

However, he realizes that this kind of happiness does not exist (“Moral - Examples and Definition of Moral.” Literary Devices, May 28, 2017) ___________10.
