"What Makes a Speech?"In any speech, all these appeals- logical, emotional, and ethical- work together to convince the audience. When using the ethical appeal, the speaker must strike the audience as a sensible, good person if they are to believe his message. In addition to logic, emotional appeal is a powerful means of swaying people, especially groups. Most rhetoricians agree that any argument must be based on logic; that is, it must appeal to the intellect of the listeners. Speeches are not magic. They are not some combination of sorcery and show business. In fact, to win support from an audience, a speaker may use three major appeals: logical, emotional, and ethical.​</a>
