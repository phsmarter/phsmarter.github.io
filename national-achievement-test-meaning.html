Ene 9, 2023 Ang National Achievement Test (NAT) ay isang standardized set ng mga pagsusulit na kinukuha sa Pilipinas ng mga mag-aaral sa Baitang 3, 6, 10, at 12. Ang pagsusulit ay idinisenyo upang matukoy ang kanilang mga antas ng akademiko, lakas at kahinaan, gayundin ang kanilang kaalaman na natutunan sa mga pangunahing asignatura sa buong taon. May passing score ba sa NAT? Ang NAT ay walang passing grade o score. Gumagamit ito ng Mean Percentage Score (MPS) upang isaad ang porsyento ng mga tamang nasagot na aytem sa isang pagsusulit. Halimbawa, ang isang 50 MPS ay nangangahulugan na ang isang examinee ay sumagot ng tama sa 20 ng isang 40-item na pagsusulit sa lugar ng paksa. Ang Department of Education ay nagpahayag na ang National Achievement Test for Grade 12 (NATG12) ay gagamitin simula sa academic year 2022-2023. (DepEd). Ang pagsusulit na ito ay idinisenyo upang masuri ang pagganap ng mga mag-aaral na nagtatapos at matukoy kung nakakamit nila ang mga pamantayan sa pag-aaral ng kurikulum.plss make an article about this about grade 12 NAT like a news paper plsss​</a>

May passing score ba sa NAT? Ang NAT ay walang passing grade o score. Gumagamit ito ng Mean Percentage Score (MPS) upang isaad ang porsyento ng mga tamang nasagot na aytem sa isang pagsusulit. Halimbawa, ang isang 50 MPS ay nangangahulugan na ang isang examinee ay sumagot ng tama sa 20 ng isang 40-item na pagsusulit sa lugar ng paksa.

                        <p>Answer:
</p><p>
</p><p>The sample mean is 18.6 and the sample standard deviation is 0.68
</p><p>
</p><p>Step-by-step explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>1. In any math problem, it is very important to identify what the given information are.
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on what we have:
</p><p>
</p><p>The population mean (represented by the Greek letter μ) is 18.6.
</p><p>
</p><p>The  population standard deviation (represented by the Greek letter σ) is 5.9.
</p><p>
</p><p>The size of the sample/sample size of test taker from Federico Rural High School is 76.
</p><p>
</p><p>2.Let's answer the question.
</p><p>
</p><p>a. Sample mean
</p><p>
</p><p>For the mean of the sample mean of the 76 students, the mean is equal to the population mean.
</p><p>
</p><p>That is, μ (population mean) = μ (sample mean)
</p><p>
</p><p>Since μ = 18.6, then μ = 18.6
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>b. Sample Standard deviation
</p><p>
</p><p>To solve for the standard deviation (σ), use the formula σ = σ/
</p><p>
</p><p>σ = 5.9/√76 = 0.68
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the 76 students who took the National Test from Federico Rural High School are 18.6 and 0.68, respectively.</p><br />

                            21. Exercise 1. Solve and Describe The scores of individual students on a national achievement test have a normal distribution with mean 21.2 and a standard deviation of 1.8. At ABC National High School, 80 students took the test. If the scores of the students at this school have the same distribution as the national scores, how will you describe the sampling distribution of the scores of these students? Assume that the population is infinite.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>the sampling distribution of the scores of these 80 students is expected to have a normal distribution, with a mean of 21.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 0.202. This distribution represents the variability of scores that we would expect to see if we were to repeatedly sample groups of 80 students from the population of ABC National High School.<p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>To describe the sampling distribution of the scores of the 80 students at ABC National High School, we need to consider the characteristics of the population distribution.</p><p></p><p>1. Central Tendency:</p><p>The mean of the sampling distribution will be the same as the mean of the population distribution, which is 21.2. This means that, on average, the students at ABC National High School are expected to score 21.2 on the national achievement test.</p><p></p><p>2. Dispersion:</p><p>The standard deviation of the sampling distribution can be calculated using the formula: standard deviation of the population distribution divided by the square root of the sample size. In this case, the standard deviation of the population is 1.8, and the sample size is 80. Therefore, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is 1.8 divided by the square root of 80, which is approximately 0.202.</p><p></p><p>3. Shape:</p><p>Since the population distribution is assumed to be normal, the sampling distribution of the scores of these 80 students will also be approximately normal. This assumption holds true due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution tends to approach a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, as the sample size increases.</p><p></p><p>4. Independence:</p><p>It is assumed that the scores of the 80 students are independent of each other. This assumption allows us to apply statistical techniques and make inferences about the population based on the sample.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the sampling distribution of the scores of these 80 students is expected to have a normal distribution, with a mean of 21.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 0.202. This distribution represents the variability of scores that we would expect to see if we were to repeatedly sample groups of 80 students from the population of ABC National High School.</p><br />
