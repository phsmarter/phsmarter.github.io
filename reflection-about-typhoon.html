Continue reflecting on managing the effects of tropical cyclones by
the phrases below:
I have learned that the Philippine Area of Responsibility
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration
The Philippines is prone to typhoons because
You can trace the path of typhoons using
You will then understand that landmasses and bodies of
water affect the intensity of typhoons causing it to increase when

We should stay informed about the weather. Public Storm Warning Signals indicate
The higher the PSWS, the

Ano po sagot dito </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>he Philippines is located in the western part of the North Pacific Ocean. This vast area encompasses many countries in Oceania and the eastern parts of Asia. Tropical cyclones can form over warm waters anywhere within this area. This poses a significant challenge to the forecasters in different countries within this region. To make monitoring easy for the forecasters, this large region of the Pacific Ocean is broken into smaller domains called "areas of responsibilities". Here, forecasters will only have to monitor those TCs that are relevant to their country.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PAGASA forecasters use three domains where they monitor, analyze and forecast tropical cyclones: the Philippine Area of Responsibility, Tropical Cyclone Advisory Domain and the Tropical Cyclone Information Domain. These domains can be visualized as "three-layered zones" that enclose the country. If a tropical cyclone is present inside these domains, PAGASA is obliged to provide information about the weather disturbance to the public. Because most tropical cyclones come from the broad expanse of ocean east of the country, the eastern boundary of each domain is farther from the Philippine Islands than the western boundary.</p><p></p><p>GRADE-8 STUDENT LANG PO AKO</p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p>The article is entitled "Braving Storms" because it talks about the resilience and courage of the people affected by Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines who faced and endured the devastating storm.The article says that Typhoon Yolanda would go down in history as one of the strongest and deadliest typhoons that hit the Philippines. It caused massive destruction, loss of lives, and displacement of people. I agree with this observation as Typhoon Yolanda was indeed a tragic event that left a significant impact on the Philippines and its people.The narrator's attitude toward the victims of the typhoon is sympathetic and compassionate. The narrator acknowledges the sufferings and difficulties that the victims faced and highlights their strength and resilience in facing the disaster.The narrator saw the disaster in a positive light because it brought out the best in people, particularly in terms of their courage, determination, and willingness to help others in need. Although such disasters do not happen every day, the narrator points out that people's response to adversity can be inspiring and uplifting.From the devastation caused by the typhoon, the narrator learned the importance of resilience, courage, and hope in facing difficult situations. The narrator also learned the value of empathy and compassion in understanding the plight of others and helping them to recover from the disaster.The school has a special role to play in the aftermath of a tragedy such as Typhoon Yolanda because it can provide support, comfort, and assistance to students, families, and communities affected by the disaster. Schools can also help in the recovery process by providing education, counseling, and other resources to help people rebuild their lives.Edward Said asserts that teachers have a critical role to play in society as they are responsible for imparting knowledge, values, and critical thinking skills to students. He argues that teachers should not just transmit information but also help students to develop their own ideas, perspectives, and understanding of the world. Teachers can also act as agents of change by promoting social justice, diversity, and equality in their classrooms and communities.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It helps us be aware of when it will fall, how bad or good is it, what it's possible to do to your household or community. Watching news about weather forecasts often help people to get ready for any possible storms furthermore not all forecasts are true, if it came from a reliable source then it might be true but when it came from gossips you should not rely on these unreasonable things others say, in addition to this might not end up well, for example your neighbors tells you that there's no typhoon coming but there is a tropical cyclone coming in hours, but you thought that what your neighbors told you was real so you didn't get ready then you probably know what will happen. One more reason of its importance is that it can identify how big or whats theur speed etc. using measjrimg i struments such as barometer, thermometer, anemometer, weather radars and doppler radars. Having to know about typhoons landfalling is a great way to keep your family safe whenever they want to get out, it also avoids danger and spread awareness to all but only if it was from a good source as i mentioned earlier. </p><p></p><p><strong>There</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>no</strong><strong> </strong><strong>right</strong><strong> </strong><strong>if</strong><strong> </strong><strong>there's</strong><strong> </strong><strong>no</strong><strong> </strong><strong>wrong</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>there</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>no</strong><strong> </strong><strong>good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>if</strong><strong> </strong><strong>there's</strong><strong> </strong><strong>no</strong><strong> </strong><strong>evil</strong><strong> </strong><strong>so</strong><strong> </strong><strong>dont</strong><strong> </strong><strong>be</strong><strong> </strong><strong>afraid</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>have</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mistakes</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Hope</strong><strong> </strong><strong>my</strong><strong> </strong><strong>answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>helps</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It's a must to protect ourselves from the typhoon.</p><p>That's why it is important for us to watch news about the typhoon in order to be prepared before, during and after the typhoon. We should be always prepared in times of disaster like typhoons, because being prepared is very essential to survival. People can be killed, injured, or lost during typhoons. Flooding can cause people to drown, houses to be completely destroyed, property to be swept away, and farms to lose all of their crops to the winds and relentless rains.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>BEING PREPARED <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>typhoon</strong> is an adult hurricane that creates somewhere in the range of 180° and 100°E in the Northern Side of the equator. This district is alluded to as the Northwestern Pacific Bowl, and is the most dynamic <strong>typhoon </strong>bowl on The planet, representing close to 33% of the world's yearly hurricanes. For hierarchical purposes, the northern Pacific Sea is separated into three districts: the eastern, focal, and western. The Provincial Specific Meteorological Community for <strong>typhoon</strong> gauges is in Japan, with other hurricane notice habitats for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii, the Philippines and Hong Kong. While the RSMC names every framework, the principle name show itself is composed among 18 nations that have regions undermined by <strong>typhoons</strong> every year.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Philippines get the brunt of the landfalls, with China and Japan being less frequently affected. Be that as it may, probably the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the district, with long term test by means of reports inside their documents. Taiwan has gotten the wettest known <strong>typhoon</strong> on record for the northwest Pacific hurricane bowls.</p><p></p><p>Definition of typhoon:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2013853</p><p></p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
