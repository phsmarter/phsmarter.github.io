                                            First, the essence of technology is not something we make; it is a mode of being, or of revealing. This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes. They have their own way of presenting themselves and the world in which they operate. The essence of technology is, for Heidegger, not the best or most characteristic instance of technology, nor is it a nebulous generality, a form or idea. Rather, to consider technology essentially is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and “requisitioning” of everything around us, and of ourselves. The second point is that technology even holds sway over beings that we do not normally think of as technological, such as gods and history. Third, the essence of technology as Heidegger discusses it is primarily a matter of modern and industrial technology. He is less concerned with the ancient and old tools and techniques that antedate modernity; the essence of technology is revealed in factories and industrial processes, not in hammers and plows. And fourth, for Heidegger, technology is not simply the practical application of natural science. Instead, modern natural science can understand nature in the characteristically scientific manner only because nature has already, in advance, come to light as a set of calculable, orderable forces — that is to say, technologically.​</a>

                                            What is the central theme of Daoism?
Select one:
a. minimal governing: If rulers follow the Dao then their states will be well ordered and in natural harmony
b. effortless action: everything we do should flow with simple spontaneity and without contrivance
c. return: all things eventually decay and return to their ultimate source within the Dao ✔ 
d. primitive simplicity : the ideal, which in practical terms means small farming families and communities
return: all things eventually decay and return to their ultimate source within the Dao ✔ 
The basic idea of the Daoists was to enable people to realize that, since human life is really only a small part of a larger process of nature, the only human actions which ultimately make sense are those which are in accord with the flow of Nature — the Dao or the Way.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In this passage, Aristotle's ethical system of "self realization" is introduced. This system involves a person acting in accordance with their nature and reaching their full potential in order to achieve contentment and do good. A baby is seen as a potential person who needs to realize their inherent potential to avoid frustration and failed goals. Happiness is the ultimate goal, and civic life or wealth are only seen as means to achieve self-realization. It is believed that developing one's talents and awareness of one's nature are crucial for attaining happiness.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            19. First, the essence of technology is not something we make; it is a mode of being, or of revealing. This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes. They have their own way of presenting themselves and the world in which they operate. The essence of technology is, for Heidegger, not the best or most characteristic instance of technology, nor is it a nebulous generality, a form or idea. Rather, to consider technology essentially is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and “requisitioning” of everything around us, and of ourselves. The second point is that technology even holds sway over beings that we do not normally think of as technological, such as gods and history. Third, the essence of technology as Heidegger discusses it is primarily a matter of modern and industrial technology. He is less concerned with the ancient and old tools and techniques that antedate modernity; the essence of technology is revealed in factories and industrial processes, not in hammers and plows. And fourth, for Heidegger, technology is not simply the practical application of natural science. Instead, modern natural science can understand nature in the characteristically scientific manner only because nature has already, in advance, come to light as a set of calculable, orderable forces — that is to say, technologically.​</h2><br />
