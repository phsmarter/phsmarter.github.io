                                            Education is one of the human rights. It aims to inform people to learn new lessons. It is said that every person should have equal quality education regardless of race. At this time, there are also many Muslims in the Philippines. Islam is said to be the second religion in the Philippines. It is obvious that there is a difference in the culture of Muslims and Filipinos from their clothing and speech and beliefs. That's why even in education there is a difference between the two groups.Source? ​</a>

Watch a special report from ABC News "White Supremacist Move Into Town", video is available in YouTube. This person's actions are consistent with his cultural belief that white people are superior. Would a cultural relativist be correct in maintaining that nobody has the moral basis to complain about the white supremacist's actions because he was just following what he believed was right?3. In the Philippines, one moral argument against RH Law is that it violates universal human rights and values such as the right to life and health of children. On the other hand, proponents of the law assert that family planning and sexual education consistent with one's own beliefs and moral convictions is exercising one's freedom to choose. If the basis of universal values is true and, taking into consideration our social problems due to overpopulation, what is your moral stand on the debate about having a comprehensive reproductive health program in the Philippines? ​</a>

                        <p>No, with the educational system the Philippines have, it is only a few students have acquired quality, culture based and complete basic education. It is crucial for every student to learn more in school rather than practice cheating for a competition to class rankings. Most students only acquire lessons they are compelled to study with, and forget about it in the later time. Indeed, it is a privilege of the few as these few students are eagerly instilling the lessons that could help them in the future. In order for students to retain their lessons longer, it is important for a teacher to construct a strategy in order to hone the students' skills and abilities.</p><br />

                            30. 1.How did your community culture influence your behavior? Cite one culture in your community and reflect on a particular behavior you have. Discuss how this particular community culture influenced the development of your particular behavior? 2. Watch a special report from ABC News "White Supremacist Move Into Town", video is available in YouTube. This person's actions are consistent with his cultural belief that white people are superior. Would a cultural relativist be correct in maintaining that nobody has the moral basis to complain about the white supremacist's actions because he was just following what he believed was right?3. In the Philippines, one moral argument against RH Law is that it violates universal human rights and values such as the right to life and health of children. On the other hand, proponents of the law assert that family planning and sexual education consistent with one's own beliefs and moral convictions is exercising one's freedom to choose. If the basis of universal values is true and, taking into consideration our social problems due to overpopulation, what is your moral stand on the debate about having a comprehensive reproductive health program in the Philippines? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: People survive by LOVE, just like all. Community taught me that. I’m just a light trapped in the muck as all of you….but together we can achieve harmony and singular Love. Thanks for letting me share. Hope it helped. It helped me. A community is a social group whose members have something in common, such as a shared government, geographic location, culture, or heritage. Community can also refer to the physical location where such a group lives.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
