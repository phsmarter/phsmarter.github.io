                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The given paragraph seems to be praising the role of a teacher in a student's life and highlighting their importance. However, it lacks coherence and organization as it jumps between different ideas and examples without any clear structure. The paragraph would benefit from a clear introduction, body, and conclusion that present a well-organized argument about the significance of teachers in society.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the paragraph could use some editing to correct grammar and spelling errors, as well as to clarify some of the ideas presented. For example, the sentence "If there had not been teachers there would have not been any doctor, engineer, scientists, t a teacher is not a king but teachers king" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while the paragraph expresses admiration for teachers, it lacks a clear structure and would benefit from some editing and revision.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In my own opinion I think its A. Because Michael was voted by his best friend, diether. It didn't mentioned something about Michael's work being good or anything, it simply just says that Diether voted Michael because he is his best friend, and its either they are teaming to vote for each other's work or he is just being supportive. But still, Diether didn't took time to look for other presentations and just proceed to his best friend's work and I think this is the definition of being biased. I hope this can help.</p><br />
