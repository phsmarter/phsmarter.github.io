PROJECT OVERVIEW Wearing of face masks is recommended as part of protection not only to ourselves but also to the people around us to prevent the spread of corona virus disease. Before the pandemic, face masks were exclusively used in hospitals and other health care units. Nowadays, face masks are essential to everyone. The situation urged learners to be creative, innovative, and resourceful to prevent the accumulation of disposable face masks and resort to washable yet presentable ones. PROJECT MECHANICS (using GRASPS) GOAL You should be able to create a washable facemask with the goal of fostering good health and well-being. Wearing face masks is recommended as part of personal protective equipment and as a public health measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Their use, however, is deeply connected to social and cultural practices and has acquired a variety of person</a>

                                            TEST
Directions: Read each paragraph carefully. Encircle the cue words used. On the blank, write the text
structure.
1. There are many likenesses between my two brothers. Glenn is my eldest brother
whereas Eric is younger than me. Just like Glenn, Eric also attended the same
college. However, they belong to different departments. Glen studied engineering
while Eric studied nursing. Now, Glenn and Eric are both married to their high school
sweethearts.
2. Drug abuse causes multiple problems for countries and communities. The medical
and psychological effects are very obvious. Due to drugs, addicts cannot function as
normal members of society. They neglect or abuse their families. Consequently, they
eventually require expensive treatment or hospitalization
3. School has increased in its difficulty over the years. Initially, in kindergarten was all i
had to do was finger paint, crafts, and daily naptimes. Then during my elementary
years, math went from adding and subtracting to multiplication and division. After that
came junior high with its more advanced math, which also strengthened my
independent study skills. Recently high school has been the most difficult - my
responsibilities have gone from naptime to chemistry equations.
4. Goldfish make the best imaginable pets. First of all, goldfish are extremely quiet.
They don't bark, meow, chirp, squawk, screech, or race around the house while you
and your neighbors are trying to sleep. Second, goldfish are very small and easy to
house. These diminutive animals don't usually grow much bigger than a few inches.
Third, they are very economical. They don't eat much and they don't need to be
groomed.
5. Coming to a new school is hard, so we should figure out how to make new students
feel welcome. New students have to fit in with new class in an unfamiliar place with
unfamiliar rules. This problem can make them feel lonely. In order to make them feel
comfortable, we can help them fit in. We can show them around the campus and sit
with them to eat during recess and lunch. We can also introduce ourselves and get
to know them.

Like the following fare rate for first 4 kms of a modernized PUJ under General Community Quarantine released by LTFRB last April 24, 2020. Distance Fare First kilometer 11.00 Second kilometer 12.50 Third kilometer 14.00 Fourth kilometer 15.50 If we compute the increase of fare for every increase of kilometer distance, they are all equivalent to 1.50. With this, the fare rate is an example of an arithmetic sequence. Aside from examples involving money, identify three situations or three things that you see or observe in your surroundings that illustrate an arithmetic sequence. 10​</a>

Students who regularly spend time playing online games are developing analytical and problem- solving skills that can also help them in their schoolwork. He also said that when you play online games you're solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in math, reading, and science taught during the day (Dockrill, 2012) The Guardian Accessed May 27 2020 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/08/positive-link-between-video-games-and- Computer games have become one of the most important entertainment tools for children, teenagers, and even adults all around the globe. Allowing access to the virtual world with unlimited possibilities, computer games compulsively attract many people. In fact, they have become an integral part of human society (Demirbileka&amp; Tamer. 2010). There are also others that have decreased academic performance in relation to involvement in playing video games. Andersons and Dili (2007) studied video games and aggression and suggested that not only does gaming have impact on perfomance directly, but it also triggers a higher level of aggression, which is often linked to problems in school and decreased academic performance Main Point “为 2 points​</a>

                                            Valentine’s day is approaching. To show our appreciation to our loving grandmother, me and my other cousins are planning to buy a surprise Valentines gift for her. To be able to buy the gift, we should contribute to the amount needed. There are still 3 weeks before the Valentine’s day. My parents will be giving me 50 pesos per day. If I can save 10 pesos each day, in 3 weeks, I’ll be able to earn 210 pesos. However, if I’m going to save 20 pesos each day, then at the end of the 3 weeks, I shall earn an amount of 420 pesos. I decided to save 20 pesos each day. My cousin, Ana suggested to buy a rocking chair for our grandmother. The price of the rocking chair is around 2,732 pesos. Meanwhile, my cousin Mark suggested to buy an inflatable sofa bed instead of rocking chair. The amount of the inflatable sofa bed is around 1500 pesos. I only have 4 cousins, hence, if we choose to buy the rocking chair, each of us would contribute 546.4 pesos. Meanwhile, if we choose to buy the inflatable sofa bed, we only need to contribute 300 pesos. In choosing which one to buy, we considered our savings. Consequently, we decided to buy the inflatable sofa bed for our grandmother.On the other hand, our parents are planning also to have a simple celebration for Valentine’s day. They are currently having a conversation on the amount of money to be used in food preparation and the time needed to prepare all the things needed for the celebration. I heard from one of my Aunts that for them to determine the food budget, they should consider the types of food to be served and the number of visitors. While one of my cousin’s father, told to the group that for them to identify the time allotment needed in the whole preparation, they must consider the number of things to be prepared and the number of persons who are willing to help physically.Rubrics:CONTENT(20 POINTS)20191817161514The four types of variation are evident, and the story has only one themeThe four types of variation are evident, but the story has different themesOnly three types of variation are evident, but the story has only one themeOnly three types of variation are evident, and the story has different themesOnly two types of variation are evident, but the story has only one themeOnly two types of variation are evident, and the story has different themesAny of the four types of variation are not evident TIMELINESS(10 POINTS)10987654Submitted 2-3 days before the deadlineSubmitted on timeSubmitted one day after the deadlineSubmitted 2 days after the deadlineSubmitted 3 days after the deadlineSubmitted one week after the deadlineSubmitted more than a week before the deadline TOTAL POINTS: 30 PATULONG AKO SA MAGALING SA MATH SINO MARANUNG JAN</a>

PROJECT OVERVIEW Wearing of face masks is recommended as part of protection not only to ourselves but also to the people around us to prevent the spread of corona virus disease. Before the pandemic, face masks were exclusively used in hospitals and other health care units. Nowadays, face masks are essential to everyone. The situation urged learners to be creative, innovative, and resourceful to prevent the accumulation of disposable face masks and resort to washable yet presentable ones. PROJECT MECHANICS (using GRASPS) GOAL You should be able to create a washable facemask with the goal of fostering good health and well-being. Wearing face masks is recommended as part of personal protective equipment and as a public health measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Directions: Read each paragraph carefully. Encircle the cue words used. On the blank, write the text
structure.
1. There are many likenesses between my two brothers. Glenn is my eldest brother
whereas Eric is younger than me. Just like Glenn, Eric also attended the same
college. However, they belong to different departments. Glen studied engineering
while Eric studied nursing. Now, Glenn and Eric are both married to their high school
sweethearts.
2. Drug abuse causes multiple problems for countries and communities. The medical
and psychological effects are very obvious. Due to drugs, addicts cannot function as
normal members of society. They neglect or abuse their families. Consequently, they
eventually require expensive treatment or hospitalization
3. School has increased in its difficulty over the years. Initially, in kindergarten was all i
had to do was finger paint, crafts, and daily naptimes. Then during my elementary
years, math went from adding and subtracting to multiplication and division. After that
came junior high with its more advanced math, which also strengthened my
independent study skills. Recently high school has been the most difficult - my
responsibilities have gone from naptime to chemistry equations.
4. Goldfish make the best imaginable pets. First of all, goldfish are extremely quiet.
They don't bark, meow, chirp, squawk, screech, or race around the house while you
and your neighbors are trying to sleep. Second, goldfish are very small and easy to
house. These diminutive animals don't usually grow much bigger than a few inches.
Third, they are very economical. They don't eat much and they don't need to be
groomed.
5. Coming to a new school is hard, so we should figure out how to make new students
feel welcome. New students have to fit in with new class in an unfamiliar place with
unfamiliar rules. This problem can make them feel lonely. In order to make them feel
comfortable, we can help them fit in. We can show them around the campus and sit
with them to eat during recess and lunch. We can also introduce ourselves and get
to know them.

Doing a household chore will give you points and doing more of it will give you more. </p><p>You chose washing dishes.</p><p>For a minimum of 3 things washed, whether it is a plate, a glass, a spoon or a fork, you will be given 5 points. Every additional thing that you wash will be another additional 2 points.

Thus, this is an example of an arithmetic sequence.</p><p></p>For example number 2:<p>You may notice that everytime the minute hands of the clock rotates to the next number, the minutes increase by 5. Suppose it is currently 1:05 PM, meaning the hour hand is at 1 and the minute hand is at 1, and the next time you checked it the hour hand is still at 1 and the minute hand is now at digit 2, the time is now 1:10 PM. This means that for every rotation of the minute hand of the clock to the next digit, the minute in the clock increases by 5. Thus it is a arithmetic sequence.</p><p></p>For example number 3:<p>Suppose you want to fill a 10-Liter Jug with water using a cup which can hold 200 mL of water. Every additional cup of water you add will increase the water in the jug by 200 mL. Sarting from scratch, if you put 1 cup og water in the jug, the water level of the jug will at 200 mL. If you add another cup, you get 400 mL. Add a third cup and the total water in the jug will come up to 600 mL.  A fourth cup will make it 800 mL. This pattern continues. Thus, it is an arithmetic sequence. </p><p></p><p>Check out other questions here at Brainly:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/4527071</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p></p><br />

                            13. Valentine’s day is approaching. To show our appreciation to our loving grandmother, me and my other cousins are planning to buy a surprise Valentines gift for her. To be able to buy the gift, we should contribute to the amount needed. There are still 3 weeks before the Valentine’s day. My parents will be giving me 50 pesos per day. If I can save 10 pesos each day, in 3 weeks, I’ll be able to earn 210 pesos. However, if I’m going to save 20 pesos each day, then at the end of the 3 weeks, I shall earn an amount of 420 pesos. I decided to save 20 pesos each day. My cousin, Ana suggested to buy a rocking chair for our grandmother. The price of the rocking chair is around 2,732 pesos. Meanwhile, my cousin Mark suggested to buy an inflatable sofa bed instead of rocking chair. The amount of the inflatable sofa bed is around 1500 pesos. I only have 4 cousins, hence, if we choose to buy the rocking chair, each of us would contribute 546.4 pesos. Meanwhile, if we choose to buy the inflatable sofa bed, we only need to contribute 300 pesos. In choosing which one to buy, we considered our savings. Consequently, we decided to buy the inflatable sofa bed for our grandmother.On the other hand, our parents are planning also to have a simple celebration for Valentine’s day. They are currently having a conversation on the amount of money to be used in food preparation and the time needed to prepare all the things needed for the celebration. I heard from one of my Aunts that for them to determine the food budget, they should consider the types of food to be served and the number of visitors. While one of my cousin’s father, told to the group that for them to identify the time allotment needed in the whole preparation, they must consider the number of things to be prepared and the number of persons who are willing to help physically.Rubrics:CONTENT(20 POINTS)20191817161514The four types of variation are evident, and the story has only one themeThe four types of variation are evident, but the story has different themesOnly three types of variation are evident, but the story has only one themeOnly three types of variation are evident, and the story has different themesOnly two types of variation are evident, but the story has only one themeOnly two types of variation are evident, and the story has different themesAny of the four types of variation are not evident TIMELINESS(10 POINTS)10987654Submitted 2-3 days before the deadlineSubmitted on timeSubmitted one day after the deadlineSubmitted 2 days after the deadlineSubmitted 3 days after the deadlineSubmitted one week after the deadlineSubmitted more than a week before the deadline TOTAL POINTS: 30 PATULONG AKO SA MAGALING SA MATH SINO MARANUNG JAN</h2><br />
