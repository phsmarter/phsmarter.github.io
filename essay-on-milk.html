                                            essay Fighting Hunger Anonymous A problem our world faces is: How can man provide enough food to feed all the hungry people? All over the world, millions of people go to bed hungry. The great challenge of our times is how to provide food for more and more people. Plant material might be one solution. Some scientists are making "steaks for vegetables Eventually, we cannot afford to raise cattle that eat too much vegetation. It is estimated that these animals use up ninety calories transformed into food. It is preferable to transform vegetation into beef form chemically and give it a meat flavor. One might ask about milk? Where shall our supply of milk come from? Milk can be prepared directly from grass. It need not come from cows. Some scientists are actually doing this. Another approach to fighting hunger is by finding more places where we can grow more food. How can we increase the farmland on earth? We cannot make the earth larger but we can learn to grow food in the deserts and jungles. Some scientists believe that we can even grow tropical fruit underground in Alaska and in the North and South Poles. Special lights may be developed which will give-off ground stimulating rays and if used underground, food and fruits may be grown independent of weather. Only one-tenth of the land surface of the earth is cultivated. Tremendous areas lie barren under the cloudless skies. The land is fertile; there is abundance of sunlight and warmth; but the problem is water. These deserts extend as far as the eye can reach. There are rivers large enough to fertilize these deserts. Man must spread these waters to make the earth more productive. Introduction ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT Body Conclusion​</a>

                            14. essay Fighting Hunger Anonymous A problem our world faces is: How can man provide enough food to feed all the hungry people? All over the world, millions of people go to bed hungry. The great challenge of our times is how to provide food for more and more people. Plant material might be one solution. Some scientists are making "steaks for vegetables Eventually, we cannot afford to raise cattle that eat too much vegetation. It is estimated that these animals use up ninety calories transformed into food. It is preferable to transform vegetation into beef form chemically and give it a meat flavor. One might ask about milk? Where shall our supply of milk come from? Milk can be prepared directly from grass. It need not come from cows. Some scientists are actually doing this. Another approach to fighting hunger is by finding more places where we can grow more food. How can we increase the farmland on earth? We cannot make the earth larger but we can learn to grow food in the deserts and jungles. Some scientists believe that we can even grow tropical fruit underground in Alaska and in the North and South Poles. Special lights may be developed which will give-off ground stimulating rays and if used underground, food and fruits may be grown independent of weather. Only one-tenth of the land surface of the earth is cultivated. Tremendous areas lie barren under the cloudless skies. The land is fertile; there is abundance of sunlight and warmth; but the problem is water. These deserts extend as far as the eye can reach. There are rivers large enough to fertilize these deserts. Man must spread these waters to make the earth more productive. Introduction ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT Body Conclusion​</h2><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>"Random act of kindness"</p><p></p><p>Kindness simply means being good to people around us. It can be done by being polite to them, offering them emotional support, helping them financially, boosting their morale or by simply being supportive to them. Kind words and kind deeds done by us are not only a boon for the recipient but are also a blessing to us. When we help others with their tasks, are polite to them and do other such acts of kindness it gives us a sense of accomplishment and joy.</p><p></p><p>Kindness has been described differently in different religious books and literature in the past. However, they all echo the same thought. All of them advocate that human beings must show kindness to other human beings as well as other creatures. We must be polite, friendly and helpful. While we should exhibit kindness we must not do it with the aim of getting anything in return. Kindness is a selfless act.</p><p></p><p>If God has been kind enough to give us the things we need we must be kind to others and render help in whatever way we can. As Lord Buddha said, “A generous heart, kind speech and a life of service and compassion are the things that renew humanity”.</p><p></p><p>hope it helps :)</p><br />
