                                            Science; Quarter 1 module 2Laws of MotionMotion has been studied for centuries by many great minds. Aristotle (284 – 322 B.C.) for example, believed that a moving object needs a continuous application of force to keep it moving. To him, an object is naturally at rest. He believed that the greater the force on the object, the greater is its speed. He introduced the idea of impetus that keeps a body in motion. John Philoponus (550 A.D.) conceptualized the idea of surrounding force similar to inertia found in Galileo’s idea and Newton’s First Law of Motion. He first introduced “Theory of Impetus”, a concept similar to force. According to the theory, when impetus decreases, the speed of the object also decreases. When that impetus is removed, the object stops moving. Jean Buridan (1300 -1358) also saw impetus as the cause of movement. He further developed the “Theory of Impetus” introduced by Philoponus. According to him, motion is possible through a “mover” that keeps the object moving with power proportional to the speed and mass of the object. When the mover is removed, the object stops moving. He later named impetus as force. Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642), on the other hand, disagreed to Aristotle. He claimed that even without a continuous application of force, an object can continue to move with constant speed in a straight line provided there are no outside forces acting on it. Finally, Sir Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727) used Galileo’s ideas and eventually formulated the three laws of motion.Activity.1.2.3.4.5.​</a>

                            14. Science; Quarter 1 module 2Laws of MotionMotion has been studied for centuries by many great minds. Aristotle (284 – 322 B.C.) for example, believed that a moving object needs a continuous application of force to keep it moving. To him, an object is naturally at rest. He believed that the greater the force on the object, the greater is its speed. He introduced the idea of impetus that keeps a body in motion. John Philoponus (550 A.D.) conceptualized the idea of surrounding force similar to inertia found in Galileo’s idea and Newton’s First Law of Motion. He first introduced “Theory of Impetus”, a concept similar to force. According to the theory, when impetus decreases, the speed of the object also decreases. When that impetus is removed, the object stops moving. Jean Buridan (1300 -1358) also saw impetus as the cause of movement. He further developed the “Theory of Impetus” introduced by Philoponus. According to him, motion is possible through a “mover” that keeps the object moving with power proportional to the speed and mass of the object. When the mover is removed, the object stops moving. He later named impetus as force. Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642), on the other hand, disagreed to Aristotle. He claimed that even without a continuous application of force, an object can continue to move with constant speed in a straight line provided there are no outside forces acting on it. Finally, Sir Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727) used Galileo’s ideas and eventually formulated the three laws of motion.Activity.1.2.3.4.5.​</h2><br />

Families who obey these protocols are contributing to the overall well-being of society.</p><p></p><p>Marxism/Conflict Theory: This theoretical perspective sees quarantine protocols as potentially oppressing certain groups, such as those who cannot afford to quarantine and continue to work. Families who obey these protocols may be complicit in an unfair system that privileges some over others.</p><p></p><p>Symbolic Interactionism: This theoretical perspective would focus on the individual meanings and motivations behind a family's obedience to quarantine protocols. For example, a family may obey these protocols out of genuine concern for their own health and safety, or because they feel pressure from their community to do so.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Proper disposal of garbage and waste segregation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Structural-Functionalism: From this theoretical perspective, obedience to waste disposal policies is seen as necessary for maintaining a clean and healthy environment. Families who dispose of waste properly are contributing to the well-being of their community.</p><p></p><p>Marxism/Conflict Theory: This theoretical perspective might see waste disposal policies as an example of the ways in which corporations and governments shift the burden of environmental responsibility onto individual citizens. From this perspective, families who obey these policies may be unknowingly perpetuating an unfair system.</p><p></p><p>Symbolic Interactionism: This theoretical perspective might explore the ways in which families interpret and respond to waste disposal policies. For example, a family who takes pride in their tidy yard and clean home might be more likely to obey these policies simply because it aligns with their personal values.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Obedience to liquor ban during the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) Policy:</strong></p><p></p><p>Structural-Functionalism: From this theoretical perspective, obedience to a liquor ban is seen as necessary for maintaining public safety during a health crisis. Families who obey the ban are contributing to the overall well-being of their community.</p><p></p><p>Marxism/Conflict Theory: This theoretical perspective might see a liquor ban as an example of a government overstepping its bounds and infringing upon individual freedoms. Families who obey the ban may be seen as complicit in a system that prioritizes control over individual rights.</p><p></p><p>Symbolic Interactionism: This theoretical perspective might explore the ways in which individual family members understand and respond to the liquor ban. For example, a young adult member of a family might struggle to comply with the ban due to social pressure from their peers, while an older member might see it as a necessary sacrifice for public safety.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>REFLEKSTON Ang gawaing ito ay nakatulog sa akin sa pagkakaroon ng makabuluhang sa lipunan dahin</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Training refers to the process of teaching employees the specific skills and knowledge they need to perform their jobs effectively, while development refers to the broader process of enhancing an individual's overall abilities and potential, often through a variety of experiences and activities.</p><p>2. Training is focused on specific job-related skills and knowledge, while development is broader and focuses on overall personal and professional growth. Training is typically shorter-term and more focused on immediate job performance, while development is longer-term and often involves a broader range of experiences and activities.</p><p>3. Companies may struggle to develop managers due to a lack of clear development paths or opportunities, limited resources for development activities, a lack of buy-in or support from top leadership, or a failure to properly identify and develop high-potential employees.</p><p>4. Managers need a range of skills, including strong communication, problem-solving, decision-making, leadership, and interpersonal skills. They also need to be able to adapt to changing situations and be effective at managing both people and resources.</p><p>5. A learning organization is one that prioritizes ongoing learning and development at all levels of the organization. Its features include a culture of continuous learning, a focus on knowledge-sharing and collaboration, a willingness to experiment and innovate, and a commitment to ongoing improvement.</p><p>6. Team development skills are important for executives because they help them build strong, effective teams that can work together to achieve shared goals. This involves developing skills in areas such as communication, conflict resolution, and teamwork.</p><p>7. Situational theory proposes that effective leadership depends on the leader's ability to adapt their leadership style to the specific situation or context they are facing. The theory identifies several different leadership styles that may be effective in different situations, including directive, supportive, participative, and achievement-oriented styles.</p><p>8.
