If I allow my own perspectives on things to get in my way to learning, I am blocking the chance to learn new things from other people. 7. Wilbur Schramm believes on the commonality of experience between sender and receiver. 8. Helical Model of Communication is an example of Transactional Model of communication. 9. Distance between two people may also become a barrier to communication. 10. Listening attentively to the speaker can help solve communication breakdown.​</a>

In fact, lesions to an area of the hypothalamus called the medial preoptic area completely disrupt a male rat’s ability to engage in sexual behavior. Surprisingly, medial preoptic lesions do not change how hard a male rat is willing to work to gain access to a sexually receptive female (Figure 1). This suggests that the ability to engage in sexual behavior and the motivation to do so may be mediated by neural systems distinct from one another.</p><p></p><p>5.the processin of exchanging ideas between the among peoplpeople verbal or non verbal is a communicate</p><br />
