LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                            1.  essay about the love and sacrifices of parents to their children​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A couple's life is based around their little bundle of joy after becoming a mum. A pair turns into a mother and father and what was there before "us" is now "our baby." Parents devote their lifetime actively or implicitly dedicating their time to their offspring. It's also difficult to relax after a long day at work, because little child looks forward to spending the whole day playing with parents. The 'me period' is still out of the parent's calendar. </p><p>This is one of the greatest sacrifice anyone makes as a dad. Emotional Quotient(EQ) is more critical than Knowledge Quotient(IQ) (IQ). A individual who is emotionally secure is happier than someone who is not. Our parents will change their lives for us, but their mental stability will be affected. Some people and occasions are providing emotional comfort in their lives. Yet they can't meet much because of parental obligations. The mental wellbeing of these sacrifices disturb.</p><p></p><p>Our parents should not have to pay for their good deeds because of my interpretation. I guess what makes them proud is that we become upright and accountable people who can take care of themselves. I agree that this will be the perfect way to reward them. Our affectionate parents are old, they are powerless at some stage, and we are going to return favorites and look after them. It is our duty to support us and to fulfill your needs that our parents and guardians raised us up right. Parents expend money to meet all childhood needs. They deliver the best possible education and even go outside their means to offer children better chances. Their investment plans pay a high price for these compromises. Even the great Indian marriage costs a lot for emptying your pockets. If it is a girl parents go so far as to take old-age loans to marry their girl, often with a dowry. A son should share his parents' financial obligations when he is old. But if the son doesn’t earn it is worse for parents in their old age.</p><p></p><p>Parents have unconditional childhood love. With old age, parents become our children and need love and caring. Do not forget, a parent never retires. In today's world, maybe their words of wisdom do not hold significance, but knowledge is the greatest teacher. With all the sacrifices, if a parent has no love and affection, imagine the trauma they're going to experience. The planet is getting smaller, and to grow professionally, we need to travel locations. We don't have to drag our elders around during their old age. It is more than important for them to be proud of their upbringing, just sincere affection and being there when they need us. There's a feeling I'm going to say. It's really real for me, as a daughter, and now as a mum. </p><p></p><p>"The more parenting I go through, the more parents I owe an apology to."</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I love both my parents with all my heart. They are kind people who have taught their children to be the same. Moreover, even when they have arguments, they always make up without letting it affect us. I aspire to become like my parents and achieve success in life with their blessings.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>I love my parents because they take care of me everyday. They loved me ever since I was a child and I could not think of anything else that is joyful more than that. I am very happy because they spend money and work hard just so that I could get what they want and I do not know how to thank them because of they're wonderful acts. They taught me everything I needed to know, especially the struggle and problems I need to face when I grow up. They comforted me when I needed them to comfort me and they did everything for me when I was a child and taught me everything like discipline, manners, obedience, patience, kindness and generosity and especially the magic words. We always need to love our parents because all of the great thing that they have done for us and once we are grown we should do the same for our parents and care for them just like they did when we were all young and also when we did not feel happy.</strong><p></p><br />

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

Your answer</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>     The sacrifices, beliefs, and values parents implant in their children will help determine the person they grow up to be. A child is like a sponge that absorbs their parent's thoughts and viewpoints that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>             Parents make great sacrifices for the care of their children. Day after day, parents protect their children from danger, attend their cries, and reassure their children after a bad dream. Parents give up many necessities for their children everyday. In the poem "Those Winter Sundays" by Robert Hayden, the father displays the sacrifices he makes for this son. The father's "cracked hand that ached", shows he sacrificed pain and discomfort for this child . The father takes no thought for this own confront. Also, self- sacrificing this own warmth so his child could wake up to a warm house. The father would get up in the "blueblack cold", to make a fire . The sacrifices parents make for their children will have an impact on them when they become parents.</p><p></p><p>             Beliefs are taught to children in subtle ways such as just listening to their parent's conversations. It's not uncommon to overhear a child explain something as being absolutely true because what their parents have told them. In the poem "The Victims" by Sharon Olds, the children hated their father because of the beliefs the mother instilled in her children. Their mother "taught us [them] to take it, to hate you..."(830). The children pick up the hate the mother had against their father and this begun the hatred for their father. In "The Death of a Salesman", the father sets a foundation of beliefs for his son. The father believes that all it takes to be successful in life is to be well liked. </p><p></p><p><strong>If you don't like it  or if im  wrong im so sorry</strong></p><br />

Why are schools still not ready to accept students?</p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has surprisingly changed the way people live and work.

                            26. Make an story/essay 200 words about love for our parents.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love for our parents is an emotion that is difficult to describe in words. It is a feeling that is pure, selfless, and unconditional. Parents are the people who brought us into this world and have been with us through thick and thin. They are the ones who have sacrificed so much to provide us with a better life, and it is only right that we show them the same love and respect.</p><p></p><p>My parents have always been my rock, my guiding light, and my inspiration. They have taught me the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. They have always been there for me, supporting me in every decision I make, and guiding me through life's ups and downs.</p><p></p><p>I remember the times when I would fall sick, and my mother would stay up all night, taking care of me. She would cook me my favorite meals, give me my medicine, and comfort me until I felt better. My father, on the other hand, would work tirelessly to provide for our family, sacrificing his own wants and needs for us.</p><p></p><p>Their love for me has been unwavering, and I can never repay them for everything they have done for me. However, I can show them my love and appreciation by being a good son, respecting them, and making them proud. I hope to be able to give back to them in some small way, for all the love and support they have shown me.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the love we have for our parents is a bond that can never be broken. They are our first teachers, mentors, and friends. We should cherish them and show them our love and gratitude every chance we get.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
