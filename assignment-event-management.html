                                            3VALUINGAbraham Maslow said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks likea nail." With the advancement in technology, try to discover by yourself what else youcan use to make everything better than today, then share it for the benefits of otherpeople.Word processors, though a common tool in the workplace can be quite cunning at timeespecially if you are typing a letter or making simple invitations. By doing so, theamount of time you utilize, particularly in Microsoft Word application is onlysuperficial. Imagine working in a company, you host an event like product launchingwhere you will invite 100 customers. The management of the company assigned you tolead the task. How are you going to accomplish this task using the knowledge, yougained in this module? What will be your plan to complete it so your immediate superiorwill recognize your effort?Furthermore, this module discussed another advanced feature of Microsoft Wordwhich is integration of images and other external materials. It tackled how images andother materials are placed within the document and how to manipulate them by usinga layout option specifically, text wrapping. Knowing these features can save you timefrom figuring out how and where to put the image. Now, since it was already discussedto you in this module, do you think that mail merge and image integration can becombined to complete a task, what would that task be? Can you think of reasons for acompany to lessen their expenditures of using it to communicate with customers?You can now take those questions above and share your thoughts using the spaceprovided below.​</a>

This summer, she has been assigned to start her internship as a room attendant in a hotel for three months. Expecting to be an event planner in the future, Ana had a strong feeling that what she did in her internship seemed to be irrelevant to her career objective. She disliked being a room attendant because of the long working hours, low pay, and heavy physical workloads involved.
Suppose you are the internship supervisor of Ana, how would you encourage and help Ana to have a worthwhile internship?</a>

                            9. 3VALUINGAbraham Maslow said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks likea nail." With the advancement in technology, try to discover by yourself what else youcan use to make everything better than today, then share it for the benefits of otherpeople.Word processors, though a common tool in the workplace can be quite cunning at timeespecially if you are typing a letter or making simple invitations. By doing so, theamount of time you utilize, particularly in Microsoft Word application is onlysuperficial. Imagine working in a company, you host an event like product launchingwhere you will invite 100 customers. The management of the company assigned you tolead the task. How are you going to accomplish this task using the knowledge, yougained in this module? What will be your plan to complete it so your immediate superiorwill recognize your effort?Furthermore, this module discussed another advanced feature of Microsoft Wordwhich is integration of images and other external materials. It tackled how images andother materials are placed within the document and how to manipulate them by usinga layout option specifically, text wrapping. Knowing these features can save you timefrom figuring out how and where to put the image. Now, since it was already discussedto you in this module, do you think that mail merge and image integration can becombined to complete a task, what would that task be? Can you think of reasons for acompany to lessen their expenditures of using it to communicate with customers?You can now take those questions above and share your thoughts using the spaceprovided below.​</h2><br />

This summer, she has been assigned to start her internship as a room attendant in a hotel for three months. Expecting to be an event planner in the future, Ana had a strong feeling that what she did in her internship seemed to be irrelevant to her career objective. She disliked being a room attendant because of the long working hours, low pay, and heavy physical workloads involved.
