                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.True2.False3.True4.True5.True6.True7.True8.False9.True10.TrueCHARACTERISTICS OF CULTURE1.Culture is learned. It is not biological; we do not inherit it. Much of learning culture is unconscious. We learn culture from families, peers, institutions, and media. The process of learning culture is known as enculturation.2.Culture is shared. Because we share culture with other members of our group, we are able to act in socially appropriate ways as well as predict how others will act.3.Culture is based on symbols. A symbol is something that stands for something else. Symbols vary cross-culturally and are arbitrary.4.Culture is dynamic. This simply means that cultures interact and change. Because most cultures are in contact with other cultures, they exchange ideas and symbols.5.Culture is integrated. This is known as holism, or the various parts of a culture being interconnected.6.Culture can also be adaptive and maladaptive. This means that humans have biological and cultural ways of adapting to their environment.7.Nature provides the setting in which cultural processes, activities and belief systems develop, all of which feed back to shape biodiversity. THREE(3) FUNCTIONS OF CULTURE1.Culture provides us with design for living. It is always learned and acquired. 2. Culture provides a series of pattern by which biological and socio-cultural demands of group members are met e.g. food, shelter, and reproduction and relationship with group and individuals.3.Culture is the total content of the physio-social, bio-social and psycho-social universe man has produced and the socially created mechanisms through which these social product operate.<p></p>HOPE IT HELPS:)) GOODNIGHT&lt;//3 #CarryonlearningPABRAINLIEST HUHU<br />
