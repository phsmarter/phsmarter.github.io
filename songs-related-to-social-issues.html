                                            Campaign and advocacy are two closely related concepts usually seen in the form of speeches, print-based materials, songs, video clips, and informational advertisements, among others. A campaign, usually social or political in nature, is technically defined as a planned set of activities that people carry out to attain a certain goal or objective. A campaign speech, basically, is a well-planned speaking activity that aims to excite, persuade, and/or motivate listeners convincing them to adhere to the speaker’s ideas. Convincing the listeners can be achieved by employing strong and emphasized persuasive language leaving them with good and impressive points that they can remember. Advocacy, meanwhile, refers to activities that argue, plead, support, or favor a certain cause. Various causes for advocacy usually aim to influence decision making especially with issues involving social, political, environmental, and economic perspectives. While advocacy may be similar with campaign in some points, advocacy speeches present strong points that may either support or contradict existing policies and legal mandates on specific topics or issues.​</a>

                            14. Campaign and advocacy are two closely related concepts usually seen in the form of speeches, print-based materials, songs, video clips, and informational advertisements, among others. A campaign, usually social or political in nature, is technically defined as a planned set of activities that people carry out to attain a certain goal or objective. A campaign speech, basically, is a well-planned speaking activity that aims to excite, persuade, and/or motivate listeners convincing them to adhere to the speaker’s ideas. Convincing the listeners can be achieved by employing strong and emphasized persuasive language leaving them with good and impressive points that they can remember. Advocacy, meanwhile, refers to activities that argue, plead, support, or favor a certain cause. Various causes for advocacy usually aim to influence decision making especially with issues involving social, political, environmental, and economic perspectives. While advocacy may be similar with campaign in some points, advocacy speeches present strong points that may either support or contradict existing policies and legal mandates on specific topics or issues.​</h2><br />
