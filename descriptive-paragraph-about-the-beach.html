                        A place that I enjoy going to is the beach.. It is seen as a place of relaxation because it is normally quiet and peaceful there. To look around you and see the beauty of mother nature at it's finest. The majority of people you ask will say that it is one of their favorite vacation destinations. Not only for the beauty and relaxation but for the sheer entertainment. That is the three reasons I enjoy it as much as I do.<br />             I go to the beach to get away from all my troubles that are bothering me. To feel the grainy sand all under your toes. To sit there under the sun feeling the warmth of it beating down on your skin. To know that if you get too hot that you only have to walk about ten feet down until you get into the brisk cool ocean, and feel instant relief from the blistering sun. Also to lay on a float in the ocean and just feel the ocean as you are a part of it. Not only to feel but to hear the waves is the ultimate relaxation.<br />             The beach is not only known as a place to relax ,but as a place of beauty. Many of times you see artist portraying the beach with their paintings, or by singing about its magnificence and its splendor. No matter how descriptive nor how detailed the picture is though it can never capture the beauty that the beach really holds. Not only above but under the water also. The ocean is filled with many colorful and astonishing marine life. <br />             Some people also go to the beach as a recreational area also. The volleyball nets strung tight as a harp. The hammocks swaying loosely in the nice ocean breeze. The drinks flowing and abundant like Niagra Falls. People always find something fun to do at the beach. It may be; <br />             playing water sports in the ocean, playing volleyball or frisbee on the shore, or just plain relaxing and being lazy by laying in a hammock with a drink in your hand. My preference is the being relaxed and just soaking up the environment around me.<br />

                        Here's an example that was based on my beach trip in Palawan:<br /><br />It was the middle of school year where my family and I had our Palawan tour. I got excited because I had a chance to skip school for a week. Fast forward to the landing in Palawan. I spent a day in a public beach where there were only few people on the beach. I was ecstatic to finally swim in the blue water. The sound of waves crashing and coming to the sandy shore. <br /><br />I took my slippers off and ran straight into the water. I was greeted with the cold salty water as I plunged my face underwater. I spent the entire day floating and basking the sun's warm rays. When evening came it was time to head back to the hotel where I ordered a hamburger, it was a good burger and I had a nice beach vacation. <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I’m going to discuss mountains first. The three aspects I’m going to discuss are climate, types of activities and location. Climate is always important in order to enjoy vacations. If a person dislikes cold weather, he or she might have a hard time in the mountains. The cold climate in the mountains is the first barrier to enjoying them, but the climate and the temperature of these zones also determine the types of activities they offer. Snow boarding, mountain climbing, mountain biking, hiking, and skiing are some activities people can enjoy when going to the mountains. There are many regions that have mountains where people can go and have a great vacation. Canada is a country located in North America and contains many mountain vacation sites where people can go and have fun.</p><p>           I’m going to discuss the beach second. The three aspects I’m going to discuss are climate, types of activities and location. Warm climate is one of the most important features that the beach has. Sun and fun are two words that describe the beach. The temperature in those places is always hot. The sea and the warm climate determine the activities that are available at the beach. People can swim, play volleyball, play soccer, and ride water bikes. In most coastal sites, there are discos and restaurants where people can dance or party throughout the night. Mexico offers many amazing coastal sites to visit. Acapulco and Cancun are two of the most beautiful and famous beaches in the word. </p><p>             It doesn’t matter what place a person decides to choose. The fun is 100% guaranteed. People often choose one of these two options to spend their vacations. Depending on what the person likes is what he or she will choose. I like the beach better than the mountains, but sometimes it is better to take a risk and try a different place to enjoy. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A day at the beach is a perfect way to enjoy the sun, sea, and sand. The salty sea air, the sound of crashing waves, and the feeling of the warm sand between your toes all contribute to the relaxing and rejuvenating experience. Whether you're swimming in the ocean, lounging on a beach chair, or playing beach volleyball with friends, there's something for everyone to enjoy. It's also an opportunity to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of daily life and soak up the natural beauty around you. The beach is a perfect place to spend time with family and friends, have a picnic or barbecue, and create lasting memories. And, at the end of the day, watching the sun dip below the horizon and painting the sky with warm oranges and pinks is an unforgettable experience. A day at the beach is a perfect way to unwind, recharge, and enjoy the simple pleasures of life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS ^√^</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The beaches in El Nido are breathtakingly beautiful, attracting countless visitors from around the world every year. However, the massive influx of tourists has also had a significant impact on the environment. The increase in tourism has led to overcrowding and pollution, with litter and waste scattered along the beaches and in the water. This, in turn, has led to a decline in the health of the marine ecosystem, affecting the flora and fauna that call the beaches home.
