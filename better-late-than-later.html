                                            ACTIVITY 2 DIRECTIONS: Using the Venn diagram, compare and contrast Washington DC and London.Both Washington, DC, and London are capital cities of English-speaking countries, and yet they offer vastly different experiences to their residents and visitors. Comparing and contrasting the two cities based on their history, their culture, and their residents show how different and similar the two are. Both cities are rich in world and national history, though they developed on very different time lines. London, for example, has a history that dates back over two thousand years. It was part of the Roman Empire and known by the similar name, Londinium. It was not only one of the northernmost points of the Roman Em- pire but also the epicenter of the British Empire where it held significant global influence from the early sixteenth century on through the early twentieth century. Washington, DC, on the other hand, has only formally existed since the late eighteenth century. Though Native Americans inhabited the land several thousand years earlier, and settlers inhabited the land as early as the six- teenth century, the city did not become the capital of the United States until the 1790s. From that point onward to today, however, Washington, DC, has increasingly maintained significant global influence. Even though both cities have different histories, they have both held, and continue to hold, significant social influence in the economic and cultural global spheres.as well as a similar amount of global and national chains. While London may be better known for its pubs and taste in beer, DC offers a different bar-going experience. With clubs and pubs that tend to stay open later than their British counterparts, the DC night life tend to be less reserved overall. ​</a>

Iking : Yes. Here’s a letter for your father. It must be from your brother Efren. It came from Manila. Here. Take it.
Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?

Pedro : Later, Gardo. Read this letter to me first because I left my reading glasses at home.
Gardo : This must have come from Efren.
Pedro : How do you know?
Efren : “... and I want so much to go back home. The only thing that sustains me in my loneliness is the thought that someday, I will be able to help you lift our family from the poverty we have endured for so long. I shall always be grateful to you, Father.”
Efren : “Please give my love to Mother, Delia, Ninay and Kuya Gardo. You are always on my mind and in my heart...”

Pedro : Yes. (softly) Efren is a good son, Sepa.
Sepa : Now, tell me why you were angry when you came home from the fields, Pedro. Do you have a problem?
Pedro : Problem? Oh, no. I don’t have a problem. Let’s just say that there was a little miscommunication earlier. But that has been corrected now.

                            7. ACTIVITY 2 DIRECTIONS: Using the Venn diagram, compare and contrast Washington DC and London.Both Washington, DC, and London are capital cities of English-speaking countries, and yet they offer vastly different experiences to their residents and visitors. Comparing and contrasting the two cities based on their history, their culture, and their residents show how different and similar the two are. Both cities are rich in world and national history, though they developed on very different time lines. London, for example, has a history that dates back over two thousand years. It was part of the Roman Empire and known by the similar name, Londinium. It was not only one of the northernmost points of the Roman Em- pire but also the epicenter of the British Empire where it held significant global influence from the early sixteenth century on through the early twentieth century. Washington, DC, on the other hand, has only formally existed since the late eighteenth century. Though Native Americans inhabited the land several thousand years earlier, and settlers inhabited the land as early as the six- teenth century, the city did not become the capital of the United States until the 1790s. From that point onward to today, however, Washington, DC, has increasingly maintained significant global influence. Even though both cities have different histories, they have both held, and continue to hold, significant social influence in the economic and cultural global spheres.as well as a similar amount of global and national chains. While London may be better known for its pubs and taste in beer, DC offers a different bar-going experience. With clubs and pubs that tend to stay open later than their British counterparts, the DC night life tend to be less reserved overall. ​</h2><br />

Ninay : I was standing behind the bushes. That is why you didn’t see me. Is there any letter for us, Mang Iking?
Iking : Yes. Here’s a letter for your father. It must be from your brother Efren. It came from Manila. Here. Take it.
Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?
Ninay : Yes. He wants to be an engineer and I’m sure he will be someday!
Iking : Alright, I have to leave now. I still have a lot of letters to deliver. Goodbye, Ninay.
Ninay
Later. . . : Goodbye, Mang Iking. Thank you again!
Ninay : Mother asked me to bring your lunch, Father.
Pedro : Where is she? I thought she’d bring lunch herself.

Ninay : Goodbye.
Gardo : Shall we eat now, Father?
Pedro : Later, Gardo. Read this letter to me first because I left my reading glasses at home.
Gardo : This must have come from Efren.
Pedro : How do you know?
Efren : “... and I want so much to go back home. The only thing that sustains me in my loneliness is the thought that someday, I will be able to help you lift our family from the poverty we have endured for so long. I shall always be grateful to you, Father.”
Efren : “Please give my love to Mother, Delia, Ninay and Kuya Gardo. You are always on my mind and in my heart...”
Sepa : “. . . Efren.” He is such a good son.
Pedro : Yes. (softly) Efren is a good son, Sepa.
Sepa : Now, tell me why you were angry when you came home from the fields, Pedro. Do you have a problem?
Pedro : Problem? Oh, no. I don’t have a problem. Let’s just say that there was a little miscommunication earlier. But that has been corrected now.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The letter is from Efren, the son who is studying in Manila, and it contains his message of love and gratitude towards his family, particularly his father who has endured poverty for so long.The eldest son, Gardo, interpreted the letter positively and with a proud tone of voice. He was not jealous of his brother and instead, he seemed to admire Efren's dedication to his studies and his desire to help lift their family from poverty.The mother, Sepa, interpreted the letter with a loving and emotional tone of voice. She expressed her admiration for Efren's character and considered him a good son. While not all mothers may react in the same way, it is common for parents to feel proud and emotional when receiving messages from their children who are away from home.Both interpretations are valid and can be considered close to Efren's intention. The letter expresses Efren's love and gratitude towards his family, as well as his determination to succeed and help his family overcome poverty. It is possible that Efren intended to convey both the positive emotions and the message of hope for a better future that his family can have with his success.Both interpretations are likable, as they show different perspectives and emotions that can arise from reading a letter from a loved one who is far away. However, the interpretation that focuses on Efren's determination to succeed and help his family can be particularly inspiring and hopeful for others who may also be struggling with poverty or other challenges in their lives.<p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>google nyo po para malaman mo</p><br />
