                            1. Write an Essay about Holy week and for you what is the meaning of Holy Week(250-300 words)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Holy Week, in the Christian church, the week between Palm Sunday and Easter, observed with special solemnity as a time of devotion to the Passion of Jesus Christ. In the Greek and Roman liturgical books, it is called the Great Week because great deeds were done by God during this week. During Holy Week, Christians recall the events leading up to Jesus' death by crucifixion and, according to their faith, his Resurrection. The week includes five days of special significance. The first is Palm Sunday, which commemorates Jesus' humble entry (on a donkey) into Jerusalem to observe Passover. Christians remember it as the day of the Last Supper, when Jesus washed the feet of his disciples and established the ceremony known as the Eucharist. The night of Maundy Thursday is the night on which Jesus was betrayed by Judas in the Garden of Gethsemane. Good Friday is celebrated to commemorate the day Jesus Christ was crucified. Good Friday is considered holy because on this day Jesus Christ sacrificed his life out of love for everyone and while suffering for the sins of humanity. On this day Christians commemorate the passion, or suffering, and death on the cross of Jesus Christ. Many Christians spend Good Friday in fasting, prayer, repentance, and meditation on the agony and suffering of Christ. The Three Hours' Devotion based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross begins at noon and ends at 3 pm, the time that the Christian tradition teaches that Jesus died on the cross. Holy Saturday commemorates the day that Jesus Christ lay in the tomb after his death, according to the Christian bible. It is the day after Good Friday and the day before Easter Sunday. It is also known as Easter Eve, Easter Even, Black Saturday, or the Saturday before Easter. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and most mainline Protestant churches teach that Jesus descended to the realm of the dead on Holy Saturday to save righteous souls, such as the Hebrew patriarchs, who died before his crucifixion. Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament of the Bible, the event is said to have occurred three days after Jesus was crucified by the Romans and died in roughly 30 A.D. For Christians, the resurrection is the belief that Jesus came back to life three days after he died on the cross. The Gospel of Luke (24:1–9) explains how Jesus' followers found out that he had been resurrected: On the Sunday after Jesus' death, Jesus' female followers went to visit his tomb. Easter Sunday is not generally accepted as a part of Holy Week or the Lenten season. Instead, Easter starts the roughly 50-day religious season of “Eastertide” and is considered a festal time in some churches.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Paki brainliest naman. kawawa brain cells ko dun ah. ang haba hehe sana makatulong</p><br />

It is a period of reflection and contemplation, as well as a time for celebration and renewal. The week begins on Palm Sunday and ends on Easter Sunday, with each day holding its own significance and meaning.</p><p></p><p>On Palm Sunday, Christians celebrate Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem. This is symbolized by the waving of palm branches and the laying of coats on the ground to welcome him. The crowd's excitement and anticipation on this day foreshadow the events that are to come during the rest of the week.</p><p></p><p>The following days of Holy Week are marked by solemnity and reflection. On Maundy Thursday, Christians commemorate the Last Supper, during which Jesus shared bread and wine with his disciples and instituted the sacrament of the Eucharist. It was also on this night that Jesus was betrayed by Judas and arrested by the authorities.</p><p></p><p>Good Friday is perhaps the most somber day of Holy Week, as Christians remember the crucifixion of Jesus. Many churches hold services on this day that focus on the passion of Christ, including the reading of the Gospel accounts of his trial and execution. Some Christians also fast or abstain from meat on this day as a sign of penance and sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>On Holy Saturday, the Church enters into a period of waiting and reflection. It is a day of silence and stillness, as Christians remember the darkness and despair that followed Jesus' death. Many churches hold vigils or prayer services on this day, preparing for the joyous celebration of Easter that is to come.</p><p></p><p>Finally, on Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus. This is the cornerstone of Christian faith, the belief that Jesus conquered death and rose from the dead. Churches are often filled with flowers and decorations on this day, and many Christians attend special services or Masses to celebrate the Resurrection.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Holy Week is a time of great significance and meaning for Christians around the world. It is a time of reflection, penance, and joy, as we remember the events that led to Jesus' death and celebrate his Resurrection. Through the rituals and traditions of Holy Week, Christians are able to deepen their faith and renew their commitment to living a life of love and service to others.</p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Holy Week Essay </strong></p><p><strong>La Semana Santa or known as Holy Week is referred to as "Great and Holy Week". Holy Week in Christianity is the last week of Lent and the week before Easter.Holy Week in the Christian year is the week immediately before Easter. Holy Week begins with what is now called Palm Sunday.The Chrism Mass, whose texts the Roman Missal now gives under Holy Thursday, may be brought forward to one of these days, to facilitate participation by as many as possible of the clergy of the diocese together with the bishop.When the principal services of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil were celebrated in the morning, the office of Matins and Lauds of each day was celebrated on the evening of the preceding day in the service known as Tenebrae. The liturgy consists of three parts, the Liturgy of the Word, the Veneration of the Cross, and Holy Communion. On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting the Resurrection. The Liturgy begins after sundown on Holy Saturday as the crowd gathers inside the church. Holy Week has developed into one of Brazil's main symbols of community identity, more significant in the southern town of Campanha. The Campanha Holy Week begins on the Monday evening with the Procession of the Deposit. Holy Week in Guatemala incorporates processions with images of saints carried on wooden platforms.</strong></p><p><strong>Holy Week is important as it reminds Christians of God's sacrifice of his son, and also God's love for his people. Christians can learn much about Jesus through the last week of his life. Easter is the most important festival in the Christian calendar.</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>During Holy Week, Christians recall the events leading up to Jesus’ death by crucifixion and, according to their faith, his Resurrection. The week includes five days of special significance. The first is Palm Sunday, which commemorates Jesus’ humble entry (on a donkey) into Jerusalem to observe Passover. According to the Gospel account, he was greeted by crowds of people who spread their cloaks and laid palm leaves in his path and proclaimed him the Son of David (Matthew 21:5). In many Christian churches Palm Sunday is celebrated with a blessing and procession of palms. Maundy Thursday marks Jesus’ institution at the Last Supper of the Eucharist, thereafter a central element of Christian worship. In Roman Catholicism, Maundy Thursday is accompanied by the pope’s washing of the feet of 12 humble or poor persons, in imitation of Jesus’ washing of the feet of his 12 disciples at the Last Supper. Good Friday commemorates Jesus’ suffering and death on the cross; it is traditionally a day of sorrow, penance, and fasting. Holy Saturday, also called Easter Vigil, is the traditional end of Lent. Easter Sunday is the celebration of Jesus’ Resurrection, according to the Gospels, on the third day after his crucifixion. The modern observance of Easter, like that of Christmas, has become associated with various folk traditions that have little connection with the religious celebration; they include the Easter lamb, the Easter rabbit, and the painting of Easter eggs.</p><br />

It is a time to be close to God, express our gratitude, and seek forgiveness. Through cohesive devices like 'Firstly,' 'Secondly,' 'Thirdly,' 'Fourthly,' 'Finally,' and others, I was able to organize my thoughts and express them coherently. The experience of observing Holy Week this year was different due to the pandemic, but it did not diminish the spiritual significance and the opportunities for prayer and reflection.</p><br />
