                                            What is It Assessing literature Literature from the Period of Emergence and Development shows a significant trend as Filipino writers become more competent in the English language and gain mastery in patriotic and resistance literature. Recall the Ifugao folk song, "After Harvest." Details and images like laugh and shout, dance and sing show the attitude of Filipinos, as they celebrate after a long day of hard work. The setting of the poem also suggests that the event transpired in a rice field, which is a common sight in Ifugao. In this selection, one can also imply that the characters' livelihood depends on rice crops.​</a>

Directions: Identify Pautasso's suggested ten rules in writing a literature review: Write the answer on the space provided before the number. a 1. The topic must be a well-defined topic that is interesting to you and your readers. 2. Reading other literature reviews from other papers may give you other literature to read and gain information from. 3. It is recommended that you read articles first before starting your literature review so that you could make sense of what the literature says of your chosen topic. This helps you organize the ideas you have read and helps you avoid irrelevant and confusing statements. 4. This has been covered in the previous modules. Choosing the kind of literature review you wish to write will help you structure your sentences and ideas into one coherent form. -5. While you are making the literature review to find answers to your chosen topic or research problem, you can also discuss similar or related issues through it. 6. It is not enough that you summarize the literature you read, try to understand how it differs from the setting and background of the study you are pursuing. Take note of what it lacked or the aspects which can be improved through your own study. 7. In order for a literature review to make sense, it must follow not only a chronological progression of ideas but also of a logical progression. Discuss the problem from its probable causes, continuing on to the current understanding and present solutions for it. After that, you can present your view or proposed solution. _8. Try having a fellow student read your literature review and see if it makes sense to him or her. The reader can point out places where the review has become confusing and thus needs improvement. 9. If you have made research at the same field before, you can cite your own work. However, be careful not to place too much emphasis on your previous research make it seem as it is more important than other sources that you collected. 10. Older studies give a perspective on the problem during a different tim setting.

A feminist literary critic resists traditional assumptions while reading a text.29.

Describing relationships between the literary text and ideas about power and sexuality andgender is another method of feminist literary approach.33. The purpose of critical approaches to literary criticism is to help us answer the questions what,why and how do we read.34.
