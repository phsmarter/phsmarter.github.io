                                            Read the example of a descriptive essay below.My Mother, My Strength!My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with asweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, thefeeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. Sheteaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raisingme up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I wasyoung because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than aprofessional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for herteaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in theInternet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom dealswith them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this.Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which Ienvy.They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes. My mom isthe dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.Answer the following questions. 1.what did the writer compare her mother with?2.write at least three sentences that described the mother based on the essay.3.Based on the given example,what is descriptive essay?

For example, you can look at the gender variable, where the grouping is generally only into two, namely male  and female which are coded 1 and 2.</p><p> The number only serves as a category label, without having a numeric value like a true number.  These numbers do not have the same properties as numbers in general, so that on variables with a nominal scale, mathematical operations such as subtraction, addition, multiplication, etc. cannot be applied.</p><p> 2. <strong>Ordinal scale</strong></p><p> The ordinal scale is one type of measurement scale where the number symbols of the measurement results are in the form of a sequence or level.  Appropriate statistical tests are mode, median, frequency distribution and non-parametric statistics such as rank order correlation.</p><p> 3. <strong>Interval Scale</strong></p><p> Is a type of measurement scale that has characteristics similar to the ordinal scale, which has a certain order.  Another characteristic inherent in the interval scale is the existence of a scale unit.  Appropriate statistical tests are all statistical tests except those that are based on ratios such as the coefficient of variation.</p><p> 4. <strong>Ratio scale</strong></p><p> Ratio scale is a type of measurement scale that produces data of the highest quality.  The difference between the ratio scale and the interval scale lies in the presence of a zero value (based value).  On a ratio scale, zero is absolute, unlike on an interval scale.  The data generated by the ratio scale is ratio data.  There are no restrictions on the appropriate statistical test tools.</p><p></p><p> Learn information regarding level of measurements at https://brainly.ph/question/14034954.</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1,The most important stage of the teaching cycle is the assessment stage. Assessment provides teachers with the opportunity to evaluate the learning outcomes of their students and identify areas of strengths and weaknesses. It is through assessment that teachers can make informed decisions on how to improve their teaching practice and design instructional strategies that better suit the needs of their learners. Assessment also helps teachers to adjust their teaching methods to cater for individual differences and to ensure that their learners are progressing towards the learning goals.</p><p></p><p>2,The best teaching strategy to be used in the intermediate grades with special needs is differentiated instruction. This strategy involves tailoring teaching methods and materials to suit the individual learning needs and preferences of students. In this approach, the teacher provides multiple ways for students to access the curriculum and encourages them to work at their own pace. Differentiated instruction also involves using a variety of teaching methods such as visual aids, cooperative learning, and hands-on activities to engage learners.</p><p></p><p>3,To apply constructivism in teaching mathematics, teachers should adopt a student-centered approach to learning. They should encourage students to actively participate in their learning by providing them with opportunities to explore mathematical concepts, ask questions, and share their ideas with others. Teachers should also use real-world examples and scenarios to make the learning more relevant and engaging for students. Furthermore, teachers should encourage students to work collaboratively, providing them with opportunities to discuss and solve problems together.</p><p></p><p>4,One of the possible challenges in using constructivism in teaching mathematics is the need for careful planning and preparation. Teachers must design activities and lessons that allow students to explore and construct their own knowledge while ensuring that the learning outcomes are aligned with the curriculum goals. Another challenge is managing the different learning needs and preferences of students in a constructivist classroom. Teachers must be able to adapt their teaching methods to cater for individual differences and provide support and scaffolding when needed.</p><p></p><p>5,Mathematics anxiety is a psychological condition that affects a person's ability to learn and perform mathematical tasks. It can be caused by a number of factors, including negative experiences in math class, a lack of confidence in one's ability, and a fear of failure. During a mathematics anxiety episode, students may view math as a difficult subject, their math class as a place of fear and anxiety, and their math teacher as someone who may judge or criticize them. It is important for teachers to create a supportive and positive learning environment that encourages students to take risks and make mistakes without fear of judgment or criticism.</p><br />

                            15. Read the example of a descriptive essay below.My Mother, My Strength!My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with asweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, thefeeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. Sheteaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raisingme up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I wasyoung because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than aprofessional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for herteaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in theInternet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom dealswith them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this.Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which Ienvy.They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes. My mom isthe dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.Answer the following questions. 1.what did the writer compare her mother with?2.write at least three sentences that described the mother based on the essay.3.Based on the given example,what is descriptive essay?

                        <p></p>Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Socialization is the process by which individuals learn and internalize the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture. These two concepts are related because socialization occurs within an ecological context, which influences the development and behavior of individuals.Socialization is the process by which individuals acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values that are necessary to function effectively in society. It is closely related to development and adaptation because socialization plays a key role in shaping an individual's personality, beliefs, and behaviors, which in turn affect their ability to adapt to different social contexts.The key assumptions of Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory are that human development is shaped by the interaction between the individual and the environment, and that this interaction occurs at multiple levels, including the microsystem (immediate environment), mesosystem (interactions between different microsystems), exosystem (external environment), and macrosystem (cultural context).The process of socialization in an ecological context involves the interaction between the individual and their immediate environment (microsystem), which includes family, peers, and other social groups. These interactions shape the individual's beliefs, values, and behaviors, and can have a significant impact on their development and adaptation.The ecological theory is useful in understanding the role of the teacher and the community in the learning of children in schools because it recognizes that development occurs within a broader ecological context. Teachers and community members play a critical role in shaping the microsystems in which children are socialized, and can have a significant impact on their academic achievement and social-emotional development. By understanding the ecological factors that influence learning, educators can design more effective interventions and support systems for children.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I believe the most important stage of the teaching cycle is the assessment stage. Assessment is essential in determining whether the desired learning objectives have been achieved. Assessment helps teachers understand learning better and gain insight on how to improve the student’s experience and the learning environment. Assessment also encourages student feedback, which can provide valuable information on how to further refine the teaching process. This stage allows teachers to measure success, track student progress and make necessary adjustments to ensure the students are reaching their full potential.</p><p></p><p>2. The best teaching strategy to be used in the intermediate grades with special needs is one that emphasizes positive reinforcement and gives students an opportunity to practice their new skills. Teachers should use a variety of teaching methods, such as scaffolding, small group activities, and differentiated instruction, to ensure that all students receive an appropriate level of challenge and support. It is important to provide the students with frequent and timely feedback so they can immediately track their progress and understand where they are in terms of meeting the desired learning objectives. Additionally, teachers should consciously create a learner-centered atmosphere that values and respects each student’s individual needs.</p><p></p><p>3. To apply constructivism in teaching mathematics, teachers should create a learning environment that allows students to explore and discover mathematical principles. Constructivist teaching methods such as inquiry-based learning should be employed in order to engage the students in problem-solving activities. For example, teachers can start with a problem or an issue, and then allow the students to discuss the various options and create solutions in order to reach a common goal. Additionally, teachers should create activities in which students can make mistakes and receive feedback, which is essential to constructivist learning and encourages collaboration and communication.</p><p></p><p>4. The biggest challenge in using constructivism when teaching mathematics is getting students to be actively involved in the learning process and move away from being passive recipients of knowledge. Additionally, students may feel overwhelmed by the more open-ended nature of constructivist teaching and the associated lack of structure and guidance. Furthermore, since constructivist teaching necessitates that students work through problems on their own and in groups, there are potential difficulties when different students are operating at different levels.</p><p></p><p>5. I have not personally experienced mathematics anxiety, but I know many people who have. From my experience, those who had mathematics anxiety typically viewed math class as a chore, and their teacher as somebody who did not really understand them or their difficulties. They felt intimidated by the subject and believed that they were not capable of achieving success. They often preferred to avoid math class or simply go through the motions to avoid the anxiety associated with the subject. Thankfully, most of those I know have been able to overcome the anxiety with the help of supportive peers and teachers.</p><strong>Answer:</strong><p>The teaching cycle is an essential process in ensuring effective learning in any classroom. However, among all the stages in the teaching cycle, I believe that the <strong>planning stage is the most important</strong>. Planning helps teachers establish clear objectives, develop effective teaching strategies, and choose appropriate assessment methods that will ensure students' success. Without proper planning, teachers may lose track of their goals and may fail to meet the specific needs of their students.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to teaching intermediate grades with special needs, <strong>the most effective strategy is differentiated instruction</strong>. Differentiated instruction is a teaching approach that caters to the diverse learning needs of students. This strategy involves tailoring the curriculum to meet individual needs, learning styles, and interests. It also includes using a variety of instructional methods and materials, such as technology, manipulatives, and cooperative learning, to help students succeed.</p><p></p><p>Constructivism is a teaching approach that emphasizes the active involvement of learners in the learning process. <strong>To apply constructivism in teaching mathematics, teachers should encourage students to engage in problem-solving activities</strong> that will allow them to discover concepts and apply them in real-world situations. Teachers should also provide opportunities for group work, peer-to-peer teaching, and reflection to help students construct their knowledge actively.</p><p></p><p>Despite the benefits of constructivism, there are possible challenges that teachers may face when implementing this approach. <strong>One of the significant challenges is the need for careful planning and preparation</strong>. Teachers may need to spend more time designing activities, selecting appropriate materials, and adapting them to meet students' needs. Another challenge is the need for constant assessment and feedback to ensure that students construct accurate knowledge and avoid misconceptions.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mathematics anxiety is a common experience among students</strong>, and it can be challenging to overcome. When I had mathematics anxiety, I viewed math as a difficult and boring subject. I saw math class as a place where I would struggle and fail. My math teacher's teaching style was not engaging, and I found it difficult to connect with the subject matter. To overcome my anxiety, I had to change my mindset and focus on the practical application of math in my daily life. I also sought help from my teacher and peers and engaged in activities that made math fun and enjoyable.</p><p></p><p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, effective teaching requires careful planning, differentiation, and active engagement of learners. Teachers should apply constructivist principles in their teaching, but they should also be aware of the possible challenges that come with this approach. Finally, addressing mathematics anxiety requires a shift in mindset and a focus on practical application and enjoyable activities.</p><br />
