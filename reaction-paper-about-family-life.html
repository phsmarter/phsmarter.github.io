Michael Faraday was born near London, one of the ten children in a poor working-class family. There was a little chance of anything but the most basic schooling before he was an apprenticed at the age of 14 to firm of bookseller. When he was about 19 years old, he was given a ticket to attend a series of lectures given by Sir Humphrey Davy at the Royal Institution in London. This paved the way to his many discoveries and contributions to ciemisuy, magncüsm, cicuicity and ligini. he was convince üai magnetism could be made to generate electricity just as electricity could create magnetism. Faraday was also a fine lecturer and had an extraordinary gift for explaining the results of scientific research to non- scientist and young people. Eventually he succeeded Davy as superintendent of the Royal Institution. He described his education as follows; "My education was of the most ordinary description consisting of little more than the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic at the common day school. My hours out of school were passed at home and in the streets." Do you possess these characteristics? If you do, then you can be a physicist too.​</a>

                        1. The following parts of myself:a) Your Facial Structure<p>Because I have <strong>self-acceptance</strong>, which is a virtue, I am happy and satisfied with the way my face looks and how it is built. Self-acceptance has helped me like myself, and all of the features on my face fit me well and make me look good. Self-acceptance being a virtue has made me realize that my face is fine as it is, and I don't need to add or take away anything to make it look better or worse. I'm happy with what I see in the mirror. The shape of my face that I see in the mirror is how I see myself, and I'm happy with it because I'm self-accepting, which is a good trait that helps me like my face the way it is.</p><p></p>b) The group of people you know<p>I'm glad to have friends like them and thankful for them. I can count on them when I need <strong>help</strong>, and they can give me the motivation and ideas I need to move forward. Even though they are not my blood, I consider them my family.
