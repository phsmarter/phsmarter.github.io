Directions: Identify Pautasso's suggested ten rules in writing a literature review: Write the answer on the space provided before the number. a 1. The topic must be a well-defined topic that is interesting to you and your readers. 2. Reading other literature reviews from other papers may give you other literature to read and gain information from. 3. It is recommended that you read articles first before starting your literature review so that you could make sense of what the literature says of your chosen topic. This helps you organize the ideas you have read and helps you avoid irrelevant and confusing statements. 4. This has been covered in the previous modules. Choosing the kind of literature review you wish to write will help you structure your sentences and ideas into one coherent form. -5. While you are making the literature review to find answers to your chosen topic or research problem, you can also discuss similar or related issues through it. 6. It is not enough that you summarize the literature you read, try to understand how it differs from the setting and background of the study you are pursuing. Take note of what it lacked or the aspects which can be improved through your own study. 7. In order for a literature review to make sense, it must follow not only a chronological progression of ideas but also of a logical progression. Discuss the problem from its probable causes, continuing on to the current understanding and present solutions for it. After that, you can present your view or proposed solution. _8. Try having a fellow student read your literature review and see if it makes sense to him or her. The reader can point out places where the review has become confusing and thus needs improvement. 9. If you have made research at the same field before, you can cite your own work. However, be careful not to place too much emphasis on your previous research make it seem as it is more important than other sources that you collected. 10. Older studies give a perspective on the problem during a different tim setting. Studying them together with modern studies about the topic help us see how the understanding on tl hangod over time​pa help nmn po | pa sagot ng ayos thank u</a>

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

Lived Experiences of On-Campus Working Students (Frigillano et al., 2015)Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus.This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gatheringinformation about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage,mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financialproblem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. Theyexperienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite workpressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, withhigh self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants'dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthesestudents, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.2.

I needed something I could control and grades provided that for me. The research perspective I learned in classes also made me feel more in control at doctor and therapy appointments. Around Finn's third birthday, he reached age level on all developmental and physical tasks. I transitioned from being a caregiver to "just" a parent. The shift was profound. It had a significant impact on my lived experience as a parent, my lived experience as a student, and my lived experience of health. The worry that consumed me, and the exhaustion I felt as a caregiver dissipated when my role was reduced to parent. I was able to focus on my studies in a more balanced way and I had the energy to build relationships with fellow students in my program. I have the benefit of understanding the experience of being a student as both a caregiver and as a non-cargegiver.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />
