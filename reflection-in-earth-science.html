On your Science notebook, draw a smiley face () if you already know the fact, and a wow face () if this is new to you. Place your answers in your science notebook. The sun may be the closest star to the Earth, but it is certainly not our closest neighbor in space. Here are some facts about the moon: 1. It is the natural satellite of the Earth. A satellite is an object in space that revolves around another object. 2. Our closest neighbor in space is the moon, a rocky ball about one-fourth size of the Earth. 3. It is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system. 4. The moon is one of the heavenly bodies reached by man. The first person to step on the Moon on July 21, 1969, was Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut. 5. Like Earth, the moon does not have the light of its own. The moon can be seen in the sky because it reflects lights from the sun. 6. 7. The moon is the second brightest object in the sky next to the sun. Its name is Luna. It is about 406,676 kilometers away from the Earth with a diameter of 3,476 kilometers, approximately 4 of the Earth's diameter, it is almost as large as Mercury. It has no air and water. 9. It revolves around the Earth. 10. It makes one complete revolution every 27 days and 7 hours, and 43 minutes. 8.​</a>

Place the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 next to the mixed up steps in the greenhouse effect to put them in their proper order starting from the sun.
____ When solar energy waves hit the earth's surface, they slow down, and form longer heat (thermal) energy waves.
____ Some solar energy waves reflect off clouds and greenhouse gasses and return to space.
____ These longer heat energy waves have trouble getting back out into space through the greenhouse gasses.
____ Heat trapped in the atmosphere warms the planet.
____ Other solar energy waves make it to the earth's surface.
____ Short wave solar (radiant) energy waves enter the atmosphere from the sun​</a>

The Earth and Its Atmosphere The Earth is protected by a blanket of air called atmosphere which is composed of five distinct layers. The layer closest to the Earth is the (1) where weather patterns occur and contain the air we breathe. As it extends 50 km above the ground, another layer is called (2) where ozone layer exists and where weather balloons are found. Moving higher until 85 km, the (3)_ is found where burning of meteors happen. Air in this layer is very thin and cold. The layer above the mesosphere is called the (4)_ It is often considered the "hot layer" because it contains the warmest temperatures in the atmosphere. The actual "final frontier" of Earth's gaseous envelope is the last layer called (5) The Sun's rays enter the Earth's atmosphere as (6). This radiation in a form of heat is reflected back to space or absorbed by the (7)__and is trapped in the atmosphere. Some of it reaches the (8), where it is absorbed by the ocean and land. The Earth also releases heat back toward the space called (9)__. Some of this heat successfully escapes back into space and a portion of it is retained by greenhouse gases. The heat goes back down to warm the surface, This process is called (10)__.​</a>

The Earth and its AtmosphereThe Earth is protected by a blanket of air called atmosphere which iscomposed of five distinct layers. The layer closest to the Earth is the (1) whereweather patterns occur and contain the air we breathe. As it extends 50 km abovethe ground, another layer is called (2)_where ozone layer exists and whereweather balloons are found. Moving higher until 85 km, the (3) is found whereburning of meteors happen. Air in this layer is very thin and cold. The layer abovethe mesosphere is called the (4)_ It is often considered the "hot layer" becauseit contains the warmest temperatures in the atmosphere. The actual "final frontier"of Earth's gaseous envelope is the last layer called (5)The Sun's rays enter the Earth's atmosphere as (6) This radiation ina form of heat is reflected back to space or absorbed by the (7). and is trappedin the atmosphere.

The sun may be the closest star to the Earth, but it is certainly not our closest neighbor in space. Here are some facts about the moon: 1. It is the natural satellite of the Earth. A satellite is an object in space that revolves around another object. 2. Our closest neighbor in space is the moon, a rocky ball about one-fourth size of the Earth. 3. It is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system. 4. The moon is one of the heavenly bodies reached by man. The first person to step on the Moon on July 21, 1969, was Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut. 5. Like Earth, the moon does not have the light of its own. The moon can be seen in the sky because it reflects lights from the sun. 6. 7. The moon is the second brightest object in the sky next to the sun. Its name is Luna. It is about 406,676 kilometers away from the Earth with a diameter of 3,476 kilometers, approximately 4 of the Earth's diameter, it is almost as large as Mercury. It has no air and water. 9. It revolves around the Earth. 10. It makes one complete revolution every 27 days and 7 hours, and 43 minutes. 8.​</h2><br />

Place the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 next to the mixed up steps in the greenhouse effect to put them in their proper order starting from the sun.
____ When solar energy waves hit the earth's surface, they slow down, and form longer heat (thermal) energy waves.
____ Some solar energy waves reflect off clouds and greenhouse gasses and return to space.
____ These longer heat energy waves have trouble getting back out into space through the greenhouse gasses.
____ Heat trapped in the atmosphere warms the planet.
____ Other solar energy waves make it to the earth's surface.
____ Short wave solar (radiant) energy waves enter the atmosphere from the sun​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>My reflection about the earth as a planet and life science.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Planet <strong>earth </strong>is a home for us humans. Often times, though, we are not interested in studying or just knowing it further, so we take it for granted. There are of course many branches of <strong>science </strong>that deal with the earth and its features, and I think we must study it with all seriousness, since doing so will make us have a compassion towards the earth and lives of <strong>organisms </strong>that depend on it, including humans.</p><p></p><p><strong>Life science</strong>, meanwhile, is a branch in science that studies about living organisms. We study this at school during our early school years. This subject include animals, plants, as well as many others. I think it is an interesting subject because we get to know many variations, lifestyles, as well as features of such beings. </p><p></p><p>Studying<strong> life science</strong> will make us grateful of life that God has given us. However, I also understand that in these two subjects, there are tons of things that we should remember, and sometimes this can be difficult. So, remembering one thing at a time would help a lot in this case.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> the subject of life science</strong> by referring to https://brainly.ph/question/17435132</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Earth is a unique and beautiful planet in the universe, known for its diverse and abundant life forms. It is home to millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms that interact with each other and the environment in intricate and complex ways.</p><p></p><p>The existence of life on Earth is a result of a delicate balance of factors such as the right temperature, atmospheric conditions, and the availability of water and nutrients. The interconnected web of life on Earth is constantly evolving and adapting to changes in the environment, and it is this diversity and resilience that has allowed life to thrive on the planet for billions of years.</p><p></p><p>However, as humans, we have had a significant impact on the natural systems and balance of life on Earth. Our activities, such as deforestation, pollution, and the emission of greenhouse gases, have disrupted the delicate balance and caused harm to many species and the environment. Climate change and the loss of biodiversity are two major concerns that threaten the future of life on Earth.</p><p></p><p>It is important for us to reflect on our actions and the impact they have on the planet. We have a responsibility to protect and preserve the natural systems and life on Earth for future generations. This requires conscious efforts to reduce our impact and promote sustainability, such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and protecting natural habitats.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Earth is a remarkable and precious place, teeming with life and beauty. Our actions have a significant impact on the environment and its inhabitants, and it is our duty to preserve and protect it for the future. Through reflection and action, we can help ensure that life continues to flourish on Earth for generations to come.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I learned that the universe is so wide and mysterious that many theories had been made to explain the whole of it. But the bigbang theory was the theory that the majority of people believed. The Earth is amazing as well as it is the only planet whom humans can survive. The Earth also has many different kinds and types of rock that we can use in daily life. It is because, I believe, our planet consist of three layers of internal structure: crust, mantle and core. One of the reasons why Earth called as the only planet among our solar system that can sustain life as it contains natural cycles like the water cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the carbon cycle. Plants play a key role in maintaining the balance of each of these cycles that is also believed that plants only exists on our planet.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Gomen!

                        While the mechanisms of evolution are still under investigation, scientists universally accept that the cosmos, our planet, and life evolved and continue to evolve. Yet the teaching of evolution to schoolchildren is still contentious.In Science and Creationism, The National Academy of Sciences states unequivocally that creationism has no place in any science curriculum at any level.Briefly and clearly, this booklet explores the nature of science, reviews the evidence for the origin of the universe and earth, and explains the current scientific understanding of biological evolution. This edition includes new insights from astronomy and molecular biology.Attractive in presentation and authoritative in content, Science and Creationism will be useful to anyone concerned about America's scientific literacy: education policymakers, school boards and administrators, curriculum designers, librarians, teachers, parents, and students<br />
