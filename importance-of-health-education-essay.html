Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</a>

Essay 1: Importance of Education smmibe Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training. It can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum. In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training. Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards.​</a>

Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</h2><br />

Essay 1: Importance of Education smmibe Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training. It can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum. In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training. Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards.​</h2><br />
