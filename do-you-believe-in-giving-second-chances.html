                                            Of More Value By Jerry B Jenkins A friend, a father of two daughters, admits he does not mind putting a line fear into the boys trying to have a date with his daughter. His daughters are sometimes embarrassed when their father asks for a few moments alone with their date, and he would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy that he is a mean, protective father to his daughters Besides, he believes that there is no such thing as being overprotective. Another friend says he uses sports analogy to get his point across He would tell the boy, "If I owned the most expensive, exotic sports cars on the road and I let you take it for a spin, you'd be careful with it wouldn't you?" "Oh yes, Sir, you bet. " "You'd treat it better than it was your own wouldn't you?" "Yes, Sir." "I wouldn't want to think you were screeching the tires, would 17 "No. Sir" "Well, let me tell you something, just so we're straight with each other, man to man My daughter is of infinitively more value to me than any car could be. Do you got my drift? She's on loan from me to you for the next few hours and I wouldnt want to discover that she's treated with any less care or respect that I would give here. I'm responsible for her. She's mine. Im entrusting her to you. That trust gives no second chance Understood?" By then, of course, the young man is wondering why he didn't ask someone else out. He's only nodding, unable to speak Most often, he brings the gat home earlier than promised. The daughter might even complain about her father's approach, but deep down, she feels loved and cherished and you can be sure she'll marry a man who treats her that way C. DEVELOPING THE SKILLS Read the questions carefully and write your answers below. 1. How does the first father show he values his daughter? 2. How does the sports analogy of the second father affect the boy asking permission to date his daughter? 3. Which of the two fathers do you think has a better approach to their daughters' suitors?​</a>

You may modify the sample outline format presented before. This I Believe Carlos P. Romulo I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</a>

Then, the second and so on until we successfully finished reciting the entire piece."Good job, children! You can win this, "Miss Villanueva, our English teacher commented.How did Masilanueva motivate the children to give their best?I could still recall one of the most challenging moments in my life three years ago when I got sick of dengue. Nobody could tell that I can surve that time. But because offered everything to God, I have nothing to worry.That moment made me realize that only in His hands can be sure that I can be a star and will continue to shine even in the midst of darkness.SELF ASSESSMENT QUESTIONSWrite your answers at the back of this sheet.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The amount of people that you give a second chance can either help or hurt you. We all learn from our mistakes, but every person is different. Do not stop giving second chances to people just because one person may have screwed you over. Second chances are meant to give people another chance.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hinde poyan sa akin nasagot pero ganyan ren ang sasabihin ko. btw thanks for the points ❤️❤️❤️</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yes</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>because people do deserve second chance but its up to you kung bibigyan mo :)</p><br />

                            5. Of More Value By Jerry B Jenkins A friend, a father of two daughters, admits he does not mind putting a line fear into the boys trying to have a date with his daughter. His daughters are sometimes embarrassed when their father asks for a few moments alone with their date, and he would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy that he is a mean, protective father to his daughters Besides, he believes that there is no such thing as being overprotective. Another friend says he uses sports analogy to get his point across He would tell the boy, "If I owned the most expensive, exotic sports cars on the road and I let you take it for a spin, you'd be careful with it wouldn't you?" "Oh yes, Sir, you bet. " "You'd treat it better than it was your own wouldn't you?" "Yes, Sir." "I wouldn't want to think you were screeching the tires, would 17 "No. Sir" "Well, let me tell you something, just so we're straight with each other, man to man My daughter is of infinitively more value to me than any car could be. Do you got my drift? She's on loan from me to you for the next few hours and I wouldnt want to discover that she's treated with any less care or respect that I would give here. I'm responsible for her. She's mine. Im entrusting her to you. That trust gives no second chance Understood?" By then, of course, the young man is wondering why he didn't ask someone else out. He's only nodding, unable to speak Most often, he brings the gat home earlier than promised. The daughter might even complain about her father's approach, but deep down, she feels loved and cherished and you can be sure she'll marry a man who treats her that way C. DEVELOPING THE SKILLS Read the questions carefully and write your answers below. 1. How does the first father show he values his daughter? 2. How does the sports analogy of the second father affect the boy asking permission to date his daughter? 3. Which of the two fathers do you think has a better approach to their daughters' suitors?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The first father shows that he values his daughter by being protective of her and trying to scare off potential suitors who might not treat her well. He would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy than not being a mean, protective father to his daughters.</p><p>2. The sports analogy of the second father puts pressure on the boy asking permission to date his daughter by suggesting that the father's daughter is of infinite more value than any car, and that the boy must treat her with the same care and respect as he would the father's sports car.</p><p>3. Both fathers have their own approaches, but the second father's approach may be more effective in getting his point across and making sure that the boy understands the responsibility he is taking on when asking to date his daughter.</p><br />

You may modify the sample outline format presented before. This I Believe Carlos P. Romulo I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</h2><br />
