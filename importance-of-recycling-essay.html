                                            pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

                            1. ESSAY: Write a short essay explaining the importance of recycling. Use the template below. Importance of Recycling​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Reducing waste, reusing materials and products, and recycling are some of the most extremely powerful ways individual, households, and business can protect environmental. By simply making smart decisions as to what we buy and how we get the most away from our purchases, we can work together to lower the amount of waste. Reusing discarded products and using recycled materials in order to make new products reduces the usage of virgin materials, which often involves harvesting trees and mining the earth. Even better, “source reducing” waste — or avoiding the generation of discards in the first place — saves the absolute most resources. Manufacturers of natural resources, such as bauxite or aluminum ore, and improving them to make products use energy. Often fossil fuels produce this energy. When people throw away these things, they send them to landfills, where they can last for centuries or more completely to split up. Reducing, reusing, and recycling helps reduce human exposure to the environment, carbon dioxide emissions, and energy use, and limits the number of people in the landfill.</strong></p>But most importantly, it will help us to save our planet. Besides, recycling saves the earth by facilitating the reprocess of paper which will save millions of trees. Also, recycling saves a lot of energy because many things that we recycle can easily be converted into virgin materials. In addition, it saves a lot of resources too. Moreover, recycling reduces the burden on the environment. As we save energy the number of greenhouse gases and oxides are produced in less quantity. Because most of the toxic gases are produced by factories. But, the process of plastic recycling is a little bit complex because they have to sort out the different types of plastics. As there is a diverse variety of plastic with different properties. In addition, sort your waste and dump your recyclable waste in the recycle bin so that the authorities can recycle it.<p>   </p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Paki highlight nalang po yung important stuff</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Recycling is important practice at home because<p></p><p><strong>Reduces energy waste</strong> – it is a known fact that using recycled resources in the process of manufacturing uses considerably less energy than what is normally required to produce new products out of raw materials.</p><p></p><p><strong>Reduces the need for clearance</strong> – nobody likes to see their home in a state of mess, and yet that is what often happens when you accumulate too much junk. When you recycle the products you use, you will ultimately reduce the need to clear out items you have no more need of. That is why recycling in the form of donating or selling so that other people can use some of your belongings are two fine options for you to consider.</p><p></p><p><strong>Important for children</strong> – if you want your children to grow up to be responsible towards nature and the environment, you better teach them how to recycle. It is not difficult at all even for young children to understand that paper, plastic and aluminum cans should be put in different containers and not just thrown out as garbage. Turn it into a game and that way you will have them engaged in a very useful activity, which will only teach a valuable lesson for the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>Recycling is easy </strong>– it is not hard at all to separate the usable materials, such as plastic and paper from your everyday activities and discard them in a cautious manner. You can make two additional containers in your home and toss the said items there, allowing for their recycling later on. This will not only reduce the need for additional waste clearance, but also contribute to a good cause.</p><p></p><p><strong>Help the environment</strong> – the most substantial benefit of recycling is that it reduces the need to create raw materials in the process of extraction, refinement and processing. This in turn leads to a reduction in water and air pollution, which is a recipe for a greener and better tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>With pressing environmental issues such as pollution and global warming on the rise, it's no surprise that people are becoming more interested in green living. People are beginning to recognize the significance of environmentally friendly practices, which is a positive development in the long run.</p><p></p><p>To begin to mitigate the negative impact of human activity on the environment, each individual must make an effort on his or her own. There are numerous ways in which you can contribute to making the world a greener place. Some steps in that direction have a greater impact than others, such as the installation of green energy features and consideration of environmentally friendly house demolition. If you want to avoid wasting 80-120 percent of your mattress's useful life, consider a biodegradable latex mattress.</p><p></p><p>It spent years decomposing in a landfill, just like the majority of mattresses. One thing is certain: everyone should put forth their best effort and make a positive contribution.</p><p></p><p>Recycling at home is an excellent way to reduce your carbon footprint, and you should get started as soon as possible. Repurposing old products that are no longer needed by converting them back into usable materials is made possible by this technology. It is simple to implement and manage, and it is something that everyone who cares about the environment should think about implementing. Think about recycling some of the junk you've accumulated for the junk removal service the next time you take a look at your collection. Here are a few of the undeniable benefits of recycling that you should know about:</p><p>1, Reduces energy waste: It is well known that using recycled resources in the manufacturing process uses significantly less energy than what is normally required to produce new products from raw materials.</p><p>2, Reduces the need for clearance – Nobody wants to see their home in shambles, but that is frequently what happens when you accumulate too much junk.</p><p>3, When you recycle the products you use, you reduce the need to get rid of items you no longer need. That is why recycling in the form of donating or selling your belongings so that others can use them are two excellent options for you to consider.</p><p>4, Important for children: if you want your children to grow up caring about nature and the environment, you should teach them how to recycle. Even young children can understand that paper, plastic, and aluminum cans should be separated and not thrown away in the same container. Make it a game, and you'll have them engaged in a very useful activity that will only teach them a valuable lesson for the future.</p><p>5, Recycling is simple—it is not difficult to separate usable materials, such as plastic and paper, from your daily activities and dispose of them responsibly. You can create two additional containers in your home and place the aforementioned items in them, allowing for their recycling later. This will not only reduce the need for additional waste clearance, but will also help a worthy cause.</p><p>6, Help the environment: The most significant advantage of recycling is that it reduces the need to create raw materials in the extraction, refinement, and processing processes. This, in turn, reduces water and air pollution, paving the way for a greener and better tomorrow.</p><p>Recycling at home is really not that hard as you’d imagine. All it takes is some motivation to get it going and soon enough you will feel good about doing a good deed.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlist salamat &lt;33 </p><br />

                            12. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</h2><br />

Activity 8: Directions: Read the passage below and complete the graphicDeforestation is a serious problem because it destroys forests—and forestsorganizer that follows.and trees are not just pretty to look at they do an important job making the earth'senvironment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve oil, andprovide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, woodproducts, and paperproducts for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rainforestshave been destroyedToday, all around the world, deforestation continues the world's climate maychange, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to theproblem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use less paper, fewer trees willbe cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce yourpaper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, orwrite an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather thanusing a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping listor phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on theback of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead ofthrowing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recyclingcenter. If you follow the three Rs"-reduce, reuse, and recycle-you can help save theworld's forestECUse the figure aboveas your guide​</h2><br />
