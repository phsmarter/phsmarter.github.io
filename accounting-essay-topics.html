Make sure to remind them that they will take on the shoes of the owner/manager in solving the case. 3. Below is the business case. You may look for or make another business case as long as it highlights the same topics. Chloe's Closet Chloe Mendez owns a clothing company, Chloe's Closet. She has a team of tailors who work for 8 hours every day from Monday to Saturday. Demand for her business is strong but there seems to be something preventing her from meeting the demands of her customers. Chloe sells to both big department stores and small boutique stores under the brand Chloe's Closet. Some brands also ask her to manufacture their own designs. Business for Chloe has been good since it started last 2014. In fact, despite the tough competition from cheaper manufacturers abroad, she still manages to grow her customer base. On December 4, 2015 Chloe received a billing statement from a raw material supplier for an amount of PHP400,000 which will be due in 5 days. She is also scheduled to pay her employees' monthly salary of PHP70,000 the following day. Upon checking her bank account, she only has a PHP67,000 balance. She knew she had exceeded her sales target last October and November so she is wondering why she only has this amount of cash in her bank account. Was her money stolen? Being a CPA, she checked the bank statement and her financial records and found no mistakes. Here is the latest financial statement of Chloe's Closet as of November 30, 2015:​</a>

An autobiography uses third person point of view. A biography utilizes the first person point of view.3. Personal and true narratives are based on real life events. Personal narratives focus on a topic through the lens of the personal experiences of the narrator. 4. Reflective essays focus on narrating someone else's life. A travel experience once it is published in a personal website is considered a travel blog. 5. Biographies and autobiographies focus on single events in life. Testimonios contain an account of experiences of a person shared by another person. 6. A reportage presents facts in a literary way. Reflective essays can be crafted based on any moment in one's life that instills lessons. 7.Reflective essays, testimonies, and personal narratives are autobiographical in nature. A true narrative only tells personal experiences8. A written work is called a personal narrative if the author shares his or her experience of an event in his or her life. Someone else's moment in his or her life written by another person is a true narrative.​</a>

She has a team of tailors who work for 8 hours every day from Monday to Saturday. Demand for her business is strong but there seems to be something preventing her from meeting the demands of her customers. Chloe sells to both big department stores and small boutique stores under the brand Chloe's Closet. Some brands also ask her to manufacture their own designs. Business for Chloe has been good since it started last 2014. In fact, despite the tough competition from cheaper manufacturers abroad, she still manages to grow her customer base. On December 4, 2015 Chloe received a billing statement from a raw material supplier for an amount of PHP400,000 which will be due in 5 days. She is also scheduled to pay her employees' monthly salary of PHP70,000 the following day. Upon checking her bank account, she only has a PHP67,000 balance. She knew she had exceeded her sales target last October and November so she is wondering why she only has this amount of cash in her bank account. Was her money stolen? Being a CPA, she checked the bank statement and her financial records and found no mistakes. Here is the latest financial statement of Chloe's Closet as of November 30, 2015:​</h2><br />

Someone else's moment in his or her life written by another person is a true narrative.​</h2><br />

                        I’ll answer the first topic which is “Should school be taught online instead of in a classroom?”<br /><br />To answer that question in my personal opinion, no.<br /><br />You see, there are a lot of benefits regarding studying at school more than online. You see your friends more, and interact socially with people, and you absorb more knowledge that way since a teacher is teaching you. Not self taught or whatever. You can also go to different rooms whenever you have different classes which I think kind of contributes to getting fit. There’s really countless reasons on why Offline Classes &gt; Online Classes<br /><br /><br />This is my personal opinion, hope it helps.
