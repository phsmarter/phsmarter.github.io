                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                                            Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</a>

Educators can also focus more on mastery of learning and adopt grades that demonstrate or indicate mastery of knowledge and skills, or lack thereof.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, pandemic life is the "new normal" and not an excuse to blow off your homework anymore. Here's how you can adapt for a better school experience.  It's difficult to set standards in the midst of a pandemic. Before this all began, we had deadlines, and they were either met or they weren't. When the pandemic began, for some high school teachers and college professors, sticking to deadlines was still a hard and fast rule. But other teachers offered some leniency to students, knowing everyone was having a difficult time. This system worked reasonably well for those students who felt unmotivated due to COVID-19. However, just like everything else, getting back on track will require some tinkering since this has become our new normal. Instead of a small percentage of students with extenuating circumstances seeking leniency, we're all living in one massive extenuating circumstance right now: COVID-19. That was a valid excuse for every student for not completing an assignment or being prepared for a test (and for many students, it was genuine). This global health crisis has led to a myriad of problems, ranging from mental and physical health to bad Wi-Fi connections to having a place to stay. Students stressed in ways they had never imagined, and nothing about our current situation can be considered stable. However, many of us have a tendency to make excuses for ourselves, to others or in our own minds, about our ability to pull ourselves together to learn.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope nakatulong ;)</p><br />

                            4. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                            12. Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</h2><br />
