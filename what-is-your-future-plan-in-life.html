C. Give an insight on the passage. 
 God has entrusted to us His wonderful ecosystems. It our role and duty to maintain and conserve the balance of life. Getting what we need and thinking of the needs of the future generation is a way of maintain the sustainability of Earth.</h2><br />

I will clearly explain that Mangrove trees provide benefits not only for the people but also for marine biodiversity. Ir protects everyone from possible natural disasters such as storm surges, flooding, etc. Aside from these, they also provide shelter for the marine species to balance the ecosystem. Their adaptation to saltwater is incredible. If we are going to convert these areas, we will lose a lot from natural protectors to a huge percentage of marine biodiversity.</p><p></p><p>C. </p><p>I believe that the insight gives us a lesson about our real role here on Earth. It reminds us that we are not the owner of the world and that we are not in the position to alter everything based on how we would want the world to be. It also gives us a hint that we should not change the world in a bad way just for the benefit of humankind. Nature itself is balanced. We, humans, are just the ones destroying the equilibrium and believed that we are the sole owners of the Earth.</p><p></p><p>If you want to read anything about the goals in life, you can head over to this link for more information:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/11196896</p><p></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. For me, I don't think I am ready yet for the adult life since I am still learning and growing as a person. There are personal issues that I haven't worked out yet, but I hope that I will be able to soon. Another example is that I don't think I am mature enough and still need to learn how to overcome struggles in life.</p><p></p><p>2. Some of the ways that I can do to overcome obstacles in my life is by asking for help and accepting that it's ok for me to ask help from others if I am having difficulties. Sometimes, we feel that we are not able to overcome a problem and we feel inferior because of that. That's why I always remind myself that reaching out to other people is ok and that sometimes you just need someone to listen to you. And another thing I do to cope up is to hold myself accountable. This way, I am able to learn from my mistakes and grow from them.</p><p></p><p>3. As a teenager, for me to be able to create responsible future relationships, I should learn to communicate to the other person about problems, boundaries, etc. Just like what they say, "Communication is the key". Being able to discuss anything with the other person will help build trust and understanding in each other. </p><br />
