She understood little of what the Level 4 teachersaid. He spoke too fast for her. She had struggled through a Level 3 class at aMonrovia school.When the teacher asked if there were any questions, she told him thatshe didn't understand most of what he had said. He told her not to worry; shecould take the class again if she failed it the first time. She didn't want to failit the first time, however, or any time.He gave them homework the first day, of course. They were supposedto write a 300-word essay supporting gun control. Of course, Dotty said, shecould write that essay in her native language. But there was no easy way shecould write it in English. She showed Johnny the textbook. The print was sotiny that trying to read just a few pages gave her a headache. On top of thatwas all the new vocabulary on each page. "I'm going to drop the class," shesaid. She wanted to cry. When was she ever going to learn this message?What is the purpose of this conversation?​</a>

                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

                                            write the conjunction found in the essay below.?For years and years, English teachers at elementary and middle schools across the United States would have been astonished by that question. Mrs. Beedle, my fourth grade teacher, would have turned from the blackboard to glare at any student who asked such an absurd thing. (Yeah, blackboards were still being used when I went to school.)“Of course you may not begin a sentence with a conjunction,” she would have snapped. “Why, the very idea!”We believed her. Back then, we trusted Mrs. Beedle. We loved how she could explain the rules of English so there were always definite answers, in crisp black and white, with no ambiguity whatsoever. Grammar was rational, comforting, and precise, while the real world was messy and complicated. And Mrs. Beedle was our guide to that land of certainty.I’m sure some of my classmates went on to become English teachers themselves, and they taught their students the lessons Mrs. Beedle gave us, and their students’ students passed on the same message to later generations. Chief among those lessons was the prohibition against starting a sentence with a conjunction.But Mrs. Beedle was wrong.​</a>

                            15. liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1.

                        What are the roles of us as teachers to lessen the bullying? Not all of the students are in charge of adjusting when it comes to bullying. We, facilitators, also help to lessen the bullying cases as we discipline our pupils or students. Every teachers should be a role model to their students whom they are teaching. We are not just enhancing the comprehension, reading, writing, speaking, grammar, mathematical, or any acdemic- related skills that we should know and learn as we accelerate to upper levels of learning and dreaming, we also enhance and improve our students' values.<br /><br />As a teacher, these are the things we are intended to do. We do facilitate and monitor our classes and the students who belong in our classes we are monitoring. To lessen bullying, we always watch them wherever they go even though we're no there physically, we still manage to monitor by installing cameras around the school and within its premises. We also track the records of those who are bullying and being bullied, however, the numbers of those who are reporting to us that are being bullied are decreasing mainly because of threats by their bullies and ends up being bullied continuously and consequently. However, although not yet implemented or probably implemented by other schools, we can use social media for the bullied ones to share experience and gain justice and alleviate the bullies in their lives. They will be anonymously known so that no one will know their identity.<br /><br />Those are just some of the ways that are possible to achieve so that we can lessen and alleviate the percentage of bullying cases in our country. I do believe that the government will help us solve this problem. As a conclusion, we should help each other because if only one will work then the problem will not be solved the way it should be. We should practice and impose unity between the students and us, teachers, for us to be able to surpass this kind of grave situation.<br />

You might revisit this section over the course of a school year as you refine your goals.</p><p></p><p>Summaries: Add summaries of your accomplishments or growth in a consistent format. These might be weekly or monthly reflections where you discuss a lesson, interaction, or activity that was particularly memorable to you. Consistency is more important than length, so having more, shorter updates that show growth or development over time should be a priority.</p><p></p><p>Artifacts: A summary provides a quick description, but artifacts provide the evidence that illustrates what you’ve accomplished. They may include links to interactive presentations you tried with Nearpod or a collection of Flipgrid videos with student responses. You might have images to add, like photographs or screenshots. Or there may be links to something you or your students created that you’d like to include as examples of what you accomplished this year.

                            22. i had an english exam last week. there was one essay related to cleaning. i wrote "cleaning supplies" in a sentence but my teacher marked -1 for that word. i asked her why and she said it was because "cleaning supplies" and "cleaning tools" or "cleaning eqiuipment" arent the same. is it because the word "cleaning supplies" is american english and not brittish english? ( im malaysian and i have to use brittish english in tests ) or did she marked it wrong? or was it because "cleaning supplies had another definition? can someone please explain why? my teacher wont explain it to me. thanks. </h2><br />
                        <p>Tool and equipment are the terms that can be used as synonyms of each other. While there are a lot of differences between these two terms.

                            23. write the conjunction found in the essay below.?For years and years, English teachers at elementary and middle schools across the United States would have been astonished by that question. Mrs. Beedle, my fourth grade teacher, would have turned from the blackboard to glare at any student who asked such an absurd thing. (Yeah, blackboards were still being used when I went to school.)“Of course you may not begin a sentence with a conjunction,” she would have snapped. “Why, the very idea!”We believed her. Back then, we trusted Mrs. Beedle. We loved how she could explain the rules of English so there were always definite answers, in crisp black and white, with no ambiguity whatsoever. Grammar was rational, comforting, and precise, while the real world was messy and complicated. And Mrs. Beedle was our guide to that land of certainty.I’m sure some of my classmates went on to become English teachers themselves, and they taught their students the lessons Mrs. Beedle gave us, and their students’ students passed on the same message to later generations. Chief among those lessons was the prohibition against starting a sentence with a conjunction.But Mrs. Beedle was wrong.​</h2><br />
