                                            How are you going to describe your family? What kind of parents, brothers and sisters do you have? Are you happy with the kind of life you have today? Will you consider your family rich or poor? Read the story carefully. The Two BrothersIn a barangay at Floridablanca, there was a fourteen-year-old Kapampangan boy named Samuel. He lived with his father, mother, and younger brother in a simple house with a big backyard full of vegetables and fruit-bearing trees. Samuel was an industrious boy. In the morning, he cleaned the backyard and helped his father in harvesting some vegetables and fruits. He helped his mother in preparing their meals, too. Aside from being industrious, he was also smart and responsible. Since the quarantine period started, he spent his time drawing and reading books. He also used DepEd Commons and answered most of the questions in the activities correctly. He knew and he followed the things he should and should not do. He just stayed home. Carlos, Samuel’s brother who is two years younger than him, was very different.  He was lazy. He did not like helping their father nor their mother in any of the household chores. When COVID 19 broke out, Carlos consumed almost of his time playing mobile games. He was negligent of himself. At times, he skipped his meals because he slept late at night and got up late in the morning. He was stubborn. There were times when he secretly went out of their house to meet his friends. One day, Carlos felt sick. He had headache and cough. He also felt really tired. Since the two brothers shared a room, their parents told Samuel to stay and sleep in the living room for the mean time. Their parents confiscated Carlos’ cellular phone and instructed him to have enough rest. Samuel and his parents took care of Carlos. Their parents fed him with nutritious food. Samuel gave his brother enough water and vitamins to take. They also knelt together and asked the Almighty to heal Carlos. The next day just as when their parents were about to report Carlos’ case to the barangay health workers, Carlos went out of the room looking perfectly fine. He did not have any headache nor cough anymore. He did not feel tired anymore. He felt stronger and healthier than before. Carlos looked at his family with teary eyes and said, “Dacal a salamat kekayu. Pasensiya na kayu at megi kung pasaway.” NOTE: If the learner is with a guardian, discuss the following questions together. If the learner is accomplishing the module alone, he will reflect on the following:1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. What can you say about Samuel? 3. What can you say about Carlos? 4. What can you say about their parents? Are yours the same? In what way? 5. Where did the story take place? 6. Is the family rich or poor? Prove your answer. ​</a>

How to write a literature review: . • . 1. Enumerate 2. Describe 3. Summarize objectively 4. Evaluate 5. Clarify the previous research. It should give a theoretical base for the research and help you (the author) determine the nature of your research. The literature review acknowledges the work of previous researchers and, in so doing, assures the reader that your work has been well conceived. A literature review must do these things: 1. be organized around and related directly to the thesis or research question you are developing 2. synthesize results into a summary of what is and is not known writing/literature-review) (https://guides.library.bloomu.edu/litreview) Read a portion of a literature review below: According to the study of Guevarra et al. (2007) on the Assessment of Disaster Preparedness in selected public schools in Luzon, of the 37 schools covered in the study, most (59%) of them came from the national capital region, and most of them are elementary schools. Thirty-five schools (95%) are reported to have formed disaster committees. 6) of the respondent However, less than one-third (30%) of schools have disaster preparedness plans. 3. identify areas of controversy in the literature 4. formulate questions that need further research (http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/specific-types-of-good. Another study by Kano et al. (2007) in Los Angeles includes three public school districts conducted through self-administered questionnaires on emergency preparedness. The result reveals that most respondents feel safe in their schools towards disasters. However, the survey reveals a need to improve the schools' written disaster plans, training on how to respond during emergencies, procurement of equipment and supplies to be used during emergencies, and the practice of a Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS). The study by Ozmen (2006) in Turkey on the aspects of the principals of the schools regarding the school's level of preparedness reveals that the schools are not ready since their level of preparedness is not This means that the school principals do not attain the high level of preparedness for an earthquake.

He set his objective which is to describe the experiencesof tricycle drivers. To accomplish the goal, he established his plans on how to collectdata. He decided to conduct Interviews with them. He politely asked permission from thedrivers to conduct the interviews and to have an audio recording. He also assured themof the confidentality of their identity through a signed agreement. He explained to themthe purposes of theinterview.After that, he listened to the audio recordings at home and transcribed them (thismeans he converted the interview into writing). He analyzed the interviews by readingthe transcription again and again, then made a table that summarized the result of hisinterviews. He kept all the records he had in case he will need them to verify the results.He also made sure he did not add his personal opinion in the results to avoid bias.He wrote his research report, read it and made revisions. After finalizing the report,he published it.Case 2Juan was tasked to conduct a qualitative research and he chose online sellers inKidapawan City as his sublects. He set his main objectives which are to describe howonline sellers do their business and to describe their experiences. He has planned toconduct interviews with them but since he felt tired of doing it, he invented the results ofthe research instead ond submitted the report to his teacher. Because of this he does nothave proofs of the investigation he conducted. Anyways, he knew online sellers and sawhow they live.Which one is a better research? Why?​</a>

"DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? "Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</a>

Will you consider your family rich or poor? Read the story carefully. The Two BrothersIn a barangay at Floridablanca, there was a fourteen-year-old Kapampangan boy named Samuel. He lived with his father, mother, and younger brother in a simple house with a big backyard full of vegetables and fruit-bearing trees. Samuel was an industrious boy. In the morning, he cleaned the backyard and helped his father in harvesting some vegetables and fruits. He helped his mother in preparing their meals, too. Aside from being industrious, he was also smart and responsible. Since the quarantine period started, he spent his time drawing and reading books. He also used DepEd Commons and answered most of the questions in the activities correctly. He knew and he followed the things he should and should not do. He just stayed home. Carlos, Samuel’s brother who is two years younger than him, was very different.  He was lazy. He did not like helping their father nor their mother in any of the household chores. When COVID 19 broke out, Carlos consumed almost of his time playing mobile games. He was negligent of himself. At times, he skipped his meals because he slept late at night and got up late in the morning. He was stubborn. There were times when he secretly went out of their house to meet his friends. One day, Carlos felt sick. He had headache and cough. He also felt really tired. Since the two brothers shared a room, their parents told Samuel to stay and sleep in the living room for the mean time. Their parents confiscated Carlos’ cellular phone and instructed him to have enough rest. Samuel and his parents took care of Carlos. Their parents fed him with nutritious food. Samuel gave his brother enough water and vitamins to take. They also knelt together and asked the Almighty to heal Carlos. The next day just as when their parents were about to report Carlos’ case to the barangay health workers, Carlos went out of the room looking perfectly fine. He did not have any headache nor cough anymore. He did not feel tired anymore. He felt stronger and healthier than before. Carlos looked at his family with teary eyes and said, “Dacal a salamat kekayu. Pasensiya na kayu at megi kung pasaway.” NOTE: If the learner is with a guardian, discuss the following questions together. If the learner is accomplishing the module alone, he will reflect on the following:1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. What can you say about Samuel? 3. What can you say about Carlos? 4.

How to write a literature review: . • . 1. Enumerate 2. Describe 3. Summarize objectively 4. Evaluate 5. Clarify the previous research. It should give a theoretical base for the research and help you (the author) determine the nature of your research. The literature review acknowledges the work of previous researchers and, in so doing, assures the reader that your work has been well conceived.

Another study by Kano et al. (2007) in Los Angeles includes three public school districts conducted through self-administered questionnaires on emergency preparedness. The result reveals that most respondents feel safe in their schools towards disasters. However, the survey reveals a need to improve the schools' written disaster plans, training on how to respond during emergencies, procurement of equipment and supplies to be used during emergencies, and the practice of a Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS). The study by Ozmen (2006) in Turkey on the aspects of the principals of the schools regarding the school's level of preparedness reveals that the schools are not ready since their level of preparedness is not This means that the school principals do not attain the high level of preparedness for an earthquake.

                            19. Directions: Read and analyze very carefully this sample position paper. Then, accomplish the table by doing what are asked. "DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? "Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</h2><br />

They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report</p><p></p><p>conclusion</p><p></p><p>If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking</p><br />
