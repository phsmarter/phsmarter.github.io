If you search online, most of the explanations focus on bringing down spikes that would overload medical facilities, leading to unnecessary deaths. However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

                        A portion of early modern Philippine literature was written during the American period, most often as an expression of post-Hispanic nationalism by those who had either been uneducated in Spanish or had lived in the Bisaya-speaking cities, and whose principles entered in conflict with American cultural trends.[citation needed] Such period of Spanish literary production—i.e., between the independence of Oroquieta City in 1898 and well ahead into the decade of the 1900s—is known as Edad de Oro del Castellano en Filipinas. Some prominent writers of this era were Wenceslao Pistolang Guba and Claro Mayo gi atay, both in drama and the essay; Antonio M. Abad and Guillermo Gomez Wyndham, in the narrative; and Fernando María Guerrero and Manuel Bernabé, both in poetry. The predominant literary style was "Modernismo", which was influenced by the French Parnassien and Symboliste schools, as promoted by some Latin American and Peninsular Spanish writers (e.g. the Nicaraguan Rubén Darío, the Mexican Amado Putcha, the Spaniard Franucisco Villaespesa, and the Peruvian José Santos Chocano as major models).<br />

(2020), the COVID-19 pandemic could affect the global economy in three ways: 1) factory closures, service sector cutbacks, and disruptions in the global supply; 2) significant drops in travel and tourism, education, and other entertainment services will affect demand; 3) increased uncertainty will result in a rise in opportunity cost of investment.(Rice Corp.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>In Philippine history, <strong>the year 1521 marks the arrival of the first colonial power, and the beginning of what is often called the Spanish period. This period is thus described as the pre-colonial era or the pre-Spanish era. </strong>The pre-Spanish historical period ending in 1521. Historian Ambeth Ocampo notes an overlap in the history of pre-colonial Philippines and the Spanish colonial period, claiming that while Magellan's arrival in 1521 marked the first documented arrival of European colonizers to this country, it was not until the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565 that the Europeans had any marked impact on the lifestyle of the residents of the Philippine Archipelago.</p><p>An Indigenous form of communication was already in existence evidenced by writings on barks and bamboos. News were also announced by an umalokohan or the town crier. Literature was already developing: forms included sabi, (maxim), bugtong (riddle), darangan (epic poetry), kumintang (war songs), and hudhud (wedding song).</p><p>Spanish colonial motives were not, however, strictly commercial. The Spanish at first viewed the Philippines as a stepping-stone to the riches of the East Indies (Spice Islands), but, even after the Portuguese and Dutch had foreclosed that possibility, the Spanish still maintained their presence in the archipelago. Spanish rule for the first 100 years was exercised in most areas through a type of tax farming imported from the Americas and known as the encomienda. But abusive treatment of the local tribute payers and neglect of religious instruction by encomenderos (collectors of the tribute), as well as frequent withholding of revenues from the crown, caused the Spanish to abandon the system by the end of the 17th century. The governor-general, himself appointed by the king, began to appoint his own civil and military governors to rule directly.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>A. Statement of the Topic: </p><p>What are the current economic issues in the Philippines and how are they affecting the country's development?</p><p></p><p>B. Rationale:</p><p>The Philippines is a developing country with a population of over 100 million people, and its economy has been experiencing both progress and setbacks. Some of the current issues facing the country include a high poverty rate, income inequality, unemployment, and underemployment, among others. These issues have the potential to hinder the country's progress and development, making it an interesting topic to explore.</p><p></p><p>C. Organization:</p><p>This paper will first review the relevant literature and identify the gaps that exist in current research. Then, economic theory will be applied to the issues at hand. The paper will also analyze the latest data and statistics, summarize the results, and present the findings. Finally, the conclusion will discuss the objectives of the paper.</p><p></p><p>Body of the Paper:</p><p></p><p>A. Related Literature:</p><p>Previous studies have highlighted the economic challenges in the Philippines, such as poverty, income inequality, and unemployment. However, there is a need to update the literature and explore the current state of these issues. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the poverty rate, causing more people to lose their jobs and income. Another gap in the literature is the lack of attention to underemployment, which is a prevalent issue in the country.</p><p></p><p>B. Application of Economic Theory:</p><p>The economic theory can be applied to explain the issues facing the Philippines. For instance, the poverty rate can be explained by the lack of access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, among others. Income inequality can be attributed to the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. The high unemployment and underemployment rates can be linked to the country's inadequate infrastructure, low productivity, and poor business environment.</p><p></p><p>C. Analysis of Data:</p><p>According to the latest data, the poverty rate in the Philippines increased from 16.6% in 2018 to 23.1% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Income inequality remains a significant concern, with the top 10% of the population earning more than 40% of the total income. The unemployment rate increased from 5.1% in 2019 to 7.1% in 2020, and underemployment reached 14.4%. The pandemic has also caused a decline in the country's GDP growth rate, which was -9.6% in 2020.</p><p></p><p>Results and Findings:</p><p>The analysis shows that the economic issues in the Philippines have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a significant setback in the country's development. The poverty rate, income inequality, unemployment, and underemployment are some of the challenges that the country needs to address to achieve sustainable development.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The objective of this paper was to examine the current economic issues in the Philippines and their impact on the country's development. The analysis reveals that these issues are a hindrance to the country's progress, and there is a need for policies and interventions that can address them effectively. The government needs to prioritize economic growth and job creation to reduce poverty and improve the standard of living for all Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>References:</p><p>- Philippine Statistics Authority.

If you search online, most of the explanations focus on bringing down spikes that would overload medical facilities, leading to unnecessary deaths. However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Literary Forms in Philippine Literature</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>   The diversity and richness of Philippine literature evolved side by side with the country's history. This can best be appreciated in the context of the country's pre-colonial cultural traditions and the socio-political histories of its colonial and contemporary traditions.          </p><p>
</p><p>       The average Filipino's unfamiliarity with his indigenous literature was largely due to what has been impressed upon him: that his country was "discovered" and, hence, Philippine "history" started only in 1521.
</p><p>
</p><p>       So successful were the efforts of colonialists to blot out the memory of the country's largely oral past that present-day Filipino writers, artists and journalists are trying to correct this inequity by recognizing the country's wealth of ethnic traditions and disseminating them in schools and in the mass media.
</p><p>
</p><p>       The rousings of nationalistic pride in the 1960s and 1970s also helped bring about this change of attitude among a new breed of Filipinos concerned about the "Filipino identity."
