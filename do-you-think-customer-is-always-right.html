                                            Try these following jokes. Note and explain the fallacies being incurred
1. Always Cautious 
A car hits an old lady while she is crossing the street. She experiences only minor injuries. The driver protests, “It is not my fault. I’m a very cautious driver. I have been driving for six years.” “It’s not my fault either. I’m also a cautious person. And I have been walking for 60 years.”
2. Medical Skill 
Three surgeons are trying to impress each other with their achievements. First surgeon: “I operated on the arm of this guy and he has become a famous basketball player.” Second surgeon: “I operated on the leg of this guy and now he’s a world-famous marathon runner!” Third Surgeon: “That’s nothing. I fixed the smile on the face this idiot and now he’s a congressman!”
3. Strict Distinction 
A doctor asks his patient: “How many hours do you sleep every day?” “At most five hours.” “That is too few.” “It is enough. I sleep another 8 hours in the evening.
Duty-bound
Boss: “This is an extremely important position. We need a very responsible person.” Applicant: “Then I am the person you are looking for. In all the companies I worked for in the past, as soon as there is a problem, I was always responsible for it.”
4. So Strong 
Jack thinks that he is the strongest military man in the camp. Once he drank up to five bottles of whisky and started to bother the other customers. He orders another bottle of whiskey but the waiter hesitates to give it to him. “Listen. Give me one more bottle. Otherwise I will be angry. I may destroy this bar.” With that, he bangs his fist on the counter. Quickly right after he does this, a strong earthquake hits. When Jack wakes up on top of a heap of rubble he thinks it over and talks to himself with a smile: “By golly. I never knew I was so strong.”</a>

                                             There was a viral video circulating on social media concerning irate Ilonggo passengers in Puerto Princesa Airport. The story behind the video was that these passengers came from Clark Airport going to Iloilo but their flight was diverted to Puerto Princesa due to local restrictions in with regards to COVID-19, thus, their airplane could not land in Iloilo City. Passengers were frustrated because of too much “waiting time” at the airport and managers/supervisors were not available during that time due to emergency meetings. Who do you think had lapses in this situation, explain? Is the customer always right all the time?</a>

                            6. Try these following jokes. Note and explain the fallacies being incurred
1. Always Cautious 
A car hits an old lady while she is crossing the street. She experiences only minor injuries. The driver protests, “It is not my fault. I’m a very cautious driver. I have been driving for six years.” “It’s not my fault either. I’m also a cautious person. And I have been walking for 60 years.”
2. Medical Skill 
Three surgeons are trying to impress each other with their achievements. First surgeon: “I operated on the arm of this guy and he has become a famous basketball player.” Second surgeon: “I operated on the leg of this guy and now he’s a world-famous marathon runner!” Third Surgeon: “That’s nothing. I fixed the smile on the face this idiot and now he’s a congressman!”
3. Strict Distinction 
A doctor asks his patient: “How many hours do you sleep every day?” “At most five hours.” “That is too few.” “It is enough. I sleep another 8 hours in the evening.
Duty-bound
Boss: “This is an extremely important position. We need a very responsible person.” Applicant: “Then I am the person you are looking for. In all the companies I worked for in the past, as soon as there is a problem, I was always responsible for it.”
4. So Strong 
Jack thinks that he is the strongest military man in the camp. Once he drank up to five bottles of whisky and started to bother the other customers. He orders another bottle of whiskey but the waiter hesitates to give it to him. “Listen. Give me one more bottle. Otherwise I will be angry. I may destroy this bar.” With that, he bangs his fist on the counter. Quickly right after he does this, a strong earthquake hits. When Jack wakes up on top of a heap of rubble he thinks it over and talks to himself with a smile: “By golly. I never knew I was so strong.”</h2><br />

</p>The lapses in this situation are both with the airline and the government. But in this case, the customer is NOT always right all the time.  <p>
</p>The customer is NOT always right all the time. We were all caught off-guard when the number of COVID-19 patients begins to increase. The government needs to implement desperate action in a desperate situation like that. No one expected that. So the lapses are both with the government and the airline for the lack of coordination. But in this scenario in the Puerto Prinsesa airport, the people should've also understood that no one wanted that situation. It was the sudden lockdown that made this situation worse in itself. In a very desperate situation like this, our patience is being tested. We also understand where the passengers are coming from, their anger is understandable but we need compassion. The travel ban was implemented to avoid the risk of their health. The airline also failed to pacify the situation because there was no coordination between their staff and the higher management.
