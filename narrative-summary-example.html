                                            Read the paragraph. Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways. One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016). Joy In Learning English 5. Vibal Group, Inc for the Department of Education) Which sentence states the generalization? How did you know? What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot. Theme refers to the author's message about life or human nature he or she tries to convey in the story. The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</a>

                            4. Read the paragraph. Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways. One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016). Joy In Learning English 5. Vibal Group, Inc for the Department of Education) Which sentence states the generalization? How did you know? What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The generalization in the paragraph is that Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways, but it holds the greatest message of all time - the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. This is stated in the last sentence of the paragraph. The examples presented to validate this generalization are the three ways in which Asma's letter is different from a typical Christmas greeting card, and the message of love and justice that the letter contains. The words and phrases that introduce these examples are "One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ...And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus."</p><p></p><p>CARRY ON LEARNER'S</p><br />
