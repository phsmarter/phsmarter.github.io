                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>However, it is essential to note that academic writing and literary writing are two distinct types of writing.</p><p></p><p>Academic writing is a type of writing that is formal and organized, commonly used in universities, colleges, and scholarly publications. Academic writing focuses on presenting ideas and research in a clear, concise, and logical way, while providing credible sources to support arguments. This type of writing is usually objective, and facts are presented in a way that is free from personal opinions or biases. Examples of academic writing include research papers, theses, dissertations, and academic articles.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, literary writing is a type of writing that is artistic and creative in nature and often explores topics such as human experiences, emotions, and relationships. Literary writing aims to engage readers emotionally and intellectually, using figurative language, imagery, and symbolism to convey meaning. Examples of literary writing include novels, poetry, plays, and essays.</p><p></p><p>Through examining various examples of text types, you will be able to classify them based on their characteristics and understand the difference between academic and literary writing. This will help you recognize the specific purpose and intended audience of different writing styles, therefore improving your overall understanding of various types of writing.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the distinction between academic and literary writing is crucial in developing your writing skills. By being able to differentiate between the two, you can determine the appropriate writing style to use for specific tasks, which can help you meet the expectations of your audiences effectively.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here are five main types of journalistic writing:</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Investigative journalism aims to discover the truth about a topic, person, group, or event. It may require detailed and in-depth exploration through interviews, research, and analysis. The purpose of investigative journalism is to answer questions.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>News journalism reports facts, as they emerge. It aims to provide people with objective information about current events, in straightforward terms.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Feature writing provides a deeper look at events, people, or topics, and offers a new perspective. Like investigative journalism, it may seek to uncover new information, but is less about answering questions, and more about simply providing more information.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Columns are the personal opinions of the writer. They are designed to entertain and persuade readers, and sometimes to be controversial and generate discussion.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Reviews describe a subject in a factual way and then provide a personal opinion on it. They are often about books or television programs when published in news media.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hopes it helps </p><br />
