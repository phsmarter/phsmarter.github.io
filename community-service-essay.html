                            1. argumentative essaystudents should do community service if they come to school late habitually ​</h2><br />
                        <p> Community service is a valuable opportunity for students to give back to their communities while also learning important life skills and values. One group of students who could benefit greatly from participating in community service are those who habitually come to school late.</p><p></p><p>First, community service can serve as a form of punishment for students who are habitually late to school. Instead of solely receiving disciplinary action, such as detention or suspension, students could be required to complete a certain number of community service hours as a way to make amends for their actions. This approach would not only hold the student accountable for their behavior, but it would also give them the opportunity to give back to their community in a positive way.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, community service can help to instill a sense of responsibility and accountability in students who habitually come to school late. By participating in community service, these students will learn the importance of being reliable and punctual, as well as the value of giving back to their community. Through their experiences, they will understand that their actions have consequences and that they have a responsibility to make things right.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, community service can be an excellent way for students to develop important life skills. For example, students who participate in community service can learn teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills. These skills will not only help them in their academic and personal lives but also in their future careers.</p><p></p><p>Finally, community service can be an excellent way for students to learn empathy and compassion. By volunteering their time and energy to help others, students will learn the importance of serving and supporting others. They will learn the importance of taking care of their communities, and they will develop a sense of civic responsibility.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, community service is a valuable opportunity for students who habitually come to school late to give back to their communities, develop important life skills and learn the importance of responsibility and civic duty. It is a more productive and beneficial way to handle the situation than solely punishing the student.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>       Effectiveness, financial security, equity, and responsiveness are all important goals of health systems and, by extension, health services. Evidence from high-income countries suggests that school health services have the potential to perform well across a range of health-system objectives.</p><p> </p><p>        School health services are available to families and are available where the majority of adolescents are. They overcome obstacles such as transportation, inconvenient locations, and appointment systems. They have the ability to influence multiple health determinants, such as public health interventions and environmental change strategies.</p><p>        There is some evidence, mostly from high-income countries, that school health services are effective, particularly for sexual and reproductive health, obesity and physical activity improvements, self-care among youth with chronic health conditions such as asthma or diabetes, smoking cessation, and the prevention and management of infectious disease among adolescents through immunizations.</p><p></p><p>       They are completely free at the point of use. Services appear to have cost benefits in terms of adolescent health and society as a whole by reducing health disparities and secondary care facility attendance.   They are highly valued by students, parents, and communities, and they can serve as conduits between schools and communities</p><p>    </p><p>       School health services manage CHCs in a safe and effective manner, often for students who have limited access to health care. Students with CHCs who have direct access to school nursing and other health services, as well as disease-specific education, have better health and academic outcomes. Students perform better in school when they are emotionally and physically healthy, according to research. They miss fewer classes, are less likely to engage in risky or antisocial behavior, concentrate better, and perform better on tests.</p><p>        </p><p>( pa brainliest po )</p><br />

Called to Service and Evangelization
Laity are called to fulfill the mission of communicating Christ in whatever field of work they find themselves in, such as education, politics, media, health, and government.
Explain the given role and make a essay about it.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The role of lay people in the Church is an important and crucial one, and one of the most important roles that they are called to exercise is "Called to Service and Evangelization." This role emphasizes the importance of the laity in spreading the message of Christ to others and helping to fulfill the mission of the Church.</p><p></p><p>As lay people, we are called to communicate the message of Christ in our everyday lives, in whatever field we find ourselves in. Whether it's through our work in education, politics, media, health, or government, we have the opportunity to be a witness to the love and grace of God in our lives. This is a critical role that we must take seriously, as it is through our actions and our words that others will come to know and understand the truth of the Gospel.</p><p></p><p>In order to fulfill this role, we must first be rooted in our own faith and have a deep understanding of the teachings of the Church. This requires a commitment to ongoing spiritual formation, including prayer, reading the Bible, and participating in Mass. It also involves a willingness to engage with the world around us, to seek out opportunities to serve others and to share the love of God with those who are in need.</p><p></p><p>In addition to serving as witnesses to the Gospel, we are also called to actively evangelize, to share the Good News with those who are searching for meaning and purpose in their lives. This means going out into the world, reaching out to those who are far from the Church, and sharing the message of salvation and hope. Whether this is through personal evangelization, through our work in the media or through our involvement in local community organizations, the goal is always the same: to help others come to know and experience the love of God in their lives.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the role of lay people in the Church is an important one, and the role of "Called to Service and Evangelization" is critical to the mission of the Church. As lay people, we have the opportunity to share the message of Christ with others, to serve those in need, and to help build up the Kingdom of God in our world. Let us pray that we may have the courage and the grace to fulfill this role, to the glory of God.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Stay active: The gyms may not be open, however, there are lots of safe alternatives to getting physical activity without going against the preventive best practices recommended by the CDC like social distancing and avoiding large crowds. Aerobics can be done successfully at home. Another important point to consider is that avoiding crowds does not mean avoiding nature. Going for a brisk walk or jog outside in uncrowded areas outdoors is still considered relatively safe.  Push-ups, sit-ups, jumping-jacks and more exercises are great ways to stay fit away from the gym. </p><p></p><p>Adequate sleep: Good sleep is essential to our overall health. According to The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the nation’s leading medical research agency: “Immune system activation alters sleep, and sleep in turn affects the innate and adaptive arm of our body's defense system.”  While the amount of sleep needed for good health and optimum performance mostly depends on the individual, the CDC recommends adults age 18-60 years get seven or more hours of sleep per night.</p><p>Diet and nutrition: Practicing self-discipline and avoiding “emotional eating” due to stress that may be related to the drastic changes surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and how it affects our lives is imperative. According to the CDC, whole foods like dark, leafy greens, oranges and tomatoes—even fresh herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber and minerals. Make it a habit to try to eat more whole nutritious foods instead of processed snacks or fast food.</p><p>Self-care: Take time to take care of yourself. Be supportive and suggest the same for those close to you. Meditation, relaxation, quality time with family, personal care of yourself promotes overall wellness. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) has free, evidence-based, self-care tools developed by psychologists that you can check out here: https://health.mil/About-MHS/OASDHA/Defense-Health-Agency/Operations/Clinical-Support-Division/Connected-Health/mHealth-Clinical-Integration</p><p>Healthcare maintenance: If you have medications prescribed for any condition, be sure to take them as directed by your provider. Chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma and many others should be kept in check with taking your medications as prescribed. Be sure to reach out to your healthcare team with any concerns as well. In the age of COVID-19, telehealth solutions are available if you want to speak with a provider about a health concern unrelated to COVID-19. Madigan patients, for instance, can still utilize Secure Messaging in the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal to request an appointment or call the Puget Sound Military Appointment Center at 1-800-404-4506 to schedule a telehealth appointment.</p><p>Cope with stress and anxiety: Positively cope with stress and anxiety induced by new precautions we must all now take to combat the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. Positive coping mechanisms would include exercise, meditation, reading, further developing certain skills or hobbies etc. Use this era to increase your daily repetition of these positive activities and develop new or even better routines than you may have adhered to prior to the emergence of the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Stay connected: Talking with loved ones while in isolation can help reduce the anxiety and instances of feeling down. Take time to utilize the multitudes of technologies and apps (many free) that can help you stay in touch with those you love. Our busy lives before the COVID-19 may have limited how often we connected with distant loved ones, now’s the time to fully exploit these modern capabilities for fellowship, companionship, and camaraderie.</p><br />
