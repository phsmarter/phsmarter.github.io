                                            As your follow up activity read the conclusion of Cortez (2017) titled "Gay Language: Impact on Colloquial Communication in Barangay Sto. Tomas, City of Binanm Laguna" and replicate the study providing your conclusion and recommendation. Conclusion The following conclusions were derived after analyzing the findings: as to the profile of the respondents, most were relatively under the young adult bracket and the majority of the respondents were female. The majority of the respondents had an outstanding rating in terms of understanding gay language, in terms of acceptability the respondents agreed that they accepted fully gay language and as to usage the respondents fairly agreed that they used gay language sometimes in their daily living. There was no significant difference noted in the impact of gay language on colloquial communication when the respondents were grouped according to age and gender. Recommendation Educators and media need to pay more attention and cultivate awareness to the 20-39 age bracket of the young female as to the proper use of gay language, especially in communication. People should be involved in the issues of using gay language as colloquial communication to protect a safe environment and protect people from bullying and meanness. Gay language can be accepted and used by many people but should be properly guided to avoid offensive language. Further studies maybe conducted to validate the findings of this study.​</a>

The primary subject of this research study will consist of the senior high students enrolled in Antonio A. Maceda integrated school, year 2021-2022 in the city of Manila NCR. The respondents will be limited, only to the boys and girls age of 16-25 years old  who had a past and present relationship as well as in uncommitted relationship. Moreover, the study would be done through the utilization of Data gathering that the researcher had made, so the respondents will be chosen based on their experiences in their partner. With these strategies the researchers will be able to know how the respondents influence on their academic and non academic mean.​</a>

                                            Identify the scope. 
Three limitations of the study are generalized as follows. First, the sample size of this study is small. The subjects in this study were 35 students from two classes in a junior high school in southern Taiwan. The sample for this study was restricted to the urban area. Consequently, it is hard to generalize the study findings to all the EFL students in Taiwan. Second, it is unpredictable whether the subjects respond to the questionnaires honestly. The subject responses to the questionnaires may be out of researcher’s control. Third, owing to the limited time for answering the questionnaires, the format of the questionnaires consists of only 24 questions. Therefore, the study may be not able to comprise all the questions in terms of the students’ attitudes toward a bilingual environment and the means they improve their English learning in a bilingual environment.

Conclusion The following conclusions were derived after analyzing the findings: as to the profile of the respondents, most were relatively under the young adult bracket and the majority of the respondents were female. The majority of the respondents had an outstanding rating in terms of understanding gay language, in terms of acceptability the respondents agreed that they accepted fully gay language and as to usage the respondents fairly agreed that they used gay language sometimes in their daily living. There was no significant difference noted in the impact of gay language on colloquial communication when the respondents were grouped according to age and gender. Recommendation Educators and media need to pay more attention and cultivate awareness to the 20-39 age bracket of the young female as to the proper use of gay language, especially in communication. People should be involved in the issues of using gay language as colloquial communication to protect a safe environment and protect people from bullying and meanness. Gay language can be accepted and used by many people but should be properly guided to avoid offensive language. Further studies maybe conducted to validate the findings of this study.​</h2><br />

The primary subject of this research study will consist of the senior high students enrolled in Antonio A. Maceda integrated school, year 2021-2022 in the city of Manila NCR. The respondents will be limited, only to the boys and girls age of 16-25 years old  who had a past and present relationship as well as in uncommitted relationship. Moreover, the study would be done through the utilization of Data gathering that the researcher had made, so the respondents will be chosen based on their experiences in their partner.

                            9. Identify the scope. 
Three limitations of the study are generalized as follows. First, the sample size of this study is small. The subjects in this study were 35 students from two classes in a junior high school in southern Taiwan. The sample for this study was restricted to the urban area. Consequently, it is hard to generalize the study findings to all the EFL students in Taiwan. Second, it is unpredictable whether the subjects respond to the questionnaires honestly. The subject responses to the questionnaires may be out of researcher’s control. Third, owing to the limited time for answering the questionnaires, the format of the questionnaires consists of only 24 questions. Therefore, the study may be not able to comprise all the questions in terms of the students’ attitudes toward a bilingual environment and the means they improve their English learning in a bilingual environment.
