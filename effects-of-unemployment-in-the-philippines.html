In particular, the unemployment rate followed a dramatic path, increasing from about 8% in 2007 to more than 25% in 2011. The construction sector was hit the hardest: more than 60% of all jobs in this sector were lost by 2013.Footnote1 As a result, employment in this sector decreased from 13% of total employment in 2007 to less than 6% in 2013. The repercussions of the crisis can still be felt today. According to EuroStat, long-term unemployment in Spain is falling but stays high: it was at 7.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately twice the EU15 average for the same period.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>This article shows that the unemployment spells suffered by workers in Spain during the Great Recession led to a drastic relative deterioration of their mental health. Figure 1 presents measures of mental well-being by employment status taken from the Spanish National Health Surveys of 2006 and 2011. Unemployed workers are clearly in worse health than their employed counterparts. They are less self-confident, appear overwhelmed by their problems, and report markedly higher diagnosed mental disorders. However, these are simple correlations and are, therefore, uninformative about the underlying direction of causality. Mental disorders such as depression or chronic anxiety could be the result of unemployment, but it could also be that poor mental health leads to job loss or the inability to find employment.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Unemployment and mental health.

                        People who are unemployed have a tendency to get bored since there is nothing that occupies their time. When unemployed, there is no income so they tend to convert to bad doings just to gain money. As I stated earlier, they have a lot of spare time so some use the spare time to do illegal things for their own pleasure. Specific crimes are stealing, drug usage, holding someone for ransom, invading of private property and etc.<br />

There are hundreds and thousands of people out there who do not have employment. Besides, the problems of unemployment are very severe in India because of the growing population and demand for jobs. Moreover, if we neglect this problem then it will be going to become the reason for the doom of the nation.</p><p></p><p>Unemployment Essay</p><p></p><p>What is Unemployment?</p><p>Unemployment refers to a situation in which a skilled and talented people wanted to do a job. But cannot find a proper job due to several reasons.</p><p></p><p>Types of Unemployment</p><p>Now we know what is unemployment but unemployment does not only mean that the person does not have a job. Likewise, unemployment also includes people working in areas out of their expertise.</p><p></p><p>The various types of unemployment include disguised unemployment, seasonal unemployment, open unemployment, technological unemployment, structural unemployment. Besides, some other unemployment is cyclic unemployment, educated unemployment, underemployment, frictional unemployment, chronic unemployment, and casual unemployment.</p><p></p><p>Above all, seasonal unemployment, under unemployment, and disguised unemployment are the most common unemployment that is found in India.</p><p></p><p>Reasons for Unemployment</p><p>In a country like India, there is much reason for a large section of the population for being unemployed. Some of these factors are population growth, slow economic growth, seasonal occupation, slow growth of the economic sector, and fall in the cottage industry.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these are the major reason for unemployment in India. Also, the situation has become so drastic that highly educated people are ready to do the job of a sweeper. Besides, the government is not doing his work seriously.</p><p></p><p>Apart from all these, a large portion of the population is engaged in the agricultural sector and the sector only provides employment in harvest or plantation time.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the biggest reason of unemployment in India is its vast population which demands a large number of jobs every year which the government and authorities are unable to provide.</p><p></p><p>Consequences of Unemployment</p><p>If things will go on like the current scenario then unemployment will become a major issue. Apart from this, the following things happen in an economy which is an increase in poverty, an increase in crime rate, exploitation of labor, political instability, mental health, and loss of skills. As a result, all this will eventually lead to the demise of the nation.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Unemployment rate is at 5.1%<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Philippines has an <strong>unemployment </strong>rate of 5.1% which means that those who are employed are at 94.9% based on recent statistics. The rate is relatively low compared to other countries. Other nations have as high as 50% rate (in war-torn Syria) while others go as low as .3% in Cambodia.</p><p></p><p>What needs to be looked at, however, is the <strong>underemployment </strong>rate. These are those who are working but are in jobs not in line with what they studied in college. This also means that they are working below what they are capable of. The underemployment rate currently stands at 13.5% which is comparatively high.</p><p></p><p>There is, in contrast, bad underemployment and good underemployment. Bad underemployment happens when the person is underemployed because he or she has no choice, whether because there is no open job positions or he was recently retrenched from a previous post. Good underemployment, on the other hand, is when an engineer for example, decides to become a flower shop owner because that is his passion and it was out of his own free will. </p><p></p><p>As for <strong>unemployment</strong>, this can be solved by preparing potential workers for what is available in the market. There are many job openings but there are only a few who are qualified to take on the job. The job cannot adjust, it should be the applicant. If skills are lacking then skill-building must be done and this is something that the government can work on.</p><p></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p>Unemployment Definition: https://brainly.ph/question/90058</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All developed economies have unemployment benefit programs to protect workers against major income losses during spells of unemployment. By enabling unemployed workers to meet basic consumption needs, the programs protect workers from having to sell their assets or accept jobs below their qualifications. The programs also help stabilize the economy during recessions. If benefits are too generous, however, the programs can lengthen unemployment and raise the unemployment rate. The policy challenge is to protect workers while minimizing undesirable side effects.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) Causes of Rural Unemployment
</p><p>In developing nations, more than 50 percent of the population lives in rural areas. For the rural community, agriculture is the primary job for the people. Rural people do not get the right agricultural jobs, plus they do not get the proper access to education and skills required for getting top-level positions.</p><p>2) Causes of Frictional Unemployment
</p><p>It is a special kind of unemployment. It is also known as search unemployment. It refers to the time gap that occurs when a person shifts from one job to the next.
</p><p>
</p><p>A person who leaves a company or an employed position isn’t immediately employed. It takes some time for them to find another job that suits their interests and set of skills. It might take a week, a month or a year.
</p><p>
</p><p>During this time, people are capable of working and find jobs but do not accept them because they are willing to work for something better.</p><p>3) Causes of Urban Unemployment
</p><p>The number of people living in urban areas that do not have the right jobs is also increasing regularly. Unemployed people in rural areas are also heading towards urban areas. It has been the prime reason behind the urban unemployment.
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, people in urban areas that are not satisfied with their job profile and earnings are part of urban employment. There are some different forms of urban unemployment are there-</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>paki heart po salamat at paki brainliest narin !</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the world today, there are a few common causes of unemployment. Let us look at some of these causes and compare them with some of the causes of unemployment in the Philippines.  </p><p>
</p><p>Common Causes of Unemployment
</p><p>Structural Unemployment
</p><p>
</p><p>Structural unemployment occurs when there are shifts in the demand among the industries. The workforce possesses skills for jobs that were previously high in demand. With the shift in demand for jobs, supply for the jobs that were previously high in demand outstrips the demand for these jobs. As a result, many people become unemployed until market equilibrium is reached, where supply equals demand. Moreover, the jobs that are now high in demand may require skills that the unemployed do not possess. Unless they invest in re-training, which is time consuming, they will find it difficult to find a place for themselves in these jobs because firms prefer employees with the necessary skills and experience.
</p><p>
</p><p>Oversupply of graduates
</p><p>
</p><p>The number of graduates have been increasing over the years. Getting a degree is all too common nowadays. However, the labour force does not require so many graduates. National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan once said that Singapore, which has a significant number of graduates, could not be a nation entirely made up of them. “Can you have a whole country where 100% are graduates? I am not so sure. What you do not want is to create huge graduate unemployment.”
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Economic Recession
</p><p>
</p><p>Economic recession is one of the main causes of unemployment. During a recession, firms experience a decrease in revenue. As profit equals to revenue minus cost, firms would want to cut as much cost as possible. One of the ways to do so is through the retrenchment of employees, where employees deemed to be not productive enough lose their jobs. As this happens, unemployment rates go up.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Causes of Unemployment in the Philippines
</p><p>Unemployment in the Philippines is attributed to reasons including overpopulation, oversupply of labour force on certain industries and the inability to take on available jobs.  </p><p>Overpopulation
</p><p>
</p><p>Philippines has a high population growth rate at an average of 1.7% for the past few years, consistently higher than the world's population growth rate at an average of 1.2%. The high population growth rate which translates to a steady supply of graduates outstrips the rate at which jobs are created, leaving these graduates finding themselves unemployed.
</p><p>
</p><p>Population growth (annual %)
</p><p>Data from World Bank
</p><p>Oversupply of labour force and inability to take on available jobs (structural unemployment)
</p><p>
</p><p>Undergraduates are still taking up college courses that are popular but were previously high in demand. After graduation, these graduates possess skills that are not high in demand in the job market. As such, there is a skill mismatch. For example, in the healthcare industry, nurses were previously in demand abroad. Many undergraduates took up nursing and soon supply matches demand. However, the country's education system continues to produce college graduates who have taken up nursing. As supply increases above demand, there is an oversupply of labour </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

For the poor, labour is often the only asset they can use to improve their well-being. </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When living in impoverished areas individuals experience low-quality housing, underfunded schools and restricted access to public transportation and services.

                            25. the three findings of the study on the effects of unemployment​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Introduction</p><p>In 2009, the United States faced its highest unemployment rates since 1982-1983 with rates reaching or exceeding ten percent in the last three months. From January to December 2009, national unemployment rates increased from 7.7% to 10.0% [1]. During this same time period unemployment rates in Nevada increased from 9.6% to 13.0%, which were the highest in the nation [1].</p><p></p><p>The relationship between unemployment and poor health has been well documented [2–6]. The unemployed tend to have higher levels of impaired mental health including depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as higher levels of mental health hospital admissions, chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and musculoskeletal disorders), and premature mortality [2, 5–12]. Some longitudinal studies have shown that higher levels of depression and unemployment are not just correlated, but that higher levels of depression are a result of unemployment [11, 13, 14]. Other prospective studies have found that poor mental health contributes to unemployment [15]. A study by Montgomery et al. [11] showed that subjects who had recently become unemployed had an adjusted relative risk of 2.10 for depression and anxiety compared to those who had not recently become unemployed. When participants with preexisting depression were excluded from the study, those who had greater than thirty-seven months of accumulated unemployment were two times more apt to be depressed or anxious than were the employed (RR = 2.04). Additionally, unemployment is associated with unhealthy behaviors such as increased alcohol and tobacco consumption and decreased physical activity [9, 16, 17]. Studies have also demonstrated a positive correlation between employment and better health, improved self-confidence, self-esteem, and happiness [9, 18, 19].</p><p></p><p>2. Methods</p><p>2.1. Study Design and Data Collection</p><p></p><p>This study was a secondary analysis of the 2009 Nevada BRFSS survey data. Valuable mental health data is gathered through the administration of the BRFSS. The BRFSS is an annual, national, cross-sectional, random-digit dialing telephone survey that is conducted among noninstitutionalized adults 18 years of age or older in the United States [22]. The survey is a collaborative effort between the states and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Survey questions gather information regarding demographics (age, gender, employment status, income level, education completed, etc.), perceived health status (general health, physical health, and mental health), and chronic disease status and health behaviors (smoking, drinking, physical activity, etc.). The survey includes a core component with questions that are asked to all participants in every state. Core component questions include demographic information and current behaviors that impact health. Time to complete the core component questions is approximately fifteen minutes. Additionally, there are optional modules which the states may elect to fund if there is a special interest. In 2009, BRFSS participants from eight states were asked the optional mental illness questions in addition to the core component items. These states included Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wyoming [22]. We used Nevada for this study because the high rate of unemployment ensured that we had a sufficient sample size (n) for the unemployment groups [1].</p>3. Results<p></p><p>Descriptive statistics of the sample are provided in Table 1 by employment status. Each variable showed significant differences between the groups. A higher proportion of employed and unemployed less than one year participants were male while a higher proportion of unemployed longer than one year and OLF participants were female (</p><p> &lt; 0 . 0 0 1</p><p>). The majority of OLF participants were in the fifties and older age bracket, while a majority of the employed and unemployed participants were in the 24–49 year age bracket (</p><p> &lt; 0 . 0 0 1</p><p>). Employed and OLF participants were more likely to be white as compared with unemployed participants. Employed and OLF participants were less likely to indicate that they were Hispanic, Black, or other ethnicity compared to unemployed participants (</p><p> &lt; 0 . 0 0 1</p><p>). Employed participants were more likely to be in the highest income bracket (&gt;$50.000), while unemployed and OLF participants were more likely to be in the middle income bracket ($20.000–$50.000) (</p><p> &lt; 0 . 0 0 1</p><p>). Employed participants had the highest proportion of participants with some college education (</p><p> &lt; 0 . 0 0 1</p><p>).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if im wrong</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Unemployment and underemployment can have several negative effects on individuals, families, and society as a whole, including:</p><p></p><p>Financial strain: Unemployment and underemployment can lead to financial stress, making it difficult for individuals to meet their basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare. This can also lead to accumulating debt and financial instability.</p><p></p><p>Mental and physical health problems: Individuals who are unemployed or underemployed may experience higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These mental health issues can lead to physical health problems such as hypertension, heart disease, and other stress-related illnesses.</p><p></p><p>Reduced self-esteem and confidence: Being unemployed or underemployed can erode an individual's self-esteem and confidence. This can lead to a sense of hopelessness and feelings of worthlessness.</p><p></p><p>Social isolation: Unemployment and underemployment can result in social isolation and a lack of social support, which can exacerbate mental health problems and increase the risk of substance abuse and other negative coping mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>Reduced economic growth: Unemployment and underemployment can slow down economic growth as it reduces consumer spending and lowers the overall demand for goods and services.</p><p></p><p>Increased crime rates: High rates of unemployment and underemployment can lead to an increase in crime rates, as individuals may resort to illegal means to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Reduced workforce productivity: Underemployment can lead to a reduction in productivity as individuals may not be utilizing their skills and education to their fullest potential. This can also result in a skills gap in the workforce.</p><p></p><p>Overall, unemployment and underemployment can have a range of negative effects on individuals, families, and society. It is important for policymakers to prioritize job creation and support systems for those who are unemployed or underemployed to mitigate these effects</p><br />
