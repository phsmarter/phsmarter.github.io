                                            health is wealth.there is nothing in our life that is more valuable than health. without health, there is no peace, no success and no happiness When we are ill, we do not want to work or play. Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.

                                            thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

Every newexperience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good or bad, each instancechanged the course that my life has taken. But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage.

An honest friend tellsyou the truth even if it’s not always what you want to hear. In the long run, that honest friend mayhave saved you from embarrassment or possibly rejection. They give you constructivecriticisms overall. A loyal friend is the type of friend that will be there for you through thick andthin. They don’t care how good or bad you may look one day; they are sensitive to your feelings,they respect you and the other people in your life, and most of all they will never let you downwhen times are hard. They may be what you call a best friend. The third group, the person thatfits you into their schedule, is the type of person that is always on the go. They barely have timefor themselves let alone another person. More than likely they will not be there for you whenyou need them most, because they are so wrapped up in their busy, hectic life. Then you havethe self-absorbent type of friend that finds time for you only when they need something. Thistype of person isn’t what you would call a friend. This person may always be extremely nice toyou because they know that if they are nice to you then they will more than likely get what theywant. They will call you every once in a while when it is almost time for them to use that personagain. It may be for a ride to work, home or they just want somebody to hang out with becausethey have no other friends. If the person that is being used is smart they will eventually realizethat they are getting used and will stop being there for that person. 1. What are the three types of friends?2.

Essay on Education By: Priyanka Nagrale Countless words are written daily about the importance of education. Indubitably, education is the only valuable asset humans can achieve. Human evolution over eons is a result of education both formal and informal. Further, education is the sole basis on which the future of the human race depends. Our quest for knowledge is unending and will continue till planet Earth exists. How did you find the new information you have learned? I hope that you now pay attention to the basic elements of a position paper. Prepare to examine one in the next activities. Good Luck! Everyone speaks about education and its importance. Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</a>

Be able to explain your answer.1.All of those nights we spent cramming for the test the next morning, all of the books we read and the essays we wrote, all of the lessons we learned from not only our teachers, but our friends as well, all of the friendships/relationships we began, ended and mended, and all of the wonderful and terrrible experiences we have had throughout high school and the other years we spent in K-12 education have led up to this day that we never thought would come so fast.2.No man is an island. Everyone needs someone to depend on. Nobody can live without the help of each other. Be good and be friendly.3.Life is beautiful. Sulking will not do you good. It would just make you sad. Go out and explore the beauty of surroundings. Again, life is beautiful to waste it crying over unimportant things.4.Supressing your anger is not good for any person. It will only make one worse. if you are angry, there are ways to release it in heathy ways. One, write down what you feel at the moment. Spend some time writing about it. This could help ease that heavy feeling in your chest. Second, do physical activities. This can be activities like exercise or any sport. Third, talk to someone about your feeling. Talking will be a big help in easing out your anger.​​</a>

I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Feb 11, 2018·3 min read</p><p></p><p></p><p>Many people have a definition of what the good life means, but what does it really mean to live “a good life”? Is it helping others all of the time and not caring for yourself or Vic versa; being very selfish and having no remorse for others?</p><p>I think there are subjective things that each individual person will have, but I also think there are certain objective things that everyone should have.</p><p>The first thing should be your health. If you are not healthy and taking care of your body everyday, you are on board for a trip to the bottom because as your body degrades, as you get older, all of the unhealthy foods you have been eating and the months you have been putting off the gym will come back to haunt you. Eating healthy and working out is like cheap health insurance that adds up over time. Why wouldn’t you want to take advantage of that? And you see a lot of business people or people in general who work their butts off for money but they get a disease that ruins their quality of life.</p><p>There is this saying when people are younger, they use their health to get wealth and when they are older, they use their wealth to get back their health. It’s a circular logic and circular is illogical in this case.</p><p>And this isn’t just my opinion, there is amazing science to back this up. Weight lifting reverses the age of your telomeres, aerobic exercises help your brain function better, and etc. Even if you don’t have access to a gym, you can always run around your street.</p><p>The second thing you should have is money. Not just to tally it up, but just enough money to tell yourself,” I am financially independent”. You bread people who say ,”Money is the root of all evil”, but I don’t want to say that in a mean way, but money isn’t the root of all evil. Yes to a certain extent, I can see why people would say money is the root of all evil, but the lack of money should be the root of all evil. Just look at rich and poor countries.</p><p></p>ANSWERED BY: HuYiTian94<br />

                            3. what you understand about self-actualization and Good life? 250 w essay​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>One basic way we use the word “good” is to express moral approval. So when we say someone is living well or that they have lived a good life, we may simply mean that they are a good person, someone who is courageous, honest, trustworthy, kind, selfless, generous, helpful, loyal, principled, and so on.</p><p></p><p>They possess and practice many of the most important virtues. And they don’t spend all their time merely pursuing their own pleasure; they devote a certain amount of time to activities that benefit others, perhaps through their engagement with family and friends, or through their work, or through various voluntary activities.</p><p></p><p>This moral conception of the good life has had plenty of champions. Socrates and Plato both gave absolute priority to being a virtuous person over all other supposedly good things such as pleasure, wealth, or power.</p><p></p><p>In Plato’s dialogue Gorgias, Socrates takes this position to an extreme. He argues that it is much better to suffer wrong than to do it; that a good man who has his eyes gouged out and is tortured to death is more fortunate than a corrupt person who has used wealth and power dishonorably.</p><p></p><p>In his masterpiece, the Republic, Plato develops this argument in greater detail. The morally good person, he claims, enjoys a sort of inner harmony, whereas the wicked person, no matter how rich and powerful he may be or how many pleasure he enjoys, is disharmonious, fundamentally at odds with himself and the world.</p><p></p><p>It is worth noting, though, that in both the Gorgias and the Republic, Plato bolsters his argument with a speculative account of an afterlife in which virtuous people are rewarded and wicked people are punished.</p><p></p><p>Many religions also conceive of the good life in moral terms as a life lived according to God’s laws. A person who lives this way—obeying the commandments and performing the proper rituals—is pious. And in most religions, such piety will be rewarded. Obviously, many people do not receive their reward in this life.</p><p></p><p>But devout believers are confident that their piety will not be in vain. Christian martyrs went singing to their deaths confident that they would soon be in heaven. Hindus expect that the law of karma will ensure that their good deeds and intentions will be rewarded, while evil actions and desires will be punished, either in this life or in future lives.</p><br />

                            8. thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It happened a while back.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 7 year old me going with Dad to a swimming pool. It was just him and I that went and so we arrived and settled down. Went down with Dad into the swimming pool and he aided me in swimming. Had a good swim, really enjoyed it, went out of the pool for a break and Dad had to go do something, asking me to remain in place and not to go anywhere. I was a good boy and I obeyed his instructions. However not this time, I had the urge to go back swimming again. Without my Dad's supervision, I entered the water slowly, submerged in the water, heads up, hands stretching out to the sides of the pool for support. So I started moving my hands, one by one, by the side of the pool, forth and back several times. I did so until I was confident (for no logical reason) that I am able to swim without any support, just by randomly flapping my arms and legs I'll do fine. I pushed away from the side of the pool completely unaware of the consequences (1.5 meters deep, no life vest, absolutely inexperienced in swimming). Randomly moving my limbs, vigorously, confident that I'll be able to keep my head above the surface; I did, for a few seconds and inevitably found myself drowning. Lucky enough to take a breath without swallowing water, held my breath and submerged. The surprising thing is that I had no feelings of fear, shock or whatsoever. I felt calm, so calm that I didn't resistant fighting back to the surface. My head was up throughout the time I was sinking, sinking slowly. I can still remember how that as if it was as if I felt safe, not worried about dying, as if accepting faith. I still didn't feel that I was running out of breath throughout the time, it was a miracle that I didn't for at least half a minute. A man was passing by and from his point of view he noticed a young figure submerged under the water, aware that this kid might actually need help. Feeling pity, he reached his hand into the water and I have seen the hand reach out to me as it grabs me and pulls me out to the light. I don't remember what happened next but the man was my Dad, breaking down into tears after discovering that he rescued and saved me by chance, having no idea it was me.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, with millions of people around the world using it to connect, share information, and stay informed. While social media can have many positive effects, it also has some negative effects that should be considered.</p><p></p><p>One of the most obvious effects of social media is its ability to connect people from different parts of the world. Social media platforms allow people to connect with friends and family members who live far away, as well as to connect with people who share similar interests. This can help to build strong, supportive communities and to foster a sense of belonging.</p><p></p><p>Another effect of social media is its ability to influence our behavior. Studies have shown that people who spend more time on social media are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. This is thought to be because social media can be a powerful influence on our perceptions of what is normal and acceptable. Additionally, social media can be used to promote unhealthy products and lifestyles, which can further contribute to risky behavior.</p><p></p><p>However, social media also has some positive effects. It is a great tool for learning, as it allows users to access a vast array of information and resources. Social media platforms also serve as a platform for activism, by providing a platform for people to raise awareness about social issues and to make their voices heard.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, social media has both positive and negative effects on individuals and society as a whole. While it can be a great tool for connecting with others, it also has the potential to influence our behavior in negative ways. It is important for users to be mindful of the potential negative effects of social media and to use it in a responsible and healthy way.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>how about this po?</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The book of Matthew is one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is believed to have been written by Matthew, a disciple of Jesus, and is primarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The book contains the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of the Kingdom" due to its emphasis on the coming of the Kingdom of God.</p><p></p><p>The book of Mark is also one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Mark, a disciple of Peter, and is primarily focused on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. The book contains Jesus' baptism, temptation, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Action" due to its emphasis on Jesus' deeds rather than his words.</p><p></p><p>The book of John is another one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by John, a disciple of Jesus, and is primarily focused on the divinity of Jesus Christ. The book contains Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Belief" due to its emphasis on the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God.</p><p></p><p>The book of Luke is the third Gospel book in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Luke, a physician and companion of Paul, and is primarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The book contains the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Mercy" due to its emphasis on Jesus' compassion and concern for the poor and marginalized.</p><p></p><p>One of the most well-known Bible verses about the Gospel is John 3:16, which states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse highlights the central message of the Gospel, which is that through faith in Jesus Christ, we can be saved and have eternal life.</p><p></p><p>The Gospel is of utmost importance in the life of Christians because it contains the message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. It provides guidance, comfort, and hope to believers, and helps them to live a life in accordance with God's will.</p><p></p><p>At this moment in my life, the most significant Bible verse that I would use to communicate is Philippians 4:6-7, which states, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." This verse reminds us to trust in God and to bring our worries and concerns to Him in prayer.</p><p></p><p>To help my family read the Bible well, I can encourage them to set aside a specific time each day for Bible reading and prayer, and to choose a Bible study plan or devotional to follow. I can also discuss and reflect on the passages with them to deepen our understanding and share our insights.</p><p></p><p>In this pandemic time, I can apply the teachings of the Gospel by showing compassion and kindness to those who are affected by the virus, and by trusting in God's plan and His protection.</p><p></p><p>Dear God, we pray for your protection and good health during this pandemic time. May you guard our hearts and minds and keep us safe</p><br />

Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending.

                            20. Friends can be classified according to their honesty, loyalty, the type that fits you into theirschedule, or the type that finds time for you when they need something. An honest friend tellsyou the truth even if it’s not always what you want to hear. In the long run, that honest friend mayhave saved you from embarrassment or possibly rejection. They give you constructivecriticisms overall. A loyal friend is the type of friend that will be there for you through thick andthin. They don’t care how good or bad you may look one day; they are sensitive to your feelings,they respect you and the other people in your life, and most of all they will never let you downwhen times are hard. They may be what you call a best friend. The third group, the person thatfits you into their schedule, is the type of person that is always on the go. They barely have timefor themselves let alone another person. More than likely they will not be there for you whenyou need them most, because they are so wrapped up in their busy, hectic life. Then you havethe self-absorbent type of friend that finds time for you only when they need something. Thistype of person isn’t what you would call a friend. This person may always be extremely nice toyou because they know that if they are nice to you then they will more than likely get what theywant. They will call you every once in a while when it is almost time for them to use that personagain. It may be for a ride to work, home or they just want somebody to hang out with becausethey have no other friends. If the person that is being used is smart they will eventually realizethat they are getting used and will stop being there for that person. 1. What are the three types of friends?2. What is the basis used by the author to classify friends?3. What kind of essay is it?4. Do you agree with the idea of the author? Why or why not?5. Does it follow the properties of well written text?

Be convincing. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is true that many elder people talk about their good old days before, especially most of them is all about how they work hard and there were no advanced technologies and easier ways to help themselves out in their life. Telling them to their kids or grandchildren means that they were just telling what it was like when it was in their generation. It really is a bit of comparing, but it's just stating both differences and improvements in both generations.</p><p></p><p>Neither of the generation ( old and new ) are perfect and different, but somehow they see the new ones as a harder and more challenging generation, especially our generation now. As what I've experienced from my grandparents and parents, they do tell about their generation but they were also telling it in a way of life's secret lessons, in which thet are explaining it to us, younger ones. I personally think that every generation is not easy, since life isn't easy, but the more years grow the more harder it gets they say. That is why our parents and grandparents are here with us, to help us and guide us what to do in our generation in order to be prepared for the struggles in life.</p><br />

Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</h2><br />

My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well.

Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well.
