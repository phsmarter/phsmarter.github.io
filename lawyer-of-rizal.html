                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Defend Rizal as his defense lawyer? On a trial of rebellion, yes. But that trial must be by a civilian court, either in a primer instancia or direct to a special court handling rebellion cases. It must not be a Court Martial or a Military Commission reporting direct to a military governor general.But as things stand in 1896, poor Jose was a cooked goose. The Court Martial has to have the usual suspects, and our doctor-poet-lover (not to say with two novels) and reluctant rebel got a slim margin between the devil and the deep blue sea.The defense will be along the lines of evidence need to convict a person with rebellion charges. Witnesses of the prosecution will be put on the dock and subjected to withering cross-examination questions and physical evidence will be subjected to minute scrutiny, all in accordance with the existing Rules of Court; not in a court martial which fashion its Rules as the trial moves.The 1896 court martial was designed to convict and execute. Eventually, Spain lost her empire.</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It wouldn’t be a defense so much as a strategy.
