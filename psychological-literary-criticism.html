                        <p></p><p>The text "All these Fighting Cocks" can be interpreted through a gender criticism lens, as it explores the toxic masculinity and violence associated with cockfighting. The narrator, a young boy, is eager to prove his masculinity by participating in the violent sport, despite his mother's disapproval. The male characters in the story view the roosters as extensions of themselves, and derive pleasure from the brutal fights.</p><p></p><p>Through a psychological criticism approach, the story can be seen as a depiction of the effects of toxic masculinity on young boys. The narrator idolizes his father and grandfather, who are both involved in cockfighting, and feels the need to prove himself to them. The violent nature of the sport also serves as an outlet for the emotions that the male characters struggle to express in a healthy manner.</p><p></p><p>From a sociological criticism perspective, the story highlights the cultural significance of cockfighting in certain communities. The rural setting and the men's devotion to the sport can be seen as a representation of the traditions and values that are deeply ingrained in certain regions. The story also brings to light the issue of animal cruelty and the ethical implications of participating in this type of activity.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "All these Fighting Cocks" portrays the harmful effects of toxic masculinity and the cultural significance of certain traditions, while also shedding light on the issue of animal cruelty.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Psychological Criticism</strong>, also known as <strong>Psychoanalytical Criticism</strong>, is the analysis of an author's unintended message. The analysis focuses on the biographical circumstances of an author. The main goal is <strong>to</strong> <strong>analyze the unconscious elements</strong> within a literary text based on the background of the author.</p><p>example: The Lion King</p><p></p><p><strong>Biographical criticism</strong> asserts that an author's own life must affect his or her work</p><p>example: Jack compares to Hitler in his seizure of power, promise of food and a better life, and his development of a scapegoat: the beast. These methods, in the quote, "I gave you food...and my hunters will protect you from the beast.</p><br />

Psychological research on gender,which has most often focused on analysis of sex differences, within-sex variability, and gender roles,has begun to incorporate this new understanding. By drawing on three resources, psychologists can make more rapid progress in understanding gender's significance for psychological processes: social science theories that link the individual and social levels of analysis; constructs (such as identity) that bridge the social and individual levels; and conceptual tools generated in feminist theory, perhaps especially intersectional.<p></p><p></p><p>     -hope it helps :)</p><br />
