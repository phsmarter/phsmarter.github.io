Write your answer on the space provided before the number.__________ 1. Effective classroom management principles work across almost all subject areas and grade levels (Brophy, 2006; Lewis, et al., 2006).__________ 2. Although effective classroom management produces a variety of positive outcomes for students, according to a 2006 survey of pre-K through grade 12 teachers conducted by APA, teachers report a lack of support in implementing classroom management strategies.__________ 3. Chaotic classroom environments are a large issue for teachers and can contribute to high teacher stress and burnout rates.__________ 4. It is important to use effective classroom management strategies at the universal level in a tiered model, as they serve as both prevention and intervention methods that promote positive outcomes for teachers. __________ 5. At the school wide level, teachers and staff create a positive school culture by clearly defining positive expectations that are taught to all students and adults (Bradshaw, 2014).__________ 6. Teachers should assume that students know the appropriate and expected classroom behaviors. Instead, teachers should make it a priority to help their students understand what appropriate classroom behaviors are and make this information explicit.__________ 7. Make your classroom goals easy to understand and measurable (e.g., if your goal is to "be respectful" make sure your students know what that means. Provide them examples of negative behaviors that you expect from them).__________ 8. Most classroom teachers have trained in functional assessment or analysis of behavior, so it is important that they consult with their colleagues (e.g., school psychologists, special education teachers) who have expertise in this area. __________ 9. Large group instruction can be established for students who need to focus on specific skills to improve and manage their classroom behavior.__________ 10. Research indicates that classroom management systems are effective in managing student behavior and learning because they sustain an orderly learning environment for students, enhance students' academic skills and competencies, and further social and emotional development.​</a>

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

Effective classroom management principles work across almost all subject areas and grade levels (Brophy, 2006; Lewis, et al., 2006).__________ 2. Although effective classroom management produces a variety of positive outcomes for students, according to a 2006 survey of pre-K through grade 12 teachers conducted by APA, teachers report a lack of support in implementing classroom management strategies.__________ 3. Chaotic classroom environments are a large issue for teachers and can contribute to high teacher stress and burnout rates.__________ 4. It is important to use effective classroom management strategies at the universal level in a tiered model, as they serve as both prevention and intervention methods that promote positive outcomes for teachers. __________ 5. At the school wide level, teachers and staff create a positive school culture by clearly defining positive expectations that are taught to all students and adults (Bradshaw, 2014).__________ 6. Teachers should assume that students know the appropriate and expected classroom behaviors. Instead, teachers should make it a priority to help their students understand what appropriate classroom behaviors are and make this information explicit.__________ 7. Make your classroom goals easy to understand and measurable (e.g., if your goal is to "be respectful" make sure your students know what that means. Provide them examples of negative behaviors that you expect from them).__________ 8. Most classroom teachers have trained in functional assessment or analysis of behavior, so it is important that they consult with their colleagues (e.g., school psychologists, special education teachers) who have expertise in this area. __________ 9. Large group instruction can be established for students who need to focus on specific skills to improve and manage their classroom behavior.__________ 10. Research indicates that classroom management systems are effective in managing student behavior and learning because they sustain an orderly learning environment for students, enhance students' academic skills and competencies, and further social and emotional development.​</h2><br />

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."
