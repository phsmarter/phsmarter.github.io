We all gathered together in the kitchen and worked together to make a delicious Christmas dinner. We also enjoyed a festive movie night with our favorite holiday films. On Christmas morning, we exchanged gifts and enjoyed the happy atmosphere that surrounded us. After that, we spent time playing board games and having conversations about our plans for the New Year.

                            4. Create an essay applying the two theories discussed (Structural Functionalism and Marxism) in connection with the celebration of the Holidays (Christmas Season) in the Philippines</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Christmas in the Philippines (Filipino: Pasko sa Pilipinas), one of two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia (the other one being East Timor), is one of the biggest holidays in the country. The country celebrates the world's longest Christmas season,[1] with Christmas carols heard as early as September and lasting variously until either Epiphany, the Feast of the Black Nazarene on January 9, or the Feast of the Santo Niño on the third Sunday of January. The official observance by the Catholic Church in the Philippines is from the beginning of the Simbang Gabi on December 16 until the Feast of the Epiphany on the first Sunday after the New Year.
</p><p>
</p><p>Every year, Filipinos from around the world mark September 1 as the beginning of the countdown to Christmas. This countdown, which spans from September to December, otherwise known as the "Ber Months", is one of the most important traditions that make the world's earliest and longest timespan of a Christmas season.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Christmas season gradually starts from September to December and ends in the third or fourth week of January. It is celebrated for almost half a year (4 months and 3–4 weeks or 5 months). Generally, holiday decorations are available as early as the National Heroes' Day weekend in August. But for the Iglesia Filipina Independiente or Aglipayans, Christmas starts on the eve of December 24 and ends on New Year's Day on January 1.</p><p>Both are DETERMINISTIC approaches, seeing individuals as passive and controlled, as if like puppets, by society.
</p><p>Both theories are IDEOLOGICAL, stating that society is maintained by systems of prevailing ideas and beliefs.
</p><p>Both Marxism and functionalism argue the importance of SOCIALISATION in the maintenance of society.
</p><p>The STRUCTURE of society shapes us as individuals not vice versa.
</p><p>Both theories are MACRO-PERSPECTIVES- studying the whole of society.
</p><p>Both theories suggest a degree of SOCIAL OBJECTIVITY. They reify society suggesting that it moves under its own force, it is not reliant on humanity.
</p><p>Functionalism and Marxism agree that social life operates on the principles of CAUSE AND EFFECT. Everything within society is caused by something else.
</p><p>Both theories are POSITIVISTIC. They emphasise empiricism and a belief in the scientific study of society.</p><p></p><br />

                            5. "The New Christmas Of Peace, Love &amp; Unity" essay 300 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Christmas is the season of joy, peace, and happiness. It is the special season set aside to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. Though this was its original purpose, the celebration of Christmas has grown to become a symbolic time for living in peace and love.
Christmas is essentially a reminder of why we should stick to the deepest parts of our humanity. That is, through celebration, we are reminded that we should share, give to the less privileged, spend time with loved ones and have a positive outlook about life in general.
Many people assume Christmas is strictly a Christian celebration and they would be right if modern evidence is to be considered. However, with regards to its origin, this notion cannot be farther from the truth. In actual sense, Christmas originated a few decades after the birth of Jesus in the old Roman Empire.
Christmas emanated as the Pagan celebration of the concept known as Saturnalia. This celebration was aimed at celebrating the return of the sun and the end of winter. The celebration is usually a weeklong affair and is marked by lawless activity and a system of penal exemption from lawless acts such as housing breaking.  In the 4th century, Christians adapted the last day of Saturnalia to be the celebration of Christmas. The aim was to get the pagans to associate this period with positive things. Consequently, lots of pagans converted to Christianity on the promise that they could still celebrate their tradition in this day. Whether Jesus was actually born on the 25 of December is not substantiated by historical evidence.  Why do we celebrate Christmas? Why do we go the extra mile to celebrate, give and create an atmosphere of merriment? The answers to these questions are numerous but we would mention a few.
Christmas reminds us of the importance of giving and sharing with friends and family.  Christmas shows the importance of joy and happiness.   Through Christmas, we know that Jesus birth is the beginning of great things in the world.  It is also an opportunity to correct actions we aren’t proud of in our lives. It is generally an opportunity to think about nature and the reason for our existence.  
Whether you’re Christian or not, Christmas is an opportunity for you to put your biases and ill thought behind in the celebration of a great cause.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Christmas is the most important festival among Christians. It is celebrated to mark the birth of Jesus, who is the supreme lord of the Christians. It marks the beginning of the days of hope for those oppressed before the birth of Jesus. Christmas celebrates the spirit of joy and merry-making.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Writing about a holiday experience with my aunt's family can be a fun and rewarding experience. I can recall a few years ago when I was invited to spend a week with them in their home in the countryside. It was a beautiful place, surrounded by lush green hills and tall, majestic trees. From the moment I arrived, I was welcomed warmly and made to feel like part of the family.</p><p></p><p>Days were spent exploring the area and trying out the local cuisine. One evening, we drove to the nearby lake and spent the night under the stars, laughing, talking and watching the stars twinkle in the night sky. We shared stories about our childhoods, our families and our dreams for the future. It was a magical night that I will never forget.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the week was filled with moments of laughter, conversation and genuine care. We went on hikes in the mountains, visited nearby villages and, of course, cooked delicious meals together. I was touched by how my aunt and her family opened up their home and lives to me with such ease and warmth.</p><p></p><p>I am so grateful to my aunt and her family for this amazing experience. Writing about it has reminded me of the special bond I have with them, and the importance of spending time together with the ones we love.</p><br />

                        <p><strong> My 2022 Christmas day is one of the most memorable happenings in my life. A few days before christmas, i could barely see people decorating for christmas. I couldn't feel the Christmas spirit, till my relatives came. Some of them were unknown to me, but despite that, I had a lot of fun! I thought i was getting older cause i couldn't feel the spirit of christmas spirit, but then the caroling started, and it was interesting to see everyones perfromaces. It was nice seeing young and old people caroling, they spent alot of their time and energy into caroling even if they're not sure they'll even get something for it. I think i learned something this christmas, and its that the christmas spirit is not obtained by presents, or the decorations of houses surrounding you, but its about the people you love and cherish that are there to enjoy their christmas day with you. That is how christmas is enjoyed.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>MY CHRISTMAS BREAK </strong></p><p></p><p>During Christmas break I spent quality time with my family. Our Christmas traditions involve us all gathering around the dinner table to exchange gifts. I then go on to organize a fun activity for us all to take part in, such as a movie night, dinner out or a game of charades. I also look forward to baking a variety of Christmas treats with my siblings. Christmas baking is a tradition for my family and it is always a great way to spend extra time with the ones we love. </p><p></p><p>I love to go holiday shopping for friends and family and this year I was able to buy them lovely personalized gifts. Spending the Christmas money that I saved throughout the year was one of the most thrilling parts of the season. Christmas break is also a great time for me to relax and slow down from the hectic school year. I was able to dedicate some time to myself, my music and my hobbies. </p><p></p><p>This Christmas, I was also able to spend a few days with my grandparents. I got to catch up with them, hear their life stories and treasure their wise advice. We spent many long days having conversations as well as enjoying one another’s presence. I also got to explore the nearby town and take many pictures with my family.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, I used this break to think about what I want to do in the future, do some unfinished homework and projects that I haven't done yet. I also subscribed to several blogs which were informative and helped me gain knowledge about areas I’m particularly interested in. </p><p></p><p>In short, I made the most out of my Christmas break by engaging in many interesting activities, from leisurely activities such as baking and exploring, to think about the courses I want to take in the future and learning more about the areas that i’m interested in. I am sure I will look back fondly on my Christmas break and all the amazing experiences I had during it.</p><p></p><p><strong>words - 342</strong></p><p><strong>characters - 1,845</strong></p><p></p><p>(hope this helps you!:))</p><br />

                        <strong>How I spent all soul and saints day.</strong><p></p><p>Since childhood, my family has always followed the celebration of the day of souls and saints. The holy day is usually celebrated on November 1 every year to celebrate the feast of the saints. Usually, my family and I would attend Mass together. Through Mass, we and the saints in heaven praise and glorify the name of God. We also had discussions about the journey and way of life of the saints. Usually, the thing we would definitely do near the end of the day was praying together. In every celebration of any day, my family has a habit of always eating together, so today we gather and eat together while discussing many things.</p><p></p><p>After that, the next day on November 2 every year, we also celebrate soul day. I was told that this day is celebrated to remember and offer prayers for the souls of all the believers who have died around the world. On this day my family and I will also attend Mass together. After that, we will visit our family's graves with flowers to decorate the graves. We used to visit the graves of our grandparents and uncles. We usually also clean our family's graves at the same time. And then we pray together for our deceased relatives in the hope that they will be in heaven and join the saints. We also pray that when we can reunite with them all in heaven. Usually, my extended family will gather in one of the family members' houses, we will eat together while remembering the people we love. In my opinion, celebrating the day of the soul is more fun if it is done with extended family because we can strengthen each other and pray for our loved ones together.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about all soul's day</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/12432020</p><p><strong>#SPJ9</strong></p><br />

Who would have thought that the COVID-19 pandemic would affect all the plans, parties, reunions, even so, our way of celebrating Christmas? Different from past holidays when parties and gatherings were done carefree, this year we won’t be able to. It’s unfortunate that we are unable to spend time with our loved ones and friends. Albeit this, safety is now our highest priority.
</p><p>
</p><p>With the restrictions imposed by the government, such as social distancing, there are various alternatives to enjoy this holiday season and observe safety protocols at the same time. With the EGP team working from home, we took the chance to ask them how they plan to celebrate this Christmas amidst the pandemic.</p><p></p><p> Virtual Party: Another alternative for EGP employees is to celebrate this Christmas virtually through video meetings. There are tons of video meeting platforms to choose from. Thanks to these applications, the distance between you and your loved ones is just a screen away. Aside from catching up through conversations, you can play virtual games and watch movies together.</p><p></p><p>One thing that is certain, we know that adjusting to change can be challenging. Be it planned or unplanned, gradual or sudden, change is inevitable and very much part of being human. Over the past few months, we’ve experienced an unprecedented shift in our way of life due to COVID-19. Pre-pandemic, who would’ve thought that toilet paper could become as precious as gold! And now, a trip to do a weekly grocery shop seems like an adventure of its own! Before we know it, we’ve let go of our old normal and now settling into what seems to be our new normal.  </p><p>
</p><p>Even when society starts up again, there will still be restrictions and we are facing fundamental shifts to our way of life. So, what does a New Normal look like?</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
