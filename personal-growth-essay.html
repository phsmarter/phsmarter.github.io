Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                                            How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</a>

                        <p><strong>What is original sin?
</strong></p><p><strong>Original sin is an Augustine Christian doctrine that says that everyone is born sinful. This means that they are born with a built-in urge to do bad things and to disobey God. It is an important doctrine within the Roman Catholic Church. The concept of Original Sin was explained in depth by St Augustine and formalised as part of Roman Catholic doctrine by the Councils of Trent in the 16th Century.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Original sin is not just this inherited spiritual disease or defect in human nature; it's also the 'condemnation' that goes with that fault.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>An explanation for the evils of the world
</strong></p><p><strong>Some Christians believe that original sin explains why there is so much wrong in a world created by a perfect God, and why people need to have their souls 'saved' by God.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>A condition you're in, not something you do
</strong></p><p><strong>Original sin is a condition, not something that people do: It's the normal spiritual and psychological condition of human beings, not their bad thoughts and actions. Even a newborn baby who hasn't done anything at all is damaged by original sin.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The sin of Adam
</strong></p><p><strong>In traditional Christian teaching, original sin is the result of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God when they ate a forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p></p><p>Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights, focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems. Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.[3] Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have the obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights.[4] Human rights cannot be separated from the societal contexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, which include the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancing their ability to participate as active members of society.[5] Such an understanding of social rights calls our attention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the “collective.”[6] Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rights is not optional.[7] In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respect and protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic and social rights for all.</p><br />

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />

                            14. informative essay about Why Self-Love is Key to Personal Growth and Happiness"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>nn</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Self-love refers to the act of accepting, valuing, and caring for oneself. It is a fundamental aspect of personal growth and happiness, as it enables individuals to feel more confident and satisfied with themselves and their lives. In this essay, we will explore the importance of self-love and how it can contribute to personal growth and happiness.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, self-love is essential for personal growth. When individuals love themselves, they are more likely to take care of themselves and prioritize their needs. This can include engaging in self-care activities, setting boundaries, and pursuing their passions and interests. By doing so, individuals can develop a stronger sense of identity and purpose, which can lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and happiness.</p><p></p><p>Self-love also plays a critical role in building resilience and coping with life's challenges. When individuals love themselves, they are more likely to be kind and compassionate to themselves when they make mistakes or experience setbacks. Rather than getting stuck in negative self-talk or self-blame, individuals with self-love are more likely to see these experiences as opportunities for growth and learning. As a result, they can bounce back more quickly and effectively from difficult situations.</p><p></p><p>In addition to personal growth, self-love is also a key component of happiness. Research has consistently shown that individuals with higher levels of self-esteem and self-worth are more likely to experience greater levels of happiness and life satisfaction.

                            16. How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</h2><br />

It is defined as the inability to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and education. However, poverty is much more than just a lack of money. It is hunger, sickness, unemployment, lack of access to education and healthcare, and living one day at a time. Therefore, poverty requires urgent attention from everyone, and it is not just the problem of the poor individual, but also the entire nation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, many people have the misconception that poverty is a choice made by the poor. They believe that poor people should just work harder to improve their lives. However, this is not always the case. In many situations, the poor lack access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities, which makes it difficult for them to escape poverty. It is not fair to judge people in poverty without understanding the structural and systemic issues that contribute to their plight.</p><p></p><p>To eradicate poverty, effective measures must be implemented by the government and society at large. These measures should focus on providing access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities to the poor.

It is not just the problem of the poor individual, but also the entire nation.

Burnout; Nervous Breakdown; Major Depressive Episode. The health professionals all had different labels. The truth was, I was broken. Pride comes before the fall. Here was the inevitable fall. In the matter of a single moment sitting in front of my computer screen, my entire life changed course. Nothing would ever be the same again. I did not realize it at the time and thought that a day off was all that was required. It was not to be. The psychologist had a serious talk to me and I realized the seriousness of the situation I found myself in. I kept wondering how I had missed all the signs? It was plain to see, constant high blood pressure, inability to sleep, growing anxiety, lack of boundaries, stress, the list was almost endless.</p><p></p><p>My journey had begun.</p><p></p><p>For the first time that I can recall I had no destination in mind. I was broken. I did not want to be anywhere or do anything. I had lost the will to live and I didn’t care. Looking back at that time I don’t even recall having thoughts. I either lay in bed or sat on a chair under a blanket. I simply existed, as if in some strange comatose state, whether this was brought on by the breakdown or the handful of tablets that I was required to take every day I am not sure. None the less I was little more than an inanimate object. My fiancé took great care of me, prepared meals, handled whatever business fallouts were taking place, encouraging me to rest and give it time, inviting me to try to make tiny steps towards recovery.</p><p></p><p>This was not how I imagined the journey would be. After all, when they say that it is about the journey, not the destination, one would think that the journey should at least be enjoyable. I could find absolutely no joy in anything.</p><p></p><p>There is also a saying that: “every cloud has a silver lining.” Fortunately, that has also proven to be true for me. My brother in law bought me a return ticket to go visit them in India, and I accepted the gift as I needed to just get away from the world. In March this year, I nervously embarked on a journey to go spend some time with them in India. I did not have any plans to do anything in India, and the main reason for me going was just to get away from everything for a while. Even if the only thing I did whilst I was in India was stay in their house for 6 weeks that would have worked for me.</p><p></p><p>Something inside me shifted though. The moment I said goodbye to my fiancé and stepdaughter and walked through to departures I knew that I was on my own from here. I knew that it was now up to me to create the context for how this journey would unfold.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong># Carry On learning</strong><br />
