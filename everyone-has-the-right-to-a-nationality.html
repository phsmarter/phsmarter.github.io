                                            Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants?                            Excerpt from an essay written by Kris GledhillAfter England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day" Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people.Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method"Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee.So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing.In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included.We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene?Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures" The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal.1. What is the editorial's main point?2. Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.3.

                                            What's the summary of Hyde Park by Petina Gappah?
	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.
London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.
As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.
I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.
I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.
I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.
Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity
It is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.
I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.

                                            Learning Task 7. Below is Donald Trump's speech on January 13, 2021 condemning violence onthe US Capitol. Read it intently and critically. Note all the blases and prejudices contained in thepiingbericsideMy follow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of thepast week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of ourRepublic. It ongered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want tobe very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence andvandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacredtraditions and valuos, Mob violenco goes against everything I believe in and everything ourmovement stands for, No true supporter of mine could over endorse political violence. No truesupporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No truesupporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their follow Americans. If you do any of thesethings, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking ourcountry. We cannot tolerato it.Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, wehave seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs,too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or onthe left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, noexceptions, America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will bebrought to justiceNow I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of waysto ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has beenreporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here inWashington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on thepotential threats, Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must beno violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind,Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I havedirected federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington,D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensurethat a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked anddeeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds ofmillions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm,moderation and grace, We will get through this challenge just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech wehave seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel andblacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us tolisten to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to riseabove the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancingthe interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic,rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and jointogether as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of ourfarnílies, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America,dt​</a>

Give an example of a figurative language used in the literary piece and identify its kind. 3. Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</a>

                                            C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

                            11. What's the summary of Hyde Park by Petina Gappah?
	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.
London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.
As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.
I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.
I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.
I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.
Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity
It is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.
I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.

                            15. Learning Task 7. Below is Donald Trump's speech on January 13, 2021 condemning violence onthe US Capitol. Read it intently and critically. Note all the blases and prejudices contained in thepiingbericsideMy follow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of thepast week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of ourRepublic. It ongered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want tobe very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence andvandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacredtraditions and valuos, Mob violenco goes against everything I believe in and everything ourmovement stands for, No true supporter of mine could over endorse political violence. No truesupporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No truesupporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their follow Americans. If you do any of thesethings, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking ourcountry. We cannot tolerato it.Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, wehave seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs,too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or onthe left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, noexceptions, America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will bebrought to justiceNow I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of waysto ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has beenreporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here inWashington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on thepotential threats, Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must beno violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind,Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I havedirected federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington,D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensurethat a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked anddeeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds ofmillions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm,moderation and grace, We will get through this challenge just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech wehave seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel andblacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us tolisten to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to riseabove the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancingthe interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic,rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and jointogether as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of ourfarnílies, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America,dt​</h2><br />

Give 2 other topics that can be featured in creative-nonfiction"Hyde Park" By: Petina Gappah	I was a student when I made my first visit to London. It was the summer of 1997, I was poor and on a budget. I came just for the day, on a National Express coach from Cambridge. I was a little uneasy because the driver spoke loudly in a cockney accent, had a shaven head and tattoos that snaked up his arms from his wrists and disappeared into his short sleeves. Dark thoughts of what skinheads did to black people in Europe entered my mind. “Here you go darlin’,” he said as he handed me my change. I was disarmed.London lived in my imagination long before I saw it. On that first visit, I wanted to see everything. From the top of several “hop on, hop off” buses, I saw Pudding Lane and Westminster Abbey, the Old Bailey, the sparkling, dirty Thames and the many sights and places that I knew from books and television. By four in the afternoon, I was London-glutted and sight-sore. “Coming up is Marble Arch,” said our tour guide. I immediately thought of Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah”. My best friend David Ottewell had introduced me to his music the month before, only for Buckley to drown a few weeks after I first heard him. I hopped off the bus and walked into Hyde Park from the Marble Arch entrance. It was as good a place as any to eat my sandwich lunch.As I walked into the park, I almost became part of a crowd of Hare Krishna followers. The small enthusiastic crowd was mainly middle-aged, the men in white linen trousers and tunics, the women looking incongruous in clothes from two continents separated by a vast ocean: they wore saris accessorised with colourful woven bags from Latin America. They thrust up their arms and danced their way through the park as everyone but the tourists ignored them.I walked away from the Hare Krishnas and found myself at Speakers’ Corner. I listened to a bearded Christian evangelist preaching hell and brimstone in such soft tones that he did not appear to be particularly convinced of the impending doom he prophesied. There was also a member of the International Socialists organisation, who talked as though the Berlin Wall was still to fall, and a group of students campaigning against a multinational that was forcing infant formula on women in developing countries, making me feel terribly guilty because all I could think of was one of the multinational’s famed chocolate bars.I took that as a prompt to have my late lunch, and walked to eat it in the loveliness of the Rose Garden. After my meal, I turned right and found myself in Rotten Row. I felt immediately homesick for Zimbabwe. There are not many Rotten Rows in the world, and one of them is in Harare. I spent an hour wandering in a happy daze in Hyde Park.I have visited Hyde Park many times since then, and have come to love other sights that I missed that day — particularly the moving Holocaust Memorial with its text from the Book of Lamentations — but the charm of the first visit has never left me.Speakers’ Corner speaks to the quality I love most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricityIt is one of my favourite places in London. Speakers’ Corner is famously associated with freedom of speech but, to me, it speaks to the quality that I love the most about the British: their tolerance for eccentricity. And that day showed me another quality that I love in big-city dwellers — not just Londoners but those of other big cities too. Coming from a city in the guise of a village, where to be present is to invite attention and loud comment on your clothes, your hair, your very being, I loved that there was an accepted code of behaviour about being private in public, and that I could disappear into my own world in the middle of a communal park.I love Hyde Park also because it reminds me of home, not only because of Rotten Row but because it gives me an idea of what my city’s planners had in mind when they put the Harare Gardens, my city’s largest park, in the middle of the city. As I left the park through Hyde Park Corner that day in 1997, I walked away with an idea in my mind of the kind of place that my city could have become, of the kind of place that Harare still could be when, and if ever, it grows up.​</h2><br />

                            26. C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

</p>1.	What is the editorial’s main point?  <p>The central point of the editorial is to question whether United Kingdom should be accounted for causing the rising of cases and deaths due to COVID19. Although they are among the countries who have launched the vaccination drive, the new variant has originated from their country.  </p><p>
</p>2.	Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.  Among these evidences are;
<p>a.	UK’s premature lifting of COVID19 protocols
