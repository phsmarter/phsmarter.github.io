                                            Duterte overturns task force decision to allow 10 to 14-year-olds outside
"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte re-imposed the stay-at-home rules for 10 to 14-
year-olds in the entire country, overturning a unanimous decision of his pandemic task force to
let the age group outside in hopes of spurring more economic activity. "Just to be sure, and in
our desire to protect our people, wamilitan akong i-reimpose, June (I was forced to reimpose)
10 to 14 [year-old]," he said on Monday night, January 25, after a meeting with task force
officials in Davao City.
The President said the rule would stay until "everybody is safe by the bakung (everybody
is safe because of the vaccine)." It's fear of the new COVID-19 variant observed in the United
Kingdom that convinced Duterte to overturn his task force's move."
