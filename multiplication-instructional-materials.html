                                            INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

                            26. INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.
