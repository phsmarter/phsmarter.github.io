"Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1.

Then, choose words that tell about the place and time of the actions she did.Dear Diary, I had an exciting day. I went to school early because I had an examination in our math subject. I hoped that I answered the math problems right. During recess, I accompanied my bestfriend Leah in the canteen. We had a good time sharing our thoughts about the exam. At 10:00 a.m, we went to our science laboratory for our experiment. I really enjoyed studying mixtures. I had lunch in our classroom together with Leah and my other friends. In the afternoon, we had a roleplaying in Filipino. I played the grandmother's role. It was funny because I had to make my voice sound like that of an old woman's. My Monday was really great.

By Divina P. Maming
Dela Cruz family came together for
breakfast. Each had his/her own
story to tell about his/her
experiences for the week. This is the
usual scenario every Sunday
morning.
“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and
Maria could not wait to reach for
their chairs with a big grin on their
faces as they said, “Good morning,
nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged
his shoulders for disappointment.

“But why?” Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked
towards him and patted his shoulder. “It’s okay. You can still find another job,” she
said offering him a seat.
The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, “Tatay,

all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their
activities in school and how they fared in their subjects.
Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, “I got highest score in
Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate.” Tonio then mentioned
about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked
fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really
work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked
about what she learned from it.
Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing
lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call.
As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment
was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work
the next day again.
All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all
together. “We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual,” Mang Cardo sighed
with relief.

This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores.

We had a good time sharing our thoughts about the exam. At 10:00 a.m, we went to our science laboratory for our experiment. I really enjoyed studying mixtures. I had lunch in our classroom together with Leah and my other friends. In the afternoon, we had a roleplaying in Filipino. I played the grandmother's role.

                            9. The Glitch
By Divina P. Maming
Dela Cruz family came together for
breakfast. Each had his/her own
story to tell about his/her
experiences for the week. This is the
usual scenario every Sunday
morning.
“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and
Maria could not wait to reach for
their chairs with a big grin on their
faces as they said, “Good morning,
nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged
his shoulders for disappointment.
“Let’s eat!” mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody
seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they
saw him in a really low spirit. “What happened?” at last, the wife asked.
“I may lose my job,” he said with a croaky voice.
“But why?” Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked
towards him and patted his shoulder. “It’s okay. You can still find another job,” she
said offering him a seat.
The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, “Tatay,
don’t worry, we are here to help.”

Module 2
“Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours,” Tonio said.
“Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income,” Maria added.
Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores.
“Thank you, my dear children,” was all Aling Terie could say.
Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an
all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their
activities in school and how they fared in their subjects.
Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, “I got highest score in
Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate.” Tonio then mentioned
about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked
fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really
work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked
about what she learned from it.
Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing
lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call.
As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment
was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work
the next day again.
All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all
together. “We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual,” Mang Cardo sighed
with relief.
