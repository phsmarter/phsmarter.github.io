                        Uniforms make for one less distraction during school. By wearing what they like, children can become more focused on their school status rather than their studies. Fashion trends and owning the latest styles become the priority, and it could lead to a downturn in that child's progress at school.<br />

                         In the Philippines, wearing school uniforms and IDs are important aspects of daily life for students. Wearing a uniform provides a sense of identity and pride among students, as well as an assurance that all members of the school community can be easily identified by faculty and staff.Moreover, having standardized dress codes eliminates any sort of economic or social class distinction between peers since everyone looks alike in their uniforms. This helps to foster unity within the student body while also promoting discipline in educational settings by emphasizing focus on academic performance rather than fashion trends or material possessions.Furthermore, uniforms can provide protection against harsh weather conditions. By wearing the same type of clothing and fabrics as their peers, students are able to stay warm or cool depending on the season without having to worry about buying new clothes all the time.Lastly, wearing IDs is important for security purposes. With ID cards, school administrators can easily identify who should and shouldn't be in the premises at any given time.This helps to ensure the safety of students and staff alike as it limits access to unauthorized personnel.In conclusion, wearing school uniforms and IDs are important for many reasons. From fostering unity among students to providing protection against weather conditions and ensuring safety on campus, the advantages of having a standardized dress code far outweigh any disadvantages.<p></p><p></p>#Pa Brainliest <br />

                            27. Essay about agree or disagree to wearing a school uniform in pandemic?</h2><br />
                        Coming from someone who has worn a school uniform for most of her life, I would say that it is necessary, but only to a certain extent.<br /><br />Sure, uniforms help prevent disparities in the way students dress, inappropriate attire, and prevent poorer kids from being left out or laughed at.<br /><br />However, children (mostly teens) will always find a way to show off what they have, whether it be in the form of a LV bag or expensive stationary. Honestly, uniforms do not really help to to level the playing field, it just makes the disparity less obvious at a first glance (extremely poor kids could not even afford uniforms and theirs were often faded and too big so uniforms did not really help them at all).<br /><br />But when schools are too strict about the uniform, it can not only make school a less pleasant experience, but also hinder learning. In my old school, every thing you wore was regulated, from your shoes to the colour of your hair tie (that tiny elastic had to be dark blue or black. No exceptions). They seemed to be under the impression that my having a purple hair tie was a sign of my rebellion and that I was on the way to becoming a gangster. When the level of scrutiny reaches that level (common in Singapore), we must really ask, does this really benefit students?<br /><br />I would suggest a happy medium. A school shirt has to be worn, but students are free to wear anything they would like with it (within reason of course). This saves them some time during decision making, but they do not need to go to great lengths to adhere to ridiculous and meaningless rules.<br />
