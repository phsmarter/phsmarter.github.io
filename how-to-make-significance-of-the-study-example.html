                    <p>Lesson 1 Geologic Processes and Hazards What&#039;s In Geology is the study of the Earth and its history. It involves studying the materials that make up the earth, the features and structures found on Earth, as well as the processes that act upon them. It also deals with the study of the history of all life living on the earth now. How do geological processes occur? Geological processes are naturally occurring events that directly or indirectly impact the geology of the Earth. Examples of geological processes include events such as plate tectonics, weathering, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mountain formation, deposition, erosion, droughts, flooding, and landslides. Geological processes affect every human on the Earth all of the time, but are most noticeable when they cause loss of life or property. These threatening processes are called natural disasters. How about Geologic Hazards? A geologic hazard is an extreme natural event in the crust of the earth that poses a threat to life and property, for example, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis (tidal waves) and landslides. It is a large-scale, complex natural events that happen on land. These hazards can cause immense damage, loss of property, and sometimes life. Geologic hazards can play a significant role when infrastructure is constructed in their presence. The unpredictable nature of natural geologic hazards makes identifying, evaluating, and mitigating against them a unique challenge. .​</p>

                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

                                            The Southwest shrub Juniperus communis (Juniper Berry) has many significant medicinal value in the Native American culture that has not been proven scientifically. One of the popular uses of Juniper berries aside from its detoxifying action is its potential to repel insects. This study focuses on the development of insect repellant from its essential oil obtained through steam distillation. 50 g of fresh berries was collected and dried for 5 days and is placed in a still tank with 100 mL of water for steam distillation using the Flinn Scientific Borosilicate Lab Kit. Gather the extracted oil and dilute 70% in three separate containers to be transferred into spray bottles. Testing involved the spraying of the dilute sample into a class jar with Anopheles juidthae (common NM mosquito) and compared this to the effect of a commercial insect repellant. After testing and comparing the result, the commercial insect repellant significantly showed that it is a better insect repellant compared to the J. communis diluted essential oil. However, the essential oil has also an insect repellant potential. Activity: Analysis of the Text Directions: Answer the following questions. 1. What kind of text is this? 2.

                            1. Lesson 1 Geologic Processes and Hazards What's In Geology is the study of the Earth and its history. It involves studying the materials that make up the earth, the features and structures found on Earth, as well as the processes that act upon them. It also deals with the study of the history of all life living on the earth now. How do geological processes occur? Geological processes are naturally occurring events that directly or indirectly impact the geology of the Earth. Examples of geological processes include events such as plate tectonics, weathering, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mountain formation, deposition, erosion, droughts, flooding, and landslides. Geological processes affect every human on the Earth all of the time, but are most noticeable when they cause loss of life or property. These threatening processes are called natural disasters. How about Geologic Hazards? A geologic hazard is an extreme natural event in the crust of the earth that poses a threat to life and property, for example, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis (tidal waves) and landslides. It is a large-scale, complex natural events that happen on land. These hazards can cause immense damage, loss of property, and sometimes life. Geologic hazards can play a significant role when infrastructure is constructed in their presence. The unpredictable nature of natural geologic hazards makes identifying, evaluating, and mitigating against them a unique challenge. .​</h2><br />

                            4. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I will agree with this, considering that religion plays a significant role in human society and culture. It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years.

                            7. The Southwest shrub Juniperus communis (Juniper Berry) has many significant medicinal value in the Native American culture that has not been proven scientifically. One of the popular uses of Juniper berries aside from its detoxifying action is its potential to repel insects. This study focuses on the development of insect repellant from its essential oil obtained through steam distillation. 50 g of fresh berries was collected and dried for 5 days and is placed in a still tank with 100 mL of water for steam distillation using the Flinn Scientific Borosilicate Lab Kit. Gather the extracted oil and dilute 70% in three separate containers to be transferred into spray bottles. Testing involved the spraying of the dilute sample into a class jar with Anopheles juidthae (common NM mosquito) and compared this to the effect of a commercial insect repellant. After testing and comparing the result, the commercial insect repellant significantly showed that it is a better insect repellant compared to the J. communis diluted essential oil. However, the essential oil has also an insect repellant potential. Activity: Analysis of the Text Directions: Answer the following questions. 1. What kind of text is this? 2.
