                                            Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.

                            21. Explain and justify the purpose of martial arts in our life and how important martial arts in our culture. (ESSAY)​</h2><br />
                        Martial arts have become an important part of many people's lives, among both adults and children. Parents enroll their kids at schools to improve their focus and discipline. Many adults have made the practice of martial arts a way of life.<br /><br />Like self defense The most obvious reason why you should learn martial arts is that it teaches you how to defend yourself. It is undeniable that there is violence in the world. It occurs unexpectedly and without regard for who the victim is. Violence can affect all of us. It is important to be prepared for such occurrences, and the crux of training is to learn fighting skills. Not only do you learn specific techniques, but you also develop toughness and stamina needed to endure a physical altercation. This knowledge and conditioning lead to other benefits besides just being equipped with techniques. It also can help us have confidence Because you can handle yourself physically, you begin to develop confidence in yourself and your capabilities. You walk taller with your head up; you're prepared, calm, and self-assured. You would be surprised at the change in your mental attitude after a decent sparring session at the dojo. You learn that you can endure, that you can apply real self-defense techniques, and that you are capable and strong. theres also Making friends It's an understatement to say that you make friends in martial arts. My experience is that your teacher and fellow students are family. Your instructor is more than just a teacher; he becomes a confidant, a father, and a counselor. Your friends at the dojo are part of your social circle, helping you through thick and thin. They become good people to have in your corner; it reduce stress and many of us have tried all of them. Martial arts offers a positive way to reduce stress. You direct your energy in a physical way that is beneficial, and there is no doubt that hitting a punching bag is a great way to release pent up energy and stress.<br /><br />

                            27. Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.
