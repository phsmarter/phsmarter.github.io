                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the happiest interludes in the life of Rizal was his sojourn in the Land of the Cherry Blossoms for one month and a half (February 28 – April 13, 1888). He was enchanted by natural beauty of Japan, the charming manners of the Japanese people, and the picturesque shrines. Moreover, he fell in love with a Japanese girl, whose loveliness infused joy and romance in his sorrowing heart. Her real name was Seiko Usui. Rizal affectionately called her O-Sei-San. Fate, however, cut short his happy days in Japan. He had to sacrifice his own happiness to carry on his work for the redemption of his oppressed people. -G. Zaide and S.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>After the White Rabbit calls Alice forward, she rushes to the witness stand, forgetting she has grown. As a result, she knocks over the jurors and frantically places them back on their benches. Once settled, Alice says that she does not know anything about the Queen’s tarts. The King explains that the Queen’s tarts were very important to her before invoking Rule 42, which orders for “all persons more than a mile high to leave the court.” Upon hearing this rule, everyone turns to Alice, who denies being a mile tall. She goes on to accuse the King of making up rules, but he contradicts her, saying Rule 42 is the oldest in the book. Alice counters him, arguing that the oldest rule in the book should be Rule 1, not Rule 42.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Whenever I hear hisname, first thing that will come out to my mind is, he is the National Hero. MyRizal subject has an important role to my life because</p><p>I’ve</p><p> learned more significantinsights and information about</p><p>Rizal’s</p><p> life and the importance of his works andwritings to me and my classmates. I became more aware of his sacrificesand noble deeds and ideas.</p><p>It’s</p><p> good to know, his travels, his exile and execution,his social, political and economic ideas, the similarities of Rizal to the otherFilipino patriots.The first thing I noticed in Dr. Jose</p><p>Rizal’s</p><p> life was thathe lived a simple one. He did not choose to have a luxurious life like the mostof us have wanted. Even before he became under surveillance by the Spaniards,he had lived his life as simple as possible. I think it was the work of his parentsthat made him lived like this. I strongly believe that</p><p>one’s</p><p> lifestyle Is influencedmostly by their parents. I l earned from the life of Rizal the importance of takingpart of the parents to their</p><p>children’s</p><p> morals.I learned a lot while studying this subject.</p><p>I’ve</p><p> gainedknowledge about</p><p>Rizal’s</p><p> life and his contributions to our country.</p><p>I’ve</p><p> seen Rizal-our hero in a different perspective. While some of us may just know him as ournational hero, but for me,</p><p>I’ve</p><p>realized that</p><p>Rizal’s</p><p> just like some of</p><p>us. He’s</p><p> hadhis struggles and triumphs.His life was a truly inspiring story. Not just as an ordinarystory of a Filipino but a story of a very intelligent and talented Filipino, who isready to sacrifice his whole life just to give freedom and peace to his family, andown nation.For one semester,</p><p>I’ve</p><p>known who Rizal is. It might notall about him, but those</p><p>learning’s</p><p> and knowledge I learned, is enough to say tomyself and to other Filipino and even not, that he deserves to be what he hasknown for today. And that is, the National Hero of the Filipino. His life was trulyamazing and colorful for the</p><p>hero’s</p><p> experiences mold him to what God purposelydo to him.Jose Rizal, for my own insights, tells me the value ofcertain things which is important for the success of his life. That Is God, Family,</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In this chapter, I deeply understand the life and conditions in the Philippines during ourgreatest hero Jose Rizal's time. I was fascinated and idolized as I read the chapter because Iread a lot about his life achievements and it was unbelievable. Almost 40 accomplishmentsthat he has. So, it is undeniably true that he is considered to be the greatest hero in hisnation because of the incredible talent he has. During Rizal
</p><p>’
</p><p>s time, Filipinos felt uncertainand unhappy about many things in life. The Philippines was colonized by Spaniards for howmany years and the most powerful people were the foreigners who ruled over the Filipinos.They are 11 evils of colonial rule, but two of them attract my attention to maladministrationof justice and forced labor to Filipinos. During the maladministration of justice, court caseswere costly, unfair, and slow. Even the Spanish judges, fiscals, and other court officials weredishonest and often ignorant of the law and even the court documents were easily lost andfaked. In forced labor, all adult males from 18 t 60 years old were required to do mandatorylabor once annually and they are obliged to work for 40 to 60 days a year. Some of polistasdied on the job because annual polo was subject to many abuses and disturbed work infarms and homes. Each laborer was paid five centavos daily, the ordinary salary of twopesetas. That was the time when town of Los Ba
</p><p>ñ
</p><p>os a hospital was built by laborerssnatched from all the towns of the province. We can't deny that life before was deprivation,no equality and freedom, but the important thing Jose Rizal did for our country in order toachieve the life we have now.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            17. What is the summary of chapter 5 in the book "The American Plague"</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"The American Plague" is a book about the yellow fever epidemic that struck Memphis, Tennessee in 1878. Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have access to the contents of the book. However, I can provide a brief overview of the yellow fever epidemic that devastated Memphis in 1878.</p><p></p><p>Yellow fever is a viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes. It is a serious and often fatal disease that causes fever, muscle pain, vomiting, and jaundice. In the summer of 1878, a yellow fever epidemic swept through the city of Memphis, killing thousands of people.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the medical community knew very little about the disease and how it was spread. The city was ill-prepared to deal with the outbreak, and many people fled the city, spreading the disease to other parts of the country.</p><p></p><p>The epidemic eventually subsided when cooler temperatures arrived in the fall, but it had a profound impact on the city and its residents. The experience of the epidemic led to improvements in public health and disease prevention measures, including better sanitation, mosquito control, and the development of a yellow fever vaccine.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the yellow fever epidemic in Memphis was a tragic event, but it also played an important role in advancing our understanding of the disease and improving public health practices.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Chapter 9 of Rizal's Life, Works and Writings covers the period of time in which Rizal lived in Europe, where he continued his studies and became involved in the Propaganda Movement. This chapter highlights some of Rizal's most important achievements during this time, including the publication of his first novel, Noli Me Tangere, and his participation in the founding of the La Liga Filipina.</p><p></p><p>In terms of Rizal's personal life, Chapter 9 also covers his relationships with various women, including his courtship of and eventual marriage to Josephine Bracken. Rizal's letters and diary entries from this time provide insight into his thoughts and feelings, and show that he was still deeply concerned about the situation in the Philippines and the plight of his fellow Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Chapter 9 of Rizal's Life, Works and Writings provides a fascinating look at the period of time in which Rizal was beginning to emerge as a prominent figure in Philippine history. His intellectual achievements and political activism during this time laid the foundation for his later contributions to the Philippine independence movement.</p><br />
