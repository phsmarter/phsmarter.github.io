The most important being a great device for education. All the information one requires is just a click away. Students can educate themselves on various topics using social media. Moreover, live lectures are now possible because of social media. You can attend a lecture happening in America while sitting in India.

For instance, you can easily communicate with your friends and relatives overseas.Most importantly, it also provides a great platform for young budding artists to showcase their talent for free. You can get great opportunities for employment through social media too.Another advantage definitely benefits companies who wish to promote their brands. Social media has become a hub for advertising and offers you great opportunities for connecting with the customer.</p><p>Disadvantages of Social Media</p><p>Despite having such unique advantages, social media is considered to be one of the most harmful elements of society.
