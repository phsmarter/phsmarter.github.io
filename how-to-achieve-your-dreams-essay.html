Read the following example and answer the following questions: In today's society, the media influence everyone on how they should present themselves to the public. Thus, it also sets the standard of one's dream body. Any doctor, dietician, or nutritionist would say that the way to achieve this is just by simply eating healthier. People think that the way to eating healthier is to consume fewer fatty foods such as nuts, meat, oil and butter. Although fats contribute a lot to becoming overweight, several people do not realize that there are certain types of fat: some that are beneficial to one's well-being and some that are not. This essay will provide detailed information on the variety of fats known today, advantages and harms when consumed, and dissimilarity to other macronutrients specifically: carbohydrates and proteins (Montejo, 2013). 1.

                                            Instructions: Read the example of an argumentative essay below.  
Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                            8. Instructions: Read the example of an argumentative essay below.  
Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>How to achieve your dream house or home</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>Goal 1 – Create a positive mindset from start to finish<p>One of the key things to make your dream home a reality this year is keeping your energy and enthusiasm levels high from start to finish. Engage in completing your vision to nourish it, focus on it and protect your vision from opposing forces. Losing your motivation can affect how you commit to achieving your dream home. So make sure to be always enthusiastic and positive in claiming your dream house this year. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 2 – Start searching for the right home  <p>Either it is for starting a family or for retirement, you need to find the right property that will suit your needs. Ask yourself, is getting a two-storey house with 4 to 5 bedrooms practical when you’ll just be living alone? Or get a small bungalow or studio type house when you have a growing family with 3 to 4 kids? </p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 3 – Start saving for the down payment <p>You need to decide what amount you can comfortably afford. You can calculate the total home costs, mortgage, property taxes, and home insurance. You can start allocating a certain percentage from your income and set it aside for the initial payment. </p><p></p><p>Look for a group of passionate real estate agents to help you find the perfect home and can give you the utmost satisfaction. Remember this is your dream house and you can only deal with professional real estate experts that you can trust.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 4 – Start reserving your dream house<p>Once you found the perfect home for you and you know how much it would cost you, this is the perfect time to reserve the property. House and lot properties in Angeles City and Clark sell like pancakes. Meaning, they can be gone in an instant. That is why, when you already found the house you want to get and you have enough money for the down payment, don’t let the opportunity pass you by.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if you are renting right now, it is best to reserve the property that you want as soon as possible. This way, you can invest your money on the property that you can actually own instead of wasting it on rent. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 5 – Open a bank account solely for your dream home<p>Owning a home is really expensive. That is why you need to secure your savings. You can open a separate bank account that is solely for your dream home. Once you get your salary, transfer a portion of it to this account. Moreover, when you get extra money (bonus, raise, or extra side gig) put it here. This way you are securing enough money to fund your own home. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 6 – Start Spending Wisely <p>If you are short on money, don’t dip into your savings account that is meant for your dream house. Instead, reduce your expenses by at least 10 per cent. Or do Goal 7. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 7 – Find other sources of income<p>Owning a house and lot is a big deal and an expensive one. That is why you need to work harder to make sure you cover all the expenses needed. If you think your current salary won’t help you, better to find other sources of income to assist you in funding your dream home. It can be tough. But at the end of the day, you are paying for something that will be yours in the future. It’s just like another form of saving.</p><p></p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Just choose the important ones if you don't want write it all!</p><br />

                        I want to be a singer or a play singer.  I can achieve my dream by working hard in my education. After getting a good performance at school I can go to a good music university with the money I saved up. I will finish my university with a good grade and performance. Last I will find a job that includes singing, if I don’t get to be a famous singer that’s ok because I can still work in a musical play and I can still use my talent. That’s how I will achieve my dream. <br />
