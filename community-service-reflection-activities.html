The conception of education and of what an educated man is varies in response to fundamental changes in the details and aims of society. In our country and during this transition stage in our national life, what are the qualities which an educated man should possess? Great changes have takes place in the nature of our social life during the last forty years. The contact with the Americans and their civilization has modified many of our old customs, traditions and practices, some for the worse and many for the better. The means of communication have improved and therefore better understanding exists among the different sections of our country. Religious freedom has developed religious tolerance in our people. The growth of public schools and establishment of democratic institutions have developed our national consciousness both in strength and in solidarity. With this growth in national consciousness and national spirit among our people, we witness the corresponding rise of a new conception in education- the training of an individual for the duties and privileges of citizenship, not only for his own happiness and efficiency but also for national service and welfare. In the old days, education was a matter of private concern; now it is a public function, and the State not only has the duty but it has the right as well to educate every member of the community- the old as well as the young, women as well as non- not only for the good of the individual but also for the self-preservation and self protection of the State itself. Our modern public school system has been established as a safeguard against the shortcomings and dangers of the demoustic governinent and democratic institutions. In the light of the social changes, we come again to the question: What qualities should distinguish the educated Filipino today? I venture to suggest that the educated Filipino should, first, be distinguished by the power to DO! The Oriental excels in reflective thinking; he is a philosopher. The Occidental is a doer; he manages things, men and affairs The Filipino of today needs more of his power to translate reflection into action. I belleve that we are coming more and more to the conviction that no Filipino has the right to be considered educated unless he is prepared and ready to take un active and useful part of the work, life, and progress of our country as well as in the progress of the world."​</a>

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5.

The conception of education and of what an educated man is varies in response to fundamental changes in the details and aims of society. In our country and during this transition stage in our national life, what are the qualities which an educated man should possess? Great changes have takes place in the nature of our social life during the last forty years. The contact with the Americans and their civilization has modified many of our old customs, traditions and practices, some for the worse and many for the better. The means of communication have improved and therefore better understanding exists among the different sections of our country. Religious freedom has developed religious tolerance in our people. The growth of public schools and establishment of democratic institutions have developed our national consciousness both in strength and in solidarity. With this growth in national consciousness and national spirit among our people, we witness the corresponding rise of a new conception in education- the training of an individual for the duties and privileges of citizenship, not only for his own happiness and efficiency but also for national service and welfare. In the old days, education was a matter of private concern; now it is a public function, and the State not only has the duty but it has the right as well to educate every member of the community- the old as well as the young, women as well as non- not only for the good of the individual but also for the self-preservation and self protection of the State itself. Our modern public school system has been established as a safeguard against the shortcomings and dangers of the demoustic governinent and democratic institutions. In the light of the social changes, we come again to the question: What qualities should distinguish the educated Filipino today? I venture to suggest that the educated Filipino should, first, be distinguished by the power to DO! The Oriental excels in reflective thinking; he is a philosopher. The Occidental is a doer; he manages things, men and affairs The Filipino of today needs more of his power to translate reflection into action. I belleve that we are coming more and more to the conviction that no Filipino has the right to be considered educated unless he is prepared and ready to take un active and useful part of the work, life, and progress of our country as well as in the progress of the world."​</h2><br />

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

                            15. DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5.
