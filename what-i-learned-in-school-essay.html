                                            What I Can Do It is already the second or third month that the school has implemented the flexible learning approach. Instead of going physically to school, you continue learning your subjects at home, either through online classes or printed modules you receive every one or two weeks. The Department of Education would like to know how many students, like you, understand the current situation surrounding the flexible learning approach for this school year. The authorities requested the schools if the students can write an essay about this. You decided that it will be best to write a cause-and-effect essay discussing what leads to the using of a flexible learning approach.​</a>

                                            Instructions: Read the example of an argumentative essay below.  
Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time
Essay Topic: Learning at Home during Lockdown: My

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

Instead of going physically to school, you continue learning your subjects at home, either through online classes or printed modules you receive every one or two weeks. The Department of Education would like to know how many students, like you, understand the current situation surrounding the flexible learning approach for this school year. The authorities requested the schools if the students can write an essay about this. You decided that it will be best to write a cause-and-effect essay discussing what leads to the using of a flexible learning approach.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The current situation of using flexible learning approaches has been implemented in many schools due to various reasons. This essay aims to discuss the causes and effects of using a flexible learning approach.</p><p></p><p>One of the causes of implementing a flexible learning approach is the ongoing pandemic that has affected the world. COVID-19 has made it difficult for students to physically attend classes, leading to the implementation of a flexible learning approach. Another reason is the increasing number of students in schools. With more students, schools have to come up with ways to accommodate everyone, leading to the use of a flexible learning approach.</p><p></p><p>Another cause of using a flexible learning approach is the advancement of technology. Many schools have embraced technology in their learning process. With the help of the internet, students can access their class materials and communicate with their teachers from the comfort of their homes. Technology has made it possible for schools to provide quality education to their students through a flexible learning approach.</p><p></p><p>The effect of using a flexible learning approach is that it provides students with more freedom and flexibility in their learning process. Students can learn at their own pace and can revisit lessons that they find difficult. This approach also encourages self-discipline and responsibility since students have to take charge of their learning.</p><p></p><p>Another effect of using a flexible learning approach is that it promotes inclusivity. Students who were previously unable to attend school due to distance, health issues, or other reasons can now access quality education from wherever they are. The flexible learning approach also encourages creativity among teachers since they have to come up with innovative ways to deliver their lessons.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the implementation of a flexible learning approach has been necessitated by various factors such as the pandemic, increasing number of students, and technological advancements. The approach has various effects such as promoting inclusivity, creativity, and providing students with more flexibility in their learning process. With the continued support and improvement of the approach, students can access quality education regardless of their circumstances.</p><br />

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

Activity Directions: Read the selection and answer the questions that 
follow.
Xyza and Xyriel are twins. Their mother tells them that even when 
they look alike, they have different attitudes. Xyza is more outgoing 
and I love sports. She also convinced her mom to enroll her in a 
dancing school, for she really loves dancing. Someday, she wants to 
win an international award for being a good dancer. On the other 
hand, Xyriel prefers solitary activities more. She loves drawing and 
painting. Xyriel is always with her sketch pad, and she loves 
traveling because she finds new things to draw in every place she 
visits. They both help their mother in doing house chores. They also 
study their lessons very well. Xyza and Xyriel may have different 
hobbies and personalities, but no matter how different they are, 
they really love each other, and wish they could reach their dreams 
in the future.

                            10. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                        <p></p>Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Socialization is the process by which individuals learn and internalize the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture. These two concepts are related because socialization occurs within an ecological context, which influences the development and behavior of individuals.Socialization is the process by which individuals acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values that are necessary to function effectively in society. It is closely related to development and adaptation because socialization plays a key role in shaping an individual's personality, beliefs, and behaviors, which in turn affect their ability to adapt to different social contexts.The key assumptions of Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory are that human development is shaped by the interaction between the individual and the environment, and that this interaction occurs at multiple levels, including the microsystem (immediate environment), mesosystem (interactions between different microsystems), exosystem (external environment), and macrosystem (cultural context).The process of socialization in an ecological context involves the interaction between the individual and their immediate environment (microsystem), which includes family, peers, and other social groups. These interactions shape the individual's beliefs, values, and behaviors, and can have a significant impact on their development and adaptation.The ecological theory is useful in understanding the role of the teacher and the community in the learning of children in schools because it recognizes that development occurs within a broader ecological context. Teachers and community members play a critical role in shaping the microsystems in which children are socialized, and can have a significant impact on their academic achievement and social-emotional development. By understanding the ecological factors that influence learning, educators can design more effective interventions and support systems for children.<br />

                            14. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses. ACTIVITY 2 Directions. From the essay #2, complete this organizer with persuasive points for each of the paragraphs following the thesis statement below. Write your answer in your notebook following the format below. Thesis statement: I will show you the two best reasons why education is important in our society hi po pahelp po please needed napo​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Why is Education Important in Our Society:<p>One of the benefits of education is that the educational system teaches us how to obtain and develop critical and logical thinking and make independent decisions. When children become adults, they are faced with a lot of challenging issues – pay off your student loans, get a job, buy a car and a house, provide for your family, etc. However, if one has spent years educating themselves, they should be able to make sound decisions on these various quandaries. Not only are people able to form their own opinions, but they are also good at finding solid and reliable arguments and evidence to back up and confirm their decisions. !!</p><br />

                            17. Learning Task 3Read the argumentative essay that follows. Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

                            19. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                            21. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />
