                                            The Legend of Maria Makiling (Excerpt)Once upon a time, a diwata lived in a mountain of Laguna. She was called Maria Makiling. She was very beautiful. Maria was always about helping other people. One time, the children of a farmer got sick. When he went to Maria to seek help, he was given a bilao full of ginger.The farmer sadly went home carrying the bilao of ginger. When he reached his hut, he was greatly surprised: the ginger had turned to gold! Because of Maria's kindness, the townsfolk had grown to love her.Maria was a great beauty. She had many suitors who were rich and powerful such as Captain Lara and the rich adventurer Joselito and many others. Secretly, Maria Makiling favored a poor farmer named Juan among all her suitors because of his simplicity and humility. As time passed, her suitors became more and more impatient and demanded that Maria tell them who she loves so the diwata was forced to promise: "By the night of the full moon. I will tell you my answer."When the night of the full moon arrived, all of her suitors climbed up the mountain to know her decision. They were all disappointed when Maria told them that it was Juan whom she loved. The suitors went away very angry with Juan. Captain Lara and Joselito thought of a plan against him. One day, all was surprised when a huge fire burned a wooden building guarded by Captain Lara. With the help of Joselito, they blamed the fire to Juan who was tortured in the prison. On his dying moments, Juan was still calling the name of Maria Makiling. It was heard by the diwata so she quickly went down her mountain. But Juan was already dead whenMaria arrived and all Maria could do was to cry endlessly beside Juan's dead body. The next day. Maria Makilingwas gone and was never seen again by the people.character:setings:plot:theme:point of view:​</a>

 Stone Soup
A kindly, old stranger was walking through the land when he came upon a village. As he entered, the villagers moved towards their homes locking doors and windows.
The stranger smiled and asked, why are you all so frightened. I am a simple traveler, looking for a soft place to stay for the night and a warm place for a meal.
"There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "We are weak and our children are starving. Better keep moving on."
"Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of making some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron cauldron from his cloak, filled it with water, and began to build a fire under it.
Then, with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a silken bag and dropped it into the water.
By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come out of their homes or watched from their windows. As the stranger sniffed the "broth" and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their fear.
"Ahh," the stranger said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty stone soup. Of course, stone soup with cabbage -- that's hard to beat."
Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a small cabbage he'd retrieved from its hiding place, and added it to the pot.
"Wonderful!!" cried the stranger. "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of salt beef as well, and it was fit for a king."
The village butcher managed to find some salt beef . . . And so it went, through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was indeed a delicious meal for everyone in the village to share.
The villager elder offered the stranger a great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell it and traveled on the next day.
As he left, the stranger came upon a group of village children standing near the road. He gave the silken bag containing the stone to the youngest child, whispering to a group, "It was not the stone, but the villagers that had performed the magic."

                            19. The Legend of Maria Makiling (Excerpt)Once upon a time, a diwata lived in a mountain of Laguna. She was called Maria Makiling. She was very beautiful. Maria was always about helping other people. One time, the children of a farmer got sick. When he went to Maria to seek help, he was given a bilao full of ginger.The farmer sadly went home carrying the bilao of ginger. When he reached his hut, he was greatly surprised: the ginger had turned to gold! Because of Maria's kindness, the townsfolk had grown to love her.Maria was a great beauty. She had many suitors who were rich and powerful such as Captain Lara and the rich adventurer Joselito and many others. Secretly, Maria Makiling favored a poor farmer named Juan among all her suitors because of his simplicity and humility. As time passed, her suitors became more and more impatient and demanded that Maria tell them who she loves so the diwata was forced to promise: "By the night of the full moon. I will tell you my answer."When the night of the full moon arrived, all of her suitors climbed up the mountain to know her decision. They were all disappointed when Maria told them that it was Juan whom she loved. The suitors went away very angry with Juan. Captain Lara and Joselito thought of a plan against him. One day, all was surprised when a huge fire burned a wooden building guarded by Captain Lara. With the help of Joselito, they blamed the fire to Juan who was tortured in the prison. On his dying moments, Juan was still calling the name of Maria Makiling. It was heard by the diwata so she quickly went down her mountain. But Juan was already dead whenMaria arrived and all Maria could do was to cry endlessly beside Juan's dead body. The next day. Maria Makilingwas gone and was never seen again by the people.character:setings:plot:theme:point of view:​</h2><br />

 Stone Soup
A kindly, old stranger was walking through the land when he came upon a village. As he entered, the villagers moved towards their homes locking doors and windows.
The stranger smiled and asked, why are you all so frightened. I am a simple traveler, looking for a soft place to stay for the night and a warm place for a meal.
"There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "We are weak and our children are starving. Better keep moving on."
"Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of making some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron cauldron from his cloak, filled it with water, and began to build a fire under it.
Then, with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a silken bag and dropped it into the water.
By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come out of their homes or watched from their windows. As the stranger sniffed the "broth" and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their fear.
"Ahh," the stranger said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty stone soup. Of course, stone soup with cabbage -- that's hard to beat."
Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a small cabbage he'd retrieved from its hiding place, and added it to the pot.
"Wonderful!!" cried the stranger. "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of salt beef as well, and it was fit for a king."
The village butcher managed to find some salt beef . . . And so it went, through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was indeed a delicious meal for everyone in the village to share.
The villager elder offered the stranger a great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell it and traveled on the next day.
As he left, the stranger came upon a group of village children standing near the road. He gave the silken bag containing the stone to the youngest child, whispering to a group, "It was not the stone, but the villagers that had performed the magic." 
Give the elements of these i mean the answer of the elements:
-Settings
-Characters
-summary of the story
-Conflict
-Climax
-Resolution
-Theme
 -Moral lesson
