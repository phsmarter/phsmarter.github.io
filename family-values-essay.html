                                            Direction: Read the essay below. Choose the statements that show opinions. Write them on a separate answer sheet.
Fact or Bluff
 Nowadays, many Filipinos are confused about every statement that they hear or read in any news platforms. Agreements or disagreements are popping in in social media. Whether these statements are truth or opinion becomes a subject matter for everyone. Thus, the question is: “Is it a fact or a bluff?”
 I think no one values honesty. “BMD denies withholding funds”, “No Filipino is affected by pandemic in the US”, “Bitoy passes away”, “Palacio Filipino unaware of China’s firm”, “No Filipino believes worst of COVID-19 pandemic yet to come”…. These were just a few of headlines that we read on the newspaper and watch over the television, or even read on the online sites. In my opinion, these statements are more of a kind of a bluff than a fact. Moreover, if these are facts then we should have found proofs to verify these statements. Some are manipulating everything to hide the truth. Is it a fact or a bluff?
 I believe that Filipinos deserve to be informed of the truth. For instance, 57% based on the SWS survey of Filipinos believe worst of the pandemic yet to come. How can we enjoy the holiday seasons amidst this prediction? I think no Filipino family can have a merry Christmas this year. All of us will have “tawilis” on our table. Is it a fact or a bluff?

Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

                            9. Direction: Read the essay below. Choose the statements that show opinions. Write them on a separate answer sheet.
Fact or Bluff
 Nowadays, many Filipinos are confused about every statement that they hear or read in any news platforms. Agreements or disagreements are popping in in social media. Whether these statements are truth or opinion becomes a subject matter for everyone. Thus, the question is: “Is it a fact or a bluff?”
 I think no one values honesty. “BMD denies withholding funds”, “No Filipino is affected by pandemic in the US”, “Bitoy passes away”, “Palacio Filipino unaware of China’s firm”, “No Filipino believes worst of COVID-19 pandemic yet to come”…. These were just a few of headlines that we read on the newspaper and watch over the television, or even read on the online sites. In my opinion, these statements are more of a kind of a bluff than a fact. Moreover, if these are facts then we should have found proofs to verify these statements. Some are manipulating everything to hide the truth. Is it a fact or a bluff?
 I believe that Filipinos deserve to be informed of the truth. For instance, 57% based on the SWS survey of Filipinos believe worst of the pandemic yet to come. How can we enjoy the holiday seasons amidst this prediction? I think no Filipino family can have a merry Christmas this year. All of us will have “tawilis” on our table. Is it a fact or a bluff?
Activity 1: Share your Thoughts. Discuss your answer with an adult in your family and try to exchange ideas on this activity.
1.Were you able to identify opinionated statements and true statements?
2.What was your basis in identifying them?
Was it easy or difficult?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Opinions found :</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>-I think no one values honesty.  </p><p>-In my opinion, these statements are more of a kind of a bluff than a fact.
</p><p>-I believe that Filipinos deserve to be informed of the truth.  </p><p>-I think no Filipino family can have a merry Christmas this year. All of us will have “tawilis” on our table.
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Yes I was able to differentiate facts and opinions.
</p><p>2. It was easy because there are clue words such as "I think", "I believe", and "In my opinion".</p><br />

Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

What is your ideal future marriage?
Compare your family now to your ideal marriage.
What are you going to do to have your ideal marriage?
What help do you need from the people around you?
How do you value people being part of your success?</h2><br />
                        <p>As a young talented woman, my ideal future marriage would be one where my partner and I are equal partners, where we respect and support each other's goals and aspirations, and where we communicate openly and honestly with each other. It would be a partnership built on trust, love, and mutual understanding, where we are able to grow and evolve together.</p><p></p><p>When I compare my family now to my ideal marriage, I see areas where we can improve. While my family is supportive and loving, there are times when communication could be better, and we could work on being more understanding of each other's perspectives. In my ideal marriage, I would like to have a deeper level of communication and understanding with my partner, where we are able to express ourselves freely and without judgment.</p><p></p><p>To have my ideal marriage, I need to work on myself first. This means being self-aware, understanding my own needs and desires, and being open to growth and change. I also need to be willing to put in the effort to build a strong and healthy relationship with my partner, which includes being patient, understanding, and supportive of each other's growth.</p><p></p><p>The people around me can help me achieve my ideal marriage by being supportive and understanding. This includes my family, friends, and loved ones who can offer advice, guidance, and a listening ear when I need it. I also value having a community of like-minded individuals who share my values and beliefs, and who can help me grow and evolve as a person.</p><p></p><p>For me, people being part of my success is very important. I believe that we are all interconnected, and that we all have something to offer each other. Whether it's through emotional support, guidance, or simply being a sounding board, having people around me who support and believe in me is essential to my success. I also believe that success is not just about achieving goals, but about having a positive impact on the world around us, and I value having people around me who share this perspective.</p><p>Oh geez, I don't know if I'm the best person to answer this. I mean, I'm only a teenager, and marriage seems like a pretty big deal. But, uh, I guess if I had to think about it, my ideal future marriage would be with someone who I love and who loves me back, ya know? Like, we'd be best friends, and we'd have each other's backs no matter what. And, um, we'd have fun together, and we'd be able to talk about anything, even the tough stuff. Oh, and I guess it would be cool if we had some common interests, too.</p><p></p><p>As for comparing my family now to my ideal marriage, well, I don't really want to do that. I mean, my parents love each other and all, but they also fight a lot, and sometimes it seems like they don't even like each other very much. I don't want that for my own marriage, ya know?</p><p></p><p>To have my ideal marriage, I guess I'll have to find the right person first. And then, um, we'll have to work on our communication and stuff. Like, we'll have to learn how to listen to each other and respect each other's feelings. And, uh, we'll have to be willing to compromise, too.</p><p></p><p>As for help from the people around me, I think I'll need support from my family and friends. Like, they can help me figure out if someone is a good match for me, and they can be there for me when things get tough. And, um, I guess it would be nice if they could give me advice or something if I ever need it.</p><p></p><p>I think people being part of my success is super important. Like, I wouldn't be where I am today without the people who have helped me and supported me along the way. And, uh, I don't think I'll be able to have a successful marriage without the help of the people around me, either. So, yeah, I definitely value people being part of my success.</p><br />

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."
