                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The specific factors of culture that can affect selling activities include:</p><p></p><p>a. Language: Language is a significant factor in cross-cultural selling activities. The use of the right language can help to build trust and rapport with potential customers. However, language differences can also create misunderstandings and barriers to effective communication.</p><p></p><p>b. Customs and traditions: Each culture has its own customs and traditions that can affect the way selling activities are conducted. For example, some cultures may prefer face-to-face meetings, while others may prefer more indirect forms of communication.</p><p></p><p>c. Social norms: Social norms can also influence selling activities. For example, some cultures may value individualism, while others may value collectivism. This can affect the way salespeople approach potential customers and the types of products and services that are advertised.</p><p></p><p>d. Religion: Religion can also play a role in selling activities. Certain products or services may be considered taboo in certain cultures, and salespeople must be aware of these cultural sensitivities.</p><p></p><p>e. Values and beliefs: Finally, values and beliefs can also affect selling activities. For example, some cultures may place a high value on price and value, while others may prioritize quality and brand reputation.</p><p></p><p>2. The 13 questions in the personal selling process and problem identification are:</p><p></p><p>a. What are the customer's needs? - This question helps to identify the specific needs of the customer.</p><p></p><p>b. What are the customer's problems or challenges? - This question helps to identify the challenges that the customer is facing.</p><p></p><p>c. How does the customer make buying decisions? - This question helps to understand the decision-making process of the customer.</p><p></p><p>d. Who are the key decision-makers? - This question helps to identify the individuals who have the authority to make a buying decision.</p><p></p><p>e. What is the customer's budget? - This question helps to understand the financial constraints of the customer.</p><p></p><p>f. What are the customer's expectations? - This question helps to understand the customer's expectations of the product or service.</p><p></p><p>g. What are the customer's preferences? - This question helps to understand the customer's preferences in terms of product features and benefits.</p><p></p><p>h. What is the customer's buying history? - This question helps to understand the customer's past buying behavior.</p><p></p><p>i. What is the competition offering? - This question helps to understand the competitive landscape and how the product or service compares.</p><p></p><p>j. What is the customer's perception of the company's brand? - This question helps to understand how the customer perceives the company's brand.</p><p></p><p>k. What is the customer's perception of the salesperson? - This question helps to understand how the customer perceives the salesperson.</p><p></p><p>l. What are the customer's objections? - This question helps to understand the customer's concerns or objections to the product or service.</p><p></p><p>m. What are the potential barriers to closing the sale? - This question helps to identify any potential obstacles that may prevent the sale from closing.</p><p></p><p>In terms of what is good to give for each specific question, it really depends on the individual situation and the needs of the customer. However, in general, good information to give would be anything that helps to answer the specific question and address the customer's needs or concerns. This could include product specifications, testimonials from satisfied customers, or case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of the product or service.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
