A researcher conducted a study in Poonbato Integrated School. With a total of 4,876, he cannot use all students as his participants due to lack of resources. His topic is about the evaluation of the school head's Sagip Kalinga Program, a program focusing on indigenous peoples (IP) parents. Since the school is 100% IP school, any parent who has a child enrolled in that school is a potential respondent. Questions 1. Which type of research design is the most appropriate in this case? Read the topic of the research that was mentioned. 2. Which sampling technique must be used? Remember that all parents who has a child enrolled in that school are potential respondents. 3. What is the sample size using Slovin's formula given a margin of error of 5%? You may go back to the discussion part and see a sample computation.​</a>

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</a>

                                            For learners to acquire language, meaningful communicative opportunities fornegotiation and interaction are needed (Beckett, 1999; Swain, 1995; Kern&amp; Warschauer, 2000). Likewise, the integration of instructional materials (IMs)augments the stimulation of ideas for classroom activities (Cunnigsworth, 1995;Dudley-Evans &amp; St.John, 1998). Hence, this paper aimed to reboot the ESLClassroom via technology-based instructional materials (TBIMs). Specifically, itsought answers to the following objectives: (1) identify the TBIMs in ESL classrooms;(2) determine the problems encountered on TBIMs; (3) present the implications ofTBIMs; and (4) propose augmentation on TBIMs. The descriptive type of research andthe stratified random sampling technique were employed. Respondents were drawnfrom the senior high school students of Grade 11 enrolled in English for Academicand Professional Purposes (EAPP) during first semester of school year 2017-2018,and five (5) English Language Teachers at San Francisco B National High School,Lopez, Quezon. The collection of data was accomplished through: (1) administrationof a modified questionnaire on TBIMs and (2) conduct of a follow-up interview on theencountered problems and implications of TBIMs. The findings revealed thatrespondents have an unenthusiastic perception on the feasibility/effectiveness ofTBIMs to supplement the teaching and learning of the language. Nevertheless, thefindings showed more affirmative viewpoints that TBIMs had somehow increasedtheir level of interest in English and boot up the ESL classroom as well. Even thoughTBIMs remained insufficient and usually unavailable, the researcher still consideredthe returns of being equipped with knowledge and gadgets. But still, in order toemploy TBIMs in supplementing the English language teaching and learning,auxiliary and in-depth discussions and scrutiny about the applicability of TBIMshave to be made. A very short course or workshop (technology-based teaching andlearning camp) is suggested to ESL teachers in order to help them increaseknowledge in TBIMs and to create a link between the virtual world and the real worldamong the students.1.what issue or concept is presented in the text​</a>

- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />

In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</h2><br />

                            18. For learners to acquire language, meaningful communicative opportunities fornegotiation and interaction are needed (Beckett, 1999; Swain, 1995; Kern&amp; Warschauer, 2000). Likewise, the integration of instructional materials (IMs)augments the stimulation of ideas for classroom activities (Cunnigsworth, 1995;Dudley-Evans &amp; St.John, 1998). Hence, this paper aimed to reboot the ESLClassroom via technology-based instructional materials (TBIMs). Specifically, itsought answers to the following objectives: (1) identify the TBIMs in ESL classrooms;(2) determine the problems encountered on TBIMs; (3) present the implications ofTBIMs; and (4) propose augmentation on TBIMs. The descriptive type of research andthe stratified random sampling technique were employed. Respondents were drawnfrom the senior high school students of Grade 11 enrolled in English for Academicand Professional Purposes (EAPP) during first semester of school year 2017-2018,and five (5) English Language Teachers at San Francisco B National High School,Lopez, Quezon. The collection of data was accomplished through: (1) administrationof a modified questionnaire on TBIMs and (2) conduct of a follow-up interview on theencountered problems and implications of TBIMs. The findings revealed thatrespondents have an unenthusiastic perception on the feasibility/effectiveness ofTBIMs to supplement the teaching and learning of the language. Nevertheless, thefindings showed more affirmative viewpoints that TBIMs had somehow increasedtheir level of interest in English and boot up the ESL classroom as well. Even thoughTBIMs remained insufficient and usually unavailable, the researcher still consideredthe returns of being equipped with knowledge and gadgets. But still, in order toemploy TBIMs in supplementing the English language teaching and learning,auxiliary and in-depth discussions and scrutiny about the applicability of TBIMshave to be made. A very short course or workshop (technology-based teaching andlearning camp) is suggested to ESL teachers in order to help them increaseknowledge in TBIMs and to create a link between the virtual world and the real worldamong the students.1.what issue or concept is presented in the text​</h2><br />

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />

Pinapayagan ng mga survey na ito ang isang paggalugad ng mga salik na nauugnay sa ganitong uri ng pandaraya at isang paghahambing sa pagitan ng tinutukoy namin bilang E-cheating at tradisyunal na mga paraan ng pandaraya. Ipinapahiwatig ng mga resulta na humigit-kumulang na 40% ng mga mag-aaral ang nakatuon sa ilang anyo ng E-cheating sa nakaraang taon. Ang mga variable ng pagkatuto sa lipunan ay lumalabas bilang pinakamalakas na tagahula ng parehong paglitaw at dalas ng E-cheating habang ang mga variable ng pagpipigil sa sarili at pilay ay may maliit na epekto.</p><br />
