                                            Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center. If you follow the three Rs - reduce, reuse, and recycle,you can help save the world's forests. varagraph.

is surrounded by large body of water and this is the reason why it is always
visited by typhoons. Just recently, Typhoon ULYSSES hit our country which
affected the lives of many Filipinos. Damages in crops, properties, and loss of
lives are just some of its effects to the community. Awareness and preparedness
in case of calamities can help save lives.

                            4. Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center.
