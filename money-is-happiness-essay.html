To organize your synthesis/essay, fill in the template below and follow the rubric given for your guidance and reference. "When we give to others it activates the areas of the brain associated with pleasure, social connection and trust. Altruistic behavior releases endorphins in the brain and boosts happiness for us as well as the people we help. Studies have shown that giving money away tends to make people happier than spending it on themselves."

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Money is often seen as a path to happiness, but is this really the case? While it is true that money can provide individuals with access to certain luxuries and opportunities, it is not a guarantee for happiness. In fact, many individuals who possess great wealth still struggle with mental health issues and feelings of unhappiness. Therefore, the idea that money can buy happiness is a flawed one.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, money can provide individuals with access to material possessions, which can provide temporary satisfaction. However, studies have shown that material possessions do not lead to long-term happiness. The initial excitement and pleasure of purchasing something new wears off quickly, leaving individuals feeling unfulfilled and searching for the next thing to buy. Additionally, the constant pursuit of material possessions can lead to a never-ending cycle of wanting more, which can actually lead to feelings of stress and unhappiness.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, money can provide individuals with experiences that can bring happiness, such as traveling or attending events. However, it is important to note that experiences are only enjoyable if they are shared with loved ones. No matter how much money one has, if they are unable to share experiences with those they care about, they may still feel lonely and unfulfilled.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals cwho prioritize money over relationships and experiences are less happy than those who prioritize social connections and personal growth. This is because social connections and personal growth provide individuals with a sense of purpose and fulfillment that cannot be achieved through material possessions or money.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the idea that money can buy happiness is a flawed one. While money can provide individuals with temporary satisfaction and access to certain experiences, it is not a guarantee for long-term happiness. Instead, individuals should prioritize social connections and personal growth, which can provide them with a sense of purpose and fulfillment that cannot be achieved through money alone.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I won't exactly make an essay but I do believe that money can't literally buy happiness, it can only buy you things that make you happy. Whether it's being able to afford to buy or do things that give you happiness or not worrying about your next meal, your education, healthcare, or bills. You can also support your essay by stating studies and statistics that show that well-off (or wealthy) people are generally happier than those who struggle with their finances. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

"When we give to others it activates the areas of the brain associated with pleasure, social connection and trust. Altruistic behavior releases endorphins in the brain and boosts happiness for us as well as the people we help. Studies have shown that giving money away tends to make people happier than spending it on themselves."

                            19. money is human happiness in the abstract, and so the man who is no longer capable of enjoying such happiness in the concrete, sets his whole heart on money (essay)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What does that mean?
The longer version of the quote (included at the bottom of the post) goes on to state that once one can no longer be happy, in concrete form, the person will focus solely on money.
Happiness comes to humans in many forms. A pleasant day, a warm smile from a friend, or the scent of your favorite food hanging in the air.
Money can buy one of those three examples. But when you no longer care about the weather, have alienated all your friends, and can no longer truly enjoy food, art or music, to what do you turn?
Money is the abstract form of happiness, in that when you have enough money, you can buy many things to make you happy. But focusing on the money, and not the happiness all around us, can be problematic.
</p><p>
Why is concrete happiness important?
While it is true that money cannot buy true happiness, it can be useful for getting a moment of it here and there, from time to time. In this manner, money is actually an abstract of it, something which can be exchanged for a form of it on a short-term basis. But that form is only temporary.
</p><p>
The more concrete types of happiness are much longer lasting and more satisfying. Relationships with other people is one of the deeper and longest lasting of the ways we can find it in our lives. Others include an appreciation of various art forms, from sculpture and painting to music and singing.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As an opening,I would likely present you things that money can buy happiness.</p><p>Yes,money can buy happiness.We are not in the place where you can get what you want buy pleasing and to actually have it easily.Things are paid and people needs hard work to be paid.Money is the only thing that people have in order to get something that they want.People asks for jobs to have money so they can achieve something they want,which is their source of happiness.Maybe not all people find happiness through money,but almost all finds money to buy their happiness.Mostly people will say that "what you experience after having something that makes you happy is what makes you happy",I agree but before you can have that something that makes you happy,you actually buy it <strong>with </strong>money. Affection and Love makes you happy without money but things you want to sentiment starts from buying it with money.</p><p></p><br />

                            22. May you translate the following sentences for my filipino essay? (Google Translate Doesn't work) I had a good time in my field trip. I went to 3 different places. The first place I went was "Sweet Field trip" It was nice staying there, we saw many different plants which was really interesting and we got to make a cupcake as well! The second place was really interesting and it's called "Art in island" It was a blast of fun there. Many cool illusions to play with and we got to watch a show and eat food. The last destination was "Bagumbayan Light and sound museum". It was a little boring and fun but there was a lot of these products called "Slime balls". I bought one because I had extra money. After that I arrived back home at around 7:10pm to 7:30pm I was really happy about this field trip because it was a blast.</h2><br />
                        try ko lang.<br /><br />nag-enjoy ako sa field trip namin. nagpunta ako sa tatlong (3) ibat-ibang lugar. Yung unang pinuntahan ko ay tinatawag na "Sweet Field Trip" at magandang tumuloy dun, nakakita kami ng marami't iba't-ibang halaman na kawili-wili at may tsansa pa kaming gumawa ng cupcake! Yung pangalawang lugar naman ay tunay na kawili-wili at ito'y tinatawag na "Art in Island" ang saya dun. madaming astig na ilusyon na mapaglalaruan at nakapanood kami ng palabas at kumain din kami. At ang huli namin pinuntahan ay ang "Bagumbayan Light and sound museum". Medyo nakakabagot at masaya doon, maraming produkto sa lugar na yon katulad ng "Slime ball". Bumili ako kasi may sobra sa pera ko. Pagkatapos nun nakauwi ako ng mga alas siyete diyes(7:10) o alas siyete trenta (7:30) ng gabi, tunay akong masaya dito sa field trip namin dahil ito ay.. grabe!<br />

                        <p>Can Money Buy Happiness Essay
</p><p>Can money buy happiness? Why or why not?
</p><p>
</p><p>It is tough to say whether or not money can buy happiness because happiness is difficult, if not impossible, to define. Some would say that money can provide you with basic comforts (shelter, food, healthcare) that are a prerequisite for experiencing happiness. On the other hand, happiness is a complex emotion that is influenced by intangible factors such as one’s personality. Though possessing a certain amount of wealth may make it more statistically likely that one will lead a happy life, it is by no means the sole determinant of happiness.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Covid-19 Pandemic</p><p></p><p>It is caused by a coronavirus that caused a large amount of destruction. More and more cases are being reported daily with different variants.</p><p></p><p>Here is the Speech for the Covid-19 issue in terms of education:</p><p></p><p>As a person who is hoping for a better future and to make the country out of the current situation, I wish everyone good health no matter what kind of social status we are in. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is (INSERT YOUR NAME HERE) currently in (INSERT YOUR GRADE LEVEL HERE). I am also an ordinary individual who wants nothing but a better lifestyle for everyone in the next few days.</p><p></p><p>In the year 2010, face masks and face shields were not introduced. We only go outside just to enjoy life and do the usual things we are fond of doing. No community quarantines and distance between two or more individuals are not observed. We only want what makes everyone happy.  We do not have all the strict compliance and rules every time we go outside.  But we are in a different situation now.</p><p></p><p>From 2019 until now, one of the main questions students ask is “How long will this online class take?”</p><p></p><p>This has been one of the most important questions that students nowadays are asking. Public parks are now open where kids and adults can go. Churches are also serving the public and welcome visitors of any age. Public malls, which accommodate thousands of shoppers and guests every day, are also open. Why are schools still not ready to accept students?</p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has surprisingly changed the way people live and work. Aside from these, students are also adjusting to the new normal style of teaching just to be globally competitive when it comes to providing quality education. It has also caused a dramatic disruption in the delivery of education. The closures of schools and limited techniques to teach students to challenge our country’s literacy rate.</p><p></p><p>During the pandemic, new teaching styles and blended learning which are combinations of two or more methods have been introduced. The pandemic’s negative effect on the educational system is evident as the World Bank reports that Philippine education is disturbing for the year 2021. July 2021, the Malacañang palace expressed alarm over the World Bank report that over 80% of Filipino students fall below the minimum proficiency levels.</p><p></p><p>With the educational crisis our nation is facing, what are the other long-term negative effects will it bring? Will we still deal with the blended learning style or should we shift again to the face-to-face method?</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>You're Welcome&lt;//3</p><br />

                        ANSWER:<p>Introduction:</p><p>Money is often considered to be a key factor in achieving happiness in life. However, many people argue that money is not the only factor that contributes to happiness. This essay will argue that money does not give happiness in life. While having sufficient financial resources can provide a certain level of comfort and security, it does not necessarily guarantee happiness.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Argument 1: Money can lead to materialism, which is not sustainable in the long run.</p><p>Supporting Evidence:</p><p></p><p>•Materialism is the excessive focus on material possessions and wealth as a means of achieving happiness.</p><p></p><p>•Studies have shown that materialism is associated with lower levels of life satisfaction and well-being.</p><p></p><p>Counterargument: Some may argue that having more money can lead to greater opportunities and experiences, which can increase happiness.</p><p></p><p>Rebuttal: While it is true that having more money can provide greater opportunities, it is important to note that these opportunities are not always sustainable. Moreover, pursuing materialistic goals can lead to a cycle of desire and dissatisfaction, ultimately resulting in unhappiness.</p><p></p><p>Argument 2: Money cannot buy social and emotional support.</p><p>Supporting Evidence:</p><p></p><p>•Social connections and emotional support are key factors in achieving happiness and well-being.</p><p></p><p>•Studies have shown that people with strong social connections and support networks tend to be happier and more satisfied with their lives.</p><p></p><p>Counterargument: Some may argue that having money can lead to more opportunities to build social connections and support networks.</p><p></p><p>Rebuttal: While it is true that having money can provide opportunities for building social connections, it is important to note that genuine social connections and emotional support cannot be bought. People who rely solely on their wealth to build relationships may find themselves surrounded by people who are only interested in their money, leading to a lack of genuine emotional support.</p><p></p><p>Argument 3: Money can lead to increased stress and anxiety.</p><p>Supporting Evidence:</p><p></p><p>•Studies have shown that people with high levels of debt and financial insecurity tend to experience higher levels of stress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>•The pursuit of wealth can also lead to a work-life imbalance, resulting in increased stress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Counterargument: Some may argue that having more money can lead to greater financial security, which can reduce stress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Rebuttal: While it is true that having more money can provide greater financial security, it is important to note that financial security alone does not guarantee happiness. Moreover, the pursuit of wealth can lead to a work-life imbalance, which can ultimately result in increased stress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, while money can provide a certain level of comfort and security, it is not the only factor that contributes to happiness. Pursuing materialistic goals and relying solely on wealth to build social connections and emotional support can ultimately lead to unhappiness. Moreover, the pursuit of wealth can lead to increased stress and anxiety. Therefore, it is important to recognize that there are many factors that contribute to happiness, and money is just one of them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
