Although Philippine literature at the turn of the 21st century is considered to have a brief history; however, most of its writers have already left significant marks in the minds and hearts of its readers through their writings. According to Uychoco (2016), Jose Rizal's undying Noli Me Tangere, casts a long shadow on Philippine literature, today's literary scene is quite different from what it was in the past. English as Second Language teachers still introduce this masterpiece to today's learners as it has emerged not only flexible but innovative literature that has been appreciated and used in various literary learning and even educational debates about language. Literary appreciation is a way of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas about the texts read. It is not just about reading and appreciating them, it is also about understanding their contexts. Through this, both teachers and learners will have a better and wider mental grasp of what they read. It is how we interpret what we read that help us gain a general knowledge of our history and strengthen even our very own personal reflection on our present situation. Philippine literature helps our Filipino learners catch a glimpse of our culture and heritage: that is to say, whatever literary genre we read moves us, triggers our wild imagination, provokes our sense of curiosity, and stirs our thoughts and feelings, upon our own common experience of our present situations.

For centuries, Philippines has become popular for its prolific writers when it comes to literary undertakings. Although Philippine literature at the turn of the 21st century is considered to have a brief history; however, most of its writers have already left significant marks in the minds and hearts of its readers through their writings. According to Uychoco (2016), Jose Rizal's undying Noli Me Tangere, casts a long shadow on Philippine literature, today's literary scene is quite different from what it was in the past. English as Second Language teachers still introduce this masterpiece to today's learners as it has emerged not only flexible but innovative literature that has been appreciated and used in various literary learning and even educational debates about language. Literary appreciation is a way of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas about the texts read. It is not just about reading and appreciating them, it is also about understanding their contexts. Through this, both teachers and learners will have a better and wider mental grasp of what they read. It is how we interpret what we read that help us gain a general knowledge of our history and strengthen even our very own personal reflection on our present situation. Philippine literature helps our Filipino learners catch a glimpse of our culture and heritage: that is to say, whatever literary genre we read moves us, triggers our wild imagination, provokes our sense of curiosity, and stirs our thoughts and feelings, upon our own common experience of our present situations.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Theology can be a daunting subject. When it comes to topics like the Doctrine of Christ, people can sink into their seats and ignore the subject, which is a terrible response to such precious biblical truth. Within the Doctrine of Christ, most theologians cover two distinct sections, the person of Christ and the work of Christ. Both of these are of utmost importance for biblical Christianity, but for this particular article, the work of Christ will be highlighted. Specifically, the “three offices” of Christ and His execution of those offices will be our primary targets. </p><p></p><br />
