                        Biographical Essay<br /><br />￼<br /><br />I grew up in the Boston area in the 1970s. My mother was a pre-school teacher and my father a playwright. I remember visiting my mother's classroom and reading to the children there; even more vividly, I remember sitting in the back row of theater after theater, watching rehearsals – seeing stories come to life.<br /><br />My mother read me countless picture books, but at my father's house there wasn't much of that nature. He read me what was at hand: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Huckleberry Finn, Sherlock Holmes. He also made up stories for me and recounted the plots of Shakespeare plays.<br /><br />I was a raw child. In fact, I am a raw adult. This is a hard quality to live with sometimes, but it is a useful quality if you want to be a writer. It is easy to hurt my feelings, and I am unable to watch the news or read about painful subjects without weeping. I was often called over-sensitive when I was young, but I've learned to appreciate this quality in myself, and to use it in my writing.<br /><br />Growing up, I spent large parts of my life in imaginary worlds: Neverland, Oz, and Narnia, in particular. I read in the bath, at meals, in the car, you name it. Around the age of eight, I began working on my own writing. My early enterprises began with a seminal picture book featuring an heroic orange sleeping bag, followed by novel-length imitations of The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken and Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren.<br /><br />I have never kept journals or notebooks for my own sake. I am a writer who writes always with the idea of an audience in mind -- and at nine I was determined to share my Pippi story with the world. I got my father to type it up in a book format and photocopy it 50 times. Then he took me to an artist friend's studio where we silkscreened 50 copies of a drawing I'd made for the cover. I gave it to everyone I knew. That was my first book.<br /><br />I have always been interested in picture books as a form, which stems (I suppose) from my background in theater. I am fascinated by the intersection of words and images – the way meanings of words can be altered by changing their presentation. An actor varies her intonation, or an illustrator changes a line – and the story is new. In college, I studied illustrated books from an academic standpoint. I went to Vassar, where children's book writer Nancy Willard was on faculty. She introduced me to illustrator Barry Moser, and the interview he gave me was the centerpiece of my senior thesis. While I was there, I spent three years as a student assistant in Vassar's lab pre-school, and after graduation found work as an assistant teacher in a Montessori school, teaching 6-9 year olds. That year, I began to write a novel with my father – through the mail. I was in Chicago and he was in New York. We thought it would be a fun way to keep in touch. I wrote a chapter – then he wrote a chapter. We rewrote each other's chapters. And rewrote them again. It took a long time, but eventually that story was published as The Secret Life of Billie's Uncle Myron.<br /><br />Now I write full time in Brooklyn.  Here's a picture of on of my favorite corners in Cobble Hill, done by Lauren Castillo for our book together, What Happens on Wednesdays.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />

In its celebration of heroic deeds and feudal chivalric ideals, The Song of Roland reveals much about the culture of which it is a product, is invaluable to historians in its depiction of the evolution of ethics and Christianity, and is prized for its literary merit and beauty. The original, anonymous manuscript of The Song of Roland has been lost, so it is best represented by the 4000-line manuscript held at Oxford, which is believed to be a copy of a copy of the original. Written in an Anglo-Norman dialect, it blends legend and romance with historical accounts in telling the tale of Charlemagne's nephew, the beloved knight Roland and his death in the Pyrenees in 778, as the King and his men are returning home from a seven-year-long Spanish campaign. Historians believe the story was told for inspiration, to help rally troops to battle. The Song of Roland has been compared in importance to the Iliad and its depiction of honor and courage has engaged readers for centuries.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rodrigo Roa, born March 28, 1945, also known as Digong and Rody, is a Filipino politician who is the current president of the Philippines and the first from Mindanao to hold the office. He is the chairperson of PDP–Laban, the ruling political party in the Philippines. Duterte took office at age 71 on June 30, 2016, making him the oldest person to assume the Philippine presidency. The record was previously held by Sergio Osmeña at the age of 65. Born in Maasin, Southern Leyte, Duterte studied political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines University, graduating in 1968, before obtaining a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. He then worked as a lawyer and was a prosecutor for Davao City, before becoming vice mayor and, subsequently, mayor of the city in the wake of the Philippine Revolution of 1986. Duterte won seven terms and served as mayor of Davao for over 22 years.Frequently described as a populist and a nationalist, Duterte's political success has been aided by his vocal support for the extrajudicial killing of drug users and other criminals. Duterte's political career has also received scrutiny. Various human rights groups documented over 1,400 killings allegedly by death squads operating in Davao between 1998 and 2016. The victims were mainly drug users, petty criminals, and street children. A 2009 report by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights confirmed the "systematic practice of extrajudicial killings" by the Davao Death Squad. The Office of the Ombudsman closed an investigation in January 2016 stating that citing no evidence, but the case has since been reopened and reports of Duterte repeatedly confirmed that he personally killed criminal suspects as during his term as mayor of Davao surfaced.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong iyan..</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Buddha was born Siddhartha Gautama sometime between the 6th and 4th century BCE to Queen Mahamaya and King Suddhodana in Northern India or Nepal. The story of his birth is magical: supposedly, his mother gave painless birth to him in a grove of trees standing up by the light of a full moon. When he was born, his mother was visited by a soothsayer who declared that the young prince would become a 'renouncer,' someone who transcends the earthly life.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later his mother died and he was raised by her sister and his father. Siddhartha's father, as many parents do, sheltered his son from the outside, containing his life to within the palace walls. This, he believed, would allow Siddhartha to grow up to become a prince and warrior and not a renouncer as the soothsayer proclaimed. However, when Siddhartha grew older he took four chariot rides beyond the palace. These rides exposed the young prince to the suffering that stood in contrast to the luxury he had known. Siddhartha knew then that his purpose was to seek relief for this suffering.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS MUAHH</p><p>PA BRAINLIESTS AT PA FOLLOW</p><br />

</p><p>For over 18 years I have been passionate about taking pictures. It’s been my hobby and pastime. Now, I have decided to create my own corner of cyberspace to share my love of photography. My childhood consisted of a fascination of watching the environment and that's how I love to spend my time to take a snapshots. Photography is my complete existence. I spend countless hours looking at every book and image. There is nothing in my life except photography. We all have creative abilities; I was raised with no exposure to art and grew up believing that I had no talent. As for processing, I spend hours on each image until I am happy with the results.

                            24. biographical analysis about Carlos bulosan "my father goes to court"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This story was narrated by a four-year old kid whose family lived in a small town on Luzon. The farm of his father was destroyed by a Natural Calamity, which is flood. That is the reason why they preferred to live in a new place. They had a rich man neighbor, his children rarely go outside. Their house so tall, where their family can watch the kid’s (narrator) house. The rich man’s servants were always cooking some delicious food, like fried chicken, ham, and bacon. The kid’s family inhaling the heavenly spirit of those foods.</p><p></p><p>The narrator’s family always bond outside the Sun and bathing in the river. They always had a good time and a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watch them. As day past on, the rich man’s family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants always frying something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always close, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind.</p><p></p><p>One morning, a police man knocked on the door of the narrator’s house. The rich man had a complaint to them, because they were accused by stealing the spirit of the wealth and food.</p><p></p><p>When the trial came, the narrator’s family came first. After a few minutes, the rich man’s family came with a lawyer, their body was so thin and they look sick. The narrator’s father didn’t had any lawyer, he fight on his own. The trial starts, the lawyer questioned the narrator’s father. In the first question, the father didn’t agree that they stole the spirit of the wealth and the food. The father agreed in the second question, where he state that their family hung outside the rich man’s house and inhale the food. He also agreed that when the rich man’s family became sick, their family became strong and healthy.</p><p></p><p>The rich man’s children went in shyly. They are really thin and look like sick. When it is time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who question him. The rich man agreed that while their family having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the narrator’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooking the food. The narrator’s father commit to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collect some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father is ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told to the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed.</p><p></p><p>The judge told to the narrator’s father the story where his uncle died because of laughing. The judge like to hear narrator’s family laughing. The kid’s sisters started to laugh, and all of the people in the courtroom laughed and the judge’s laugh was the loudest of all.</p><p></p><p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p><p></p><p>Honestly, it was really a great story. I also join to their laughter at the end. It was really came from our Philippine Literature. I understand it more than other stories. Let us talk about the story, what can you say about the rich man? The reason why they look sick and pale is because they didn’t enjoy their life, look, he seldom make the children go outside. The other family, even though they are poor, they had a good bonding.</p><p></p><p>Carlos Bulosan was a really good author, not because he was a Filipino, but by his story. You can saw the Filipino skills to him, and Philippine Literature was really good.</p><p></p><p><strong>REFLECTION</strong></p><p></p><p>This story really gives you many lessons. First, don’t be afraid to the case that had been accused to you if you don’t have secrets. Second, just tell the truth. Third, you may not need a lawyer if you can fight by your own by just HONESTY. Fourth, don’t accused someone because you are more powerful than them and you are jealous to them. Lastly, just enjoy your life.</p><p></p><p>Accusing your fault to someone was really a bad thing to do, don’t ever do that. Here in Philippines, if you always laugh and laugh, it will makes your life even longer. I can relate some story in this one, rich family had everything but they don’t have the spirit of love in each other. In poor family they didn’t had thigs like the rich man but you can see the love in them.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan po sagot ko nagpakahirap ko pong sagutin yan sana naman po may brainliest yang sagot ko</p><br />
