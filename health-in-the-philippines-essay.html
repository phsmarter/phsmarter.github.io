Although, the Philippines can be seen as a beautiful and an up-and-coming country within the Asian economic community, it is still considered to be a developing country. The rich only count as 15% of the total population while the other 95% live in squatters (Espinas, Kiley). These squatter homes prohibit any electricity, plumbing and/or proper sanitation for the reason that these people haven’t paid respectable lots for their homes. Without these basic necessities, the well-being of the impoverished start to plunder. Acquiring a secured job with a weekly wage is difficult to come by, thus, money being a daily struggle.

The location is endless as it can be from the city all the way to the countryside. Although, this is type of medical care available once every few months or so no sudden help is readily available. This is considered to be an objective hazard because anything can happen to anyone at any given time. People will always need to seek medical attention and the fact that there is no medical access to the poor is frightening. In Diet Quality, Child Health, and Food Policies in Developing Countries, by Alok Bhargava, gives an interpretation on how children in developing countries need to be seen by a doctor before the first year of birth to see any potential complications (17). Without having a doctor or medical provider, this situation becomes difficult because of the lack of funds or opportunity. Thus, children just continuing their life not knowing the potential risks they may have to endure in the future.

                        <p><strong>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity​</strong></p><p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are two crucial aspects of a person's identity that have been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. While some argue that individuals should have the right to express themselves and love who they choose, others argue that certain sexual orientations and gender identities are unnatural or immoral. However, it is important to recognize that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, sexual orientation is a natural and normal part of human diversity. People can have different sexual orientations, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual. It is not a choice but rather an inherent characteristic of an individual's identity. People cannot control who they are attracted to, and it is not something that can be changed or "cured" through therapy or other methods. Therefore, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of sexual orientations.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, gender identity is also an inherent part of a person's identity. Gender identity refers to an individual's sense of their own gender, which can be male, female, or non-binary. Like sexual orientation, gender identity is not a choice but rather a part of who a person is. It is important to recognize and respect the gender identity of individuals, regardless of whether it aligns with their biological sex.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ often face discrimination and marginalization in society. This discrimination can manifest in many ways, including harassment, violence, and unequal treatment in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare. This discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, and can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>In addition to discrimination, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ also face legal barriers that limit their rights and freedoms. For example, in many countries, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and LGBTQ+ individuals are denied the right to adopt children or access fertility treatments. These legal barriers can further contribute to the marginalization and discrimination of LGBTQ+ individuals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected. Discrimination and marginalization of individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity are not only unfair but also harmful. It is important for society to recognize the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting world for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.
</p><p>
</p><p>Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Global warming is a word that practically everyone has heard of. However, the majority of us are still unsure of what it means. As a result, global warming refers to a steady increase in the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. There are a variety of things going on that are steadily raising the temperature. Our ice glaciers are fast disappearing due to global warming. </p><p></p><p>Global warming has evolved into a serious issue that requires our full attention. It is occurring due to a combination of factors rather than a single cause. These factors are both natural and man-made. The emission of greenhouse gases that are unable to escape from the planet, causing the temperature to rise, is one of the natural causes. Further, volcanic eruptions are also responsible for global warming. That is to say, these eruptions release tons of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming. Similarly, methane is also one big issue responsible for global warming.</p><p></p><p>Global warming can be stopped when combined efforts are put in. For that, individuals and governments, both have to take steps towards achieving it. We must begin with the reduction of greenhouse gas, they need to monitor the consumption of gasoline. Switch to a hybrid car and reduce the release of carbon dioxide. </p><p></p><p>All of us must realize the fact that our earth is not well. It needs to treatment and we can help it heal. The present generation must take up the responsibility of stopping global warming in order to prevent the suffering of future generations. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>informative</strong><strong> </strong><strong>essay</strong><strong> </strong><strong>about</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Mental</strong><strong> </strong><strong>health</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>According to WHO, there is no single 'official' definition of mental health. Mental health refers to a person's psychological, emotional, and social well-being; it influences what they feel and how they think, and behave. The state of cognitive and behavioural well-being is referred to as mental health. The term 'mental health' is also used to refer to the absence of mental disease. </p><p>Mental health means keeping our minds healthy. Mankind generally is more focused on keeping their physical body healthy. People tend to ignore the state of their minds. Human superiority over other animals lies in his superior mind. Man has been able to control life due to his highly developed brain. So, it becomes very important for a man to keep both his body and mind fit and healthy. Both physical and mental health are equally important for better performance and results.</p>#CarryOnlearning <p>[tex] \\  \\  \\ [/tex]</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />
