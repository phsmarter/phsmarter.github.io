                        No,because it will only increase broken families which mayy affect the children of those families.Remember that most suicidal people are depressed because of their family.I'm not.

                        <p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>I am not in favor of divorce generally, in that I favor marriage over divorce. Individuals and society at large benefit from marriage, so long as the marriage is based in a commitment to the family values that a good marriage requires (i.e., devotion to God, a righteous devotion to one another, a righteous devotion to the children of the marriage, a devotion to causes greater than oneself; although it seems paradoxical, a selfless devotion to a successful marriage makes oneself the happiest).</p><p></p><p>By the same token, I favor a means by which people who are married but should not be married can dissolve their marriages; therefore, I am in favor of divorce as such a means.</p><p></p><p>What kind of people should not be married? People who heinously abuse their spouses, and heinously abused spouses. People who abandon or desert or neglect their spouses. People who are incapable of upholding their basic marital obligations.</p><p></p><p>When should one be permitted to divorce, i.e., when is divorce justified? In cases of adultery, alcoholism or habitual drunkenness, desertion, abandonment, impotency at the time of marriage that was not disclosed in advance of marriage, when one’s spouse is convicted of a felony; when one treats his/her spouse cruelly to the extent of causing bodily injury or great mental distress, irreconcilable differences of the marriage, when one’s spouse suffers from incurable insanity, and domestic violence (which would include physical, sexual, or mental abuse of the other spouse and/or the child/children of the couple.</p><p></p><p>There needs to be less divorce. Divorce hurts the spouses, their children, and the community. Divorce does real damage for generations. Far too many marriages that could and should survive are thrown away by one or both spouses who are not aware of the fact (or who lose sight of the fact) that “what’s in it for me?” is well down the list of ways to create and foster a happy, successful marriage.</p><p></p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO</p><p>PA FOLLOW NARIN PO</p><p></p><br />

                            4. are you in favor of divorce and annulment in our country </h2><br />
                        <p>In my perspective, I'm in favor of divorce and annulment in our country. It's because not all of us are fortunate enough to end up with our one true love (if there such exist).Some ends up with a violent or a cheating husband/ wife and no matter how many chances you give them, they'll still end up doing the same. This results to being domestic abuse or violence and since both are legally binded,both can't be fully free causing on's suffering. Another thing is the effect of the children. The one who are affected most are those of the children, although it depends on situation. I have a friend whose parents are not really going well together, and she prefers or supports having her parents separate due to some private matters. All though I support divorce, I'm doubtful about annulment since it considers the marriage null and void at the beginning which means it goes to say that there was no such marraige in the first place. It's insulting especially in the eyes of God. All in all, I'm pro divorce however process in legally unbinding marriage should be properly dealt with and should ensure a rigid process only granting divorce to those who gravely needs it.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For me, Yes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I am a victim of an unhappy marriage. Not only me but many others who suffered in an unhappy and toxic marriage. Those who are happily married will never go to divorce. It never alter the purpose of the religion to have a bindrd family. Let's open our minds. Not all couples live the so called happily ever after. Will they need to prolong their agonies with each other? </p><br />

                            6. 150 words essay about divorce and abortion.Are you in favor that these two become legal in Philippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p>NO, Because Divorce has been seen to have a negative effect on the children involved, especially during the transition period as they deal with the separation of their parents. This may manifest in various ways such as diminished social skills, proneness to anger and increased irritability.Divorce also does not safeguard or promote the mental and physical health of children as it is difficult to cope with one’s problems when one’s family, their main support system, is broken apart.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the divorce may influence the child into losing faith in the concept of a family entirely, which leads to another negative effect of this process. If divorce were to be legalized, it would amplify the mentality that marriage can be easily broken, which may result in people putting less effort into making it last and ensuring that they will pick the right partner. The family is thus put into danger and further exposed to the risk of breaking apart.</p><p></p><p>Abortion should not be legalized in the Philippines for it is a painful surgery. Despite the use of such anesthetics, Almost 97% of women that committed abortions have been reported experiencing extreme pain during the procedure. Compared to other pains, researchers have rated the pain from abortion as more afflictive than a bone fracture, about the same as cancer pain. The use of more powerful general anesthetics can reduce the pain, but it increases the risk of cervical injury. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>sana makatulong </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        For me I'm not favor in Divorce, but i cannot give concrete explanation since i'm not married yet. But i will share to you  opinions of different personalities from a Newspaper Site.<br /><br />Phoemela Baranda, commercial and ramp model: "No, I'm not for divorce. If we legalize divorce, it's like legalizing separation. I feel that married couples should stay together and try to work things out. Its like giving an unsuccessful marriage another choice instead of trying to take another chance and working on their marriages. So for me, it's not a good idea."<br /><br />Sandy Daza, owner, Mai Thai: "No, I'm not in favor of divorce. I feel divorce is so centered on the person. Before you consider divorce, consider the children who are going to be affected. I feel that any relationship can work as long as it's God-focused. When I say God-focused, its reading the Bible. There are instructions in the Bible on how you should be as husband, wife, teacher, employer, employee and if you obey them; which is not very easy in fact; I think any relationship can work. The Bible also says that what God has put together let no one separate."<br /><br />There you go. They have their thoughts. But i think divorce is too vague to happen in the Philippines. Since most of our lawmakers in the Congress love their "wives" and are afraid of them. <br /><br />__________________<br />Hope this helps ^_^<br /><br /><br />I am in favor of legalizing divorce because if the couple has fallen out of love, there is no use in staying together, if we say that they  should stay together for the sake of their children both will be unhappy so with the children because they will hear them fight and will not be a good environment for them<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mar. 4, 2020) On February 4, 2020, a bill proposing the legalization of divorce in the Philippines was approved by the Committee on Population and Family Relations of the Philippine House of Representatives. Currently, the Philippines and the Vatican are the only two sovereign states in the world that still prohibit divorce.</p><p></p><p>Opponents of this initiative argue that, if divorce is allowed, it will destroy the institution of marriage. The author of the bill, Rep. Edcel Lagman, challenged this argument, stating in his sponsorship speech for the bill that, because the proposed divorce law “cannot undo centuries of dearly held Filipino customs and traditions honoring and celebrating marriage and the family[, m]arriage and the family are and will still be at the heart of the Filipino way of life.” Lagman further stated that spouses who are willing to consider divorce do so when they no longer have a functioning marriage. And it is because of failed marriages and the impossibility of reconciliation that the bill’s explanatory note says that the Philippine state has the duty to provide spouses in such relationships with the possibility of divorce.</p><p></p><p>The bill looks upon divorce as a women’s rights issue. The bill’s explanatory note states that “[n]ot being able to get out of an eventual loveless, unhappy, even abusive marriage is a human rights concern for women,” while section 3(4) of the bill provides that the proposed divorce law is “pro-woman legislation” because it would allow Philippine wives to be liberated from abusive relationships and “regain dignity and self-esteem.”</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, the bill contains a general rule providing for six-month cooling-off period after the filing of a petition for divorce during which the court must pursue efforts aimed at reuniting and reconciling the parties. Exceptions to the rule would include instances in which one of the spouses is sentenced to imprisonment for six years, or when the spouses have been separated for at least five years.</p><p></p><p>The Committee on Population and Family Relations of the Philippine House of Representatives is expected to refer the approved bill to the full House for further analysis and debate.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>thats it hope it helps</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It terminates a marriage based on a ground that occurred during the marriage, which makes the marital relationship no longer tenable, regardless of the spouse's psychological constitution. A divorce law will provide a straightforward remedy to a marital failure. It will benefit Filipinos wherever they are.</p><p></p><p></p><p>try nyo lang po ito </p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope it's help </p><p></p><p>#CARRY ON LEARNING</p><p>#LEARNING IS ON BRAINLY </p><br />

Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."<strong>Matthew 19:9</strong> and <strong>Luke 16:18</strong> "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery."It is a Sin against God because it is a sign of rebellion to his sovereignty.Misunderstanding of the given Bible verses.Are you in favor of divorce in our country? What are its advantages and disadvantages for our families?<p>We already have Annulment which acts like divorce. In the given verse above, you can read that Jesus permitted divorce ONLY if one of the spouses commits sexual sin like adultery. <strong>So, I'm only in favor of divorce as being a last resort.</strong></p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><p>One misunderstood verse is "...what God put together man cannot separate". It is mostly misunderstood that if two agree to marry it means that it is by the will of God. This is sometimes wrong because some couples marry each other without the guidance of God. Hence, a few days later they fight/argue with each other and would want to separate eventually.</p><p>Spouses falling into an abusive relationship can have the choice to live separately from the abusive partner. Divorce can give people time to heal and start over a life truly pleasing to God.</p><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><p>Lack of divorce or even annulment can lead to an abusive home environment.

                        No. for me I am not in favor of legalizing divorce in our country. Because First of all, according to the bible Genesis 2:23-25 Marriage is a covenant, a sacred bond between a man and a woman instituted by and publicly entered into before God and normally consummated by sexual intercourse. It is the intimacy of marriage that intimates of all human relationships, uniting a man and a woman in a "one-flesh" union. For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her." Genesis 2:24: Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. <br /> <br /><br /><br />
