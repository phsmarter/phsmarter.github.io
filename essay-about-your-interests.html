Last but not least, the second floor consists of a library and a wall with our canvases and different artwork. </p><p></p><p>My room is the best out of all the rooms. It is extremely comfortable. I have an enormous bed, which is the best part. I have a desk where I have my computer and it is where I do my homework after school. Outside my house, we have a large backyard and a swimming pool. Our garden is filled with palm trees and a variety of different flowers with fruits. The garage is where all the cars are parked, quite boring in my opinion. As a matter of fact, we also have an outdoor kitchen, it is where all the good stuff come from. To sum everything up, my house is truly a magical place, and I am very grateful for it. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps you :)</p><br />

And discuss how it will affect you as a student in today's generation?please help:(​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>As a student in today's generation, I am concerned about the issue of climate change and its potential impact on my future. Climate change is a global issue that has been caused by human activities such as deforestation, industrialization, and the burning of fossil fuels. The effects of climate change are numerous, ranging from rising sea levels and temperatures to more frequent and intense natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. In this essay, I will discuss how climate change will affect me as a student in today's generation.</p><p></p><p>The first way that climate change will impact me as a student is through the availability and quality of education. Climate change has already caused several natural disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires, which have forced schools to close temporarily or permanently. These closures can result in a significant loss of instructional time and can negatively impact students' academic performance. Furthermore, climate change may affect the quality of education by reducing funding for schools and universities due to the increased cost of natural disaster response and mitigation efforts.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, climate change will affect the job market and career opportunities for me and my fellow students. As the world shifts towards renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, there will be a decline in jobs in industries that rely on fossil fuels, such as coal mining and oil drilling. This shift in the job market may result in limited job opportunities for students who are majoring in fields that are related to fossil fuels, such as petroleum engineering or geology.</p><p></p><p>Finally, climate change will impact my overall quality of life, including my health and well-being. Rising temperatures can lead to an increase in air pollution, which can cause respiratory problems and allergies. Natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes can cause physical and emotional trauma, which can negatively impact mental health. Additionally, climate change can result in food and water scarcity, which can lead to malnutrition and hunger.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, climate change is a global issue that will impact me and my fellow students in several ways. It will affect the availability and quality of education, the job market and career opportunities, and our overall quality of life. As students, we can play a role in mitigating the effects of climate change by advocating for policies that promote sustainable development and reducing our own carbon footprint. It is essential that we take action now to protect our future and the future of generations to come.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>College is my first step to achieve my dream. Currently I am a student in high school. I do my best to keep my grades up, because I know that they will help me into college. I dream of going to UCSD to get a bachelors degree in biology, then coming back to Stockton to attend UOP and getting a Doctorates degree in Pharmacy. By the time I get this degree, I will be around 28, so I hope that it will all be worth it.             After I have a doctorate, I plan to get a job working for a company under their research division. I hope I can lend a hand in finding new, more effective ways of administering drugs to patents. Or I could possibly design self-administration drugs for those at home type of people. Or perhaps I could improve packaging designs for the medication. The possibilities are endless!             Outside of my job, I plan to buy a large home. I dream of settling down in an urban area, someplace that's not too big. A Stockton type of town, but not Stockton. Possibly Monterey or Carmel. Hopefully by the time I get a house, I'll have a wife and can start a family. I dream of having a son to carry on the family name.             As you can see, I have big plans for my future. I plan to make something of myself, and not to give up. I have a major fear of failure, and I won't let it get to me. My parents expect a lot out of me, and I think I have done a good job so far. My dreams are what keep me going; they are an object for me to strive for. I will obtain that object one day.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>SANA MAKATULONG</p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO</p><p>PWEDE POBA KAHIT BIOLOGY??</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Senior High School Strand</strong></p><p>Senior High School is a two-year specialized upper secondary education program in which students can specialize based on their aptitude, hobbies, and school competence. The substance of a student's subjects in Grades 11 and 12 will be determined by his or her professional path. Subjects in SHS are divided into two categories: Core Curriculum and Tracks.</p><p></p><p><strong>THE ESSENTIAL CURRICULUM</strong></p><p>The Core Curriculum is divided into seven learning areas. Languages, Literature, Communication, Mathematics, Philosophy, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences are the disciplines in question. The SHS curriculum includes current topics from various General Education subjects.</p><p></p><p><strong>TRACKS</strong></p><p>Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, and Sports and Arts are the three tracks available to Senior High School students. Business, Accountancy, and Management (BAM); Humanities, Education, and Social Sciences (HESS); and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) .</p><p></p><p><strong>STEM STRAND</strong></p><p>When implemented in the actual world, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are intertwined disciplines. The focus on advanced concepts and themes distinguishes the STEM curriculum from the other strands and tracks.</p><p></p><p>You can train to be a pilot, an architect, an astrophysicist, a biologist, a chemist, an engineer, a dentist, a nutritionist, a nurse, a doctor, and many more professions by following the track. This track is recommended for those who are also interested in Marine Engineering.</p><p></p><p>STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) teaches critical thinking and innovation. Students can establish mental habits that will help them succeed in any subject by focusing on logical thought processes and problem-solving. Students are challenged to think critically and come up with their own ideas as part of their STEM training.</p><p></p><p>A great STEM class promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, perseverance, teamwork, and communication. Good STEM education enables students to see the connections between these courses and to acquire soft skills for the world in which we all live and work.</p><p></p><p>I like the critical thinking to be enhanced and in STEM strand, it will be well practiced with the help of the assessment given all throughout the curriculum.</p><p></p><p><strong>Other Senior High School Strands</strong></p><p><strong>1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>My New-found Interest</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>A few years ago, I have discovered that <strong>I like reading books</strong>, especially ones that are more obscure and unique. I discovered this when I visited our school library for some reference material. I do not usually go to the library, as almost all information that I need can already be found on the internet. But during that time, I needed to have a hardcopy reference. Therefore, I spent some time in the library. Who knew that it could actually lead it to my love for reading? I did not realize yet that time it was actually the beginning.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Magical Moment</strong>
</p><p>I remember that I was looking for a particular science book for my reference. It was crunch time already with my report, so I must find that science reference. However, while I was looking, I came across this old book about a young girl and her desire to have a swimming pool in their backyard. The book cover was nondescript, just an image of a young girl in pig tails. It was hard bound with olive green color and smelled really old and musty. I am not sure why I started reading it, but I actually did! And I was so excited about it! Eventually I was able to find my science reference and borrowed my new-found book together with it. </p><p></p><p><strong>My Future Career?</strong>
</p><p>Until today I kept asking myself, why did I ever get interested to open that book in the library? Was there some magical moment or some divine intervention leading me to that book? But in any case, that incident got me started into reading. After that, I would visit the library to look for other similar books. Furthermore, it developed in me an inclination to look online for books with good reviews. And I get to spend many days in bookstores in malls. There are bookstores that allow people to stay inside, lounge in the store, and read some books. I like doing that in some of my free time. Also, I have this feeling that I must at least read one physical book for every five online books I read. I also started following online writing platforms and fanfiction websites. I needed to see which ones are new releases and if they are actually good. Nowadays I am getting interested in pursuing creative writing. I want to learn how to be a creative writer. Who knows! One day that might be a career I am willing to take in the future.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rodrigo Roa, born March 28, 1945, also known as Digong and Rody, is a Filipino politician who is the current president of the Philippines and the first from Mindanao to hold the office. He is the chairperson of PDP–Laban, the ruling political party in the Philippines. Duterte took office at age 71 on June 30, 2016, making him the oldest person to assume the Philippine presidency. The record was previously held by Sergio Osmeña at the age of 65. Born in Maasin, Southern Leyte, Duterte studied political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines University, graduating in 1968, before obtaining a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. He then worked as a lawyer and was a prosecutor for Davao City, before becoming vice mayor and, subsequently, mayor of the city in the wake of the Philippine Revolution of 1986. Duterte won seven terms and served as mayor of Davao for over 22 years.Frequently described as a populist and a nationalist, Duterte's political success has been aided by his vocal support for the extrajudicial killing of drug users and other criminals. Duterte's political career has also received scrutiny. Various human rights groups documented over 1,400 killings allegedly by death squads operating in Davao between 1998 and 2016. The victims were mainly drug users, petty criminals, and street children. A 2009 report by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights confirmed the "systematic practice of extrajudicial killings" by the Davao Death Squad. The Office of the Ombudsman closed an investigation in January 2016 stating that citing no evidence, but the case has since been reopened and reports of Duterte repeatedly confirmed that he personally killed criminal suspects as during his term as mayor of Davao surfaced.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong iyan..</p><br />
