                                            Instructions. Given the issue, write your stand. Defend it using your claims/arguments For each argument, give an evidence. Write your answers in a separate sheet of paper Example: Cycling to commute to work or school Stand: In favor Argument Health benefits, environment-friendly Evidence: Cycling as a mode of transport should be promoted since it has several health benefits. It's easy on the joints. When you sit on a bike, you put your weight on a pair of bones in the pelvis called the ischial tuberosities. "That makes it good for anyone with joint pain or related stiffness," says Dr. Clare Safran-Norton, a physical therapist at Harvard -affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. In addition, it can save non- renewable resources. According to the Encyclopedia of Energy, bicycles can cover a given distance using one-thousandth of the fuel that an automobile uses. It cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change and reduces pollutants.​</a>

Write your answers in a separate sheet of paper Example: Cycling to commute to work or school Stand: In favor Argument Health benefits, environment-friendly Evidence: Cycling as a mode of transport should be promoted since it has several health benefits. It's easy on the joints. When you sit on a bike, you put your weight on a pair of bones in the pelvis called the ischial tuberosities. "That makes it good for anyone with joint pain or related stiffness," says Dr. Clare Safran-Norton, a physical therapist at Harvard -affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. In addition, it can save non- renewable resources. According to the Encyclopedia of Energy, bicycles can cover a given distance using one-thousandth of the fuel that an automobile uses. It cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change and reduces pollutants.​</h2><br />

Based on a scientific journal discussing Green Product Innovation and the impact of using stainless straw by Lily Suhaily et al, published in 2020 in the International Journal of Applied Business and International Management, it is stated that the production and use of stainless steel is an effective way to reduce plastic due to its continual use, this step can also prevent marine pollution by plastic, and the use of stainless straw is also safe because it can be cleaned.</p><p></p><p><strong>See more examples of issues and arguments</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9261982</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
