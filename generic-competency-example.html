There are hares living in a cold, snowy, polar region. All of the hares arebrown* and many of them are killed and eaten by other animals each year, so moreare born than survive.b. These hares are competing for life and struggling to survive, partly by tryingto avoid predators, to "not be the one who gets eaten."c. Each hare is a little bit different from other hares, but one time a few haresferentare born albino, white, because of a mutation in the genes.d. This variation in color helps the albino hares to survive. Against the whitesnow, predators have a harder time seeing them, so more of the albino hares areable to survive and therefore to reproduce.e. In the next generation, there are more white hares, because the white hairgene is passed on. In this generation, too, more white hares survive and reproduce.They pass the albino trait on to their offspring, who also survive and reproduce morethan do the brown hares. Gradually, there are more and more white hares in thepopulation, until the entire population is made of white hares.​</a>

Learning Competency Describe techniques in separating mixtures such as decantation
Directions: Read and understand the entire selection. However, there are incorrect information gue Your obsto
identify the error and then accomplish the table below by following these steps:
1. Copy the error and explain why this is wrong.
2. Write a correction of the identified error.
3. Then explain why your correction is right
Selection:
Decantation can be used to separate two liquids that have the same densities as long as they are immisciblia
For example, water and oil form two separate layers when mixed together. Water being danser setties at the bottom
and oil floats on water, forming two distinct layers. The separation can be done by pouring water out into a different
container, leaving behind the denser oil in the original container Generally, this type of separation is awed because
it is difficult to pour out the top layer without pouring out some part of the bottom layar

                                            Background Any biological organisms that are not originally found in certain locality are known as invasive species or alien species. Since they are not considered to be native members of a certain population, they could alter the ecological and evolutionary mechanism in the community by competing against environmental requirements or affecting the possible gene flow of those populations that originally inhabiting a certain locale. Situation A certain Filipino agriculture community reported cases of new species that are commonly found in their area. Examples are trees and shrubs found in the highland community forest or new types of freshwater animals that serve as predators in the native fauna of lakes and streams in the community. Generally, these invasive species serve as a threat to the local community but unfortunately, people within the community are unaware of the serious effects of these invasive species. Therefore, a collective citizen science is necessary and as an expert about evolutionary mechanisms and relationships, you are requested to draft a position paper that will be addressed to the local community and policy makers. Task Select one alien species that are already reported in the Philippines. Explain why this was considered as an invasive species and what was the usefulness or harmfulness it had gave in a certain Filipino community. Afterwards, write a local action plan that you will propose to the local policy makers how you are going to inform the general public on a possible long-term impact of these alien species.​</a>

Direction: Identify the part of the theory that corresponds to the example (The storyof a population of brown hares in a polar region becoming white hares) given below.write the corresponding number on the space provided.a. There are hares living in a cold, snowy, polar region. All of the hares arebrown* and many of them are killed and eaten by other animals each year, so moreare born than survive.b. These hares are competing for life and struggling to survive, partly by tryingto avoid predators, to "not be the one who gets eaten."c. Each hare is a little bit different from other hares, but one time a few haresferentare born albino, white, because of a mutation in the genes.d. This variation in color helps the albino hares to survive. Against the whitesnow, predators have a harder time seeing them, so more of the albino hares areable to survive and therefore to reproduce.e. In the next generation, there are more white hares, because the white hairgene is passed on. In this generation, too, more white hares survive and reproduce.They pass the albino trait on to their offspring, who also survive and reproduce morethan do the brown hares. Gradually, there are more and more white hares in thepopulation, until the entire population is made of white hares.​</h2><br />

identify the error and then accomplish the table below by following these steps:
1. Copy the error and explain why this is wrong.
2. Write a correction of the identified error.
3. Then explain why your correction is right
Selection:
Decantation can be used to separate two liquids that have the same densities as long as they are immisciblia
For example, water and oil form two separate layers when mixed together. Water being danser setties at the bottom
and oil floats on water, forming two distinct layers. The separation can be done by pouring water out into a different
container, leaving behind the denser oil in the original container Generally, this type of separation is awed because
it is difficult to pour out the top layer without pouring out some part of the bottom layar

Since they are not considered to be native members of a certain population, they could alter the ecological and evolutionary mechanism in the community by competing against environmental requirements or affecting the possible gene flow of those populations that originally inhabiting a certain locale.
