                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way. If you were to be asked about the bill, what is your stand it? Do you support the bill into becoming a law or would you agree on what the opposition stated? Tell us what is on your mind! Write a persuading three-paragraph essay focusing on your position about it.
On the first paragraph, briefly discuss the bill with your stand. On the second paragraph, enumerate and explain your reasons and on the concluding paragraph, give your final message addressed to the government and fellowmen.

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                            2. ESSAY 
1. Why is the recognition of human rights?
2. The oldest written rules for human rights maybe considered is have come from different religious writings. What do you think is the relationships between religion and human rights?
3. In your own words, explain the golden rule in 500 words and give an example.
4. How does the bill of rights of article 3 of the 1987 constitution affect you as an individual and your family as a whole.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The recognition of human rights is important to uphold the values of fairness, respect and dignity for each individual, regardless of culture, ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, or age. Human rights are granted to ensure that all individuals are treated with respect and allowed the same opportunity to thrive. The recognition of human rights is necessary to protect individuals from violations of their rights, including physical and sexual abuse, discrimination, denial of basic needs, unrestricted migration, and oppression. It is also essential to maintain international stability and to preserve peace and security between nations.</p><p></p><p>2. There is a strong relationship between religion and human rights in that many religious teachings emphasize the importance of respecting individual rights and treating others with respect and compassion. The teachings of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, for example, all emphasize that people should strive to treat others with dignity and utmost respect. This can be seen in the Golden Rule: "love your neighbor as yourself." In addition, many religious systems recognize the inherent rights of individuals to free speech, religious practice, and self-determination, which are also human rights recognized in modern legal systems.</p><p></p><p>3. The Golden Rule is an ethical principle that provides an invaluable lesson on how to treat others: to treat others as you would want them to treat you. This simple rule can be found in many religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. It is commonly expressed as “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” and encourages people to act in the same manner that they would want others to act towards them. The importance of this rule lies in the fact that it involves taking into consideration the feelings of others and being considerate towards them, instead of simply doing whatever you want.</p><p></p><p>As an example of the Golden Rule, consider the following scenario: imagine you are walking down the street, and you notice someone in need of assistance. If you applied the Golden Rule in this situation, you would stop and take the time to help the person, considering that if the situation was reversed, you would expect someone else to help you. By treating others kindly and lending a helping hand when necessary, you will experience the rewards of showing and receiving kindness.</p><p></p><p>4. Article 3 of the 1987 Constitution states that the Filipino people have certain unalienable rights, and that protecting and promoting these rights is the duty of the government. This includes the right to life and liberty, the right to due process and protection from arbitrary arrest and punishment, the right to freedom of speech and assembly, the right to vote, the right to education, and the right to property and security. </p><p></p><p>For individual citizens and families, this means that these rights are guaranteed to them and should not be violated. This provides families with security and assurance that the government is looking out for their best interests. For example, the right to vote ensures that individuals and families have a say in choosing their leaders, which can have a direct impact on their lives. The right to due process gives individuals a fair trial, allowing them to hear the charges against them and have the opportunity to defend themselves in court. These rights also ensure better protection from discrimination, oppression, and arbitrary punishment. In essence, Article 3 of the 1987 Constitution provides legal protection to individuals and their families, allowing them to live and flourish in a stable and just environment.</p><br />

                            7. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way. If you were to be asked about the bill, what is your stand it? Do you support the bill into becoming a law or would you agree on what the opposition stated? Tell us what is on your mind! Write a persuading three-paragraph essay focusing on your position about it.
On the first paragraph, briefly discuss the bill with your stand. On the second paragraph, enumerate and explain your reasons and on the concluding paragraph, give your final message addressed to the government and fellowmen.
Use the following rubric as your guide.
Criteria
Focus (concentrates on a specific topic that is clear, significant, and supportable)
Persuasive Techniques (uses logical and emotional appeals; avoids misconception)
Clarity of ideas (clearly presents reasons, facts, and opinion as supports
