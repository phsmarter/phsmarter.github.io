All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</a>

Teresa B. Berondo"Man is by nature a social animal.” This is a famous line by Aristotle,a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take itsmeaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actualwords?Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, itcan literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms likelanguage and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense,human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company ofothers to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness canbe found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also,people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectivesin life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, familybackground and other personal qualities.

                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                                            The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

A key goal for historical critics is to realize the effect of a literary work upon its original readers.3. A main goal for formalist critics is to determine how elements of form (style, structure, tone, imagery, etc.) work togetherwith the text's content to shape its effects upon readers.-4. The essence of structuralism is the belief that things cannot be understood in isolation, they have to be seen in thecontext of larger structures which contain them.5. Feminist criticism attempts to correct this balance by evaluating and combatung such attitudes-by questioning, forexample, why none of the characters in Shakespeare's play Othello ever challenge the right of a husband to murder a wife accused ofadultery.6. Gender Crrücism is originally an offshoot of feminist movements, gender criticism today includes a number ofapproaches, Including the so-called "masculinist approach recently advocated by poet Robert Bly.7. Like an essay, a critique uses a informal, academic writing style and has a clear structure, that is, an introduction, bodyand conclusion8.

Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

                            1. essay about human behavior</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Human behavior is the potential and expressed capacity (mentally, physically, and socially) of human individuals or groups to respond to internal and external stimuli throughout their life.While specific traits of one's personality, temperament, and genetics may be more consistent, other behaviors will change as one moves along different stages of their life, i.e. from birth through adolescence, adulthood, and, for example, parenthood and retirement.</p><p>
Behavior is also driven, in part, by thoughts and feelings, which provide insight into individual psyche, revealing such things as attitudes and values. Human behavior is shaped by psychological traits, as personality types vary from person to person, producing different actions and behavior. Extraverted people, for instance, are more likely than introverted people to participate in social activities like parties.</p><p>The behavior of humans (just as of other organisms) falls upon a spectrum, whereby some behaviors are common while others unusual, and some are acceptable while others beyond acceptable limits. The acceptability of behavior depends heavily upon social norms and is regulated by various means of social control, partly due to the inherently conformist nature of human society in general. Thus, social norms also condition behavior, whereby humans are pressured into following certain rules and displaying certain behaviors that are deemed acceptable or unacceptable depending on the given society or culture.
</p><p>Human behavior is studied by the social sciences, which include psychology, sociology, economics, and anthropology. In sociology, behavior may broadly refer to all basic human actions, including those which possess no meaning; actions directed at no person. Behavior in this general sense should not be mistaken with social behavior. Social behavior, a subset of human behavior that accounts for actions directed at others, is concerned with the considerable influence of social interaction and culture, as well as ethics, social environment, authority, persuasion, and coercion.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. Culture reflects the moral values and ethical norms governing how people should behave and interact with others.</p><p></p><p>B. In this article I argue that, in order to understand the deep historical and present differences in the quality and quantity of punishment (as measured by imprisonment) between Italy and the United States, it is necessary to situate the specific punitive histories of these two societies within their cultural traditions. </p><p></p><p>Such traditions are deeply marked by different concepts and experiences of religion, i.e. Catholicism and Protestantism. However, the relation between religious ethos and punitive practices is not one of causal determinism.</p><p></p><p> Rather, cultural embeddedness fashions conceptual and rhetorical toolkits that allow for the shaping of specific punitive orientations, which respond also to other fundamental features of society, such as socio-economic conditions and political cultures and regimes.</p><p></p><br />

All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</h2><br />

When climbing high peaks, some mountaineers breathe from bottles of pure O2. In a short essay (100-150 words), relate these behaviors to the mechanism of O2 transoort in the human body and physiological interactions with our gaseous environment.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Acclimatization to the altitude is an important part of preparation for the athletes. Air at the altitude contains around 21% oxygen. However, as a person goes up, the partial pressure of oxygen changes, it rather decreases. It is the hypoxia training or the altitude training that the athletes undergo at the sea level.</p><p></p><p>Usually, when we inhale oxygen, from the alveoli, it passes into the blood and is transferred to the tissues. This gaseous exchange occurring between the alveoli and blood is due to the pressure gradient. The pressure in the alveoli is greater than the pressure in the blood surrounding the lungs. Hence, oxygen travels from the lungs to the blood.</p><br />

Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world.

Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

                            15. The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

A key goal for historical critics is to realize the effect of a literary work upon its original readers.3. A main goal for formalist critics is to determine how elements of form (style, structure, tone, imagery, etc.) work togetherwith the text's content to shape its effects upon readers.-4. The essence of structuralism is the belief that things cannot be understood in isolation, they have to be seen in thecontext of larger structures which contain them.5. Feminist criticism attempts to correct this balance by evaluating and combatung such attitudes-by questioning, forexample, why none of the characters in Shakespeare's play Othello ever challenge the right of a husband to murder a wife accused ofadultery.6. Gender Crrücism is originally an offshoot of feminist movements, gender criticism today includes a number ofapproaches, Including the so-called "masculinist approach recently advocated by poet Robert Bly.7.

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1.

Human interaction is very important in building a nation because it helps people form social groups that can work together towards common goals.</p><p></p><br />
