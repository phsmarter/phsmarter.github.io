                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>#Carryonlearning</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>School uniforms are a tradition which has been going on for decades. There are continuous debates about the positive and the negative effects of schools imposing uniformity of clothes.</p><p></p><p>Schools are educational institutions where children go not only to learn textbooks but to grow as an overall human being. Schools also have the task of teaching children about the taste in clothes and tell them what is appropriate for what occasion.</p><p></p><p>School uniforms are a simple form of clothes for students during their stay at school during the school hours, and outside during official school activities. A school uniform is common in most of the schools. They have direct orders to wear the school uniform without fail.</p><p></p><p>School uniforms bring a certain beauty to the school students. Uniforms are practical since students do not need to fret about what to wear each new day. Besides, school uniform makes each student a part of the school. They are unified under their school name.</p><p></p><p>other practicalities of school uniforms are things like it is easy to spot a child in their uniform. Hence, it is difficult for students to bunk school without being spotted by others in the street. Many students do not realize the practicality of school uniforms, and there are many.</p><p></p><p>Scientists beilieve that with school uniforms, children learn to appreciate and respect it as a part of the tradition and strive to uphold its sanctity. It helps students to be more organized and not get distracted from their lessons. Hence, it helps to increase their overall academic achievement.</p><p></p><p>School uniforms also instil a sense of belonging to their school and unite students. It helps to discipline students and maintain order. It is because they are not distracted by their unique clothing. It helps students to behave seriously within the walls of the institution as well as outside since they are aware that people will recognize their school uniform.</p><p>On the other hand, school uniforms help to reduce conflicts between students which result from differences in their social status and class. It is difficult for students to gauge their peer’s financial condition if they are wearing school uniforms. But the other group maintains that students belonging to wealthy families try to show their status by wearing expensive accessories like watches, pens, etc. or perfumes, and such other things. In this case, the school uniform has no purpose.</p><p>It is difficult for low-income families to buy school uniforms every passing year, and it may create a strain in their budget. Hence, school uniforms are not cheap and can feel unnecessarily expensive for low-income families.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hence, it isn’t easy to choose a side when it comes to the practicality of school uniforms. But, in my opinion, I cannot imagine my school without any uniform. Even though we may not have liked it when we were in school, looking back, it brings back nostalgic memories.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>B.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I'm not sure about it :(</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many people assume the Bible condemns taking one’s own life. However, even a careful reader will search in vain for any explicit prohibition of self-killing in the Bible. In fact, the biblical attitude toward suicide ranges from ambivalence to praise. There are seven unambiguous examples of suicide in the Bible: Abimelech, mortally wounded by a millstone, ordered his armor-bearer to dispatch him to avoid the suggestion he had been slain by the woman who had thrown the stone (Judg 9:52-54); the prophet Ahithophel hanged himself after betraying David (2Sam 17:23); Zimri burned down his house around himself after military defeat (1Kgs 16:18); and the more familiar stories of Saul and his armor-bearer (1Sam 1:1-6; 1Chr 10:1-6), Samson, (Judg 16:28), and, of course, Jesus’ disciple Judas—although it is only in Matthew’s Gospel where he kills himself (Matt 27:3-5; compare with Acts 1:18). There is nothing in any of these stories to suggest that the biblical narrators disapprove of the characters’ suicides.</p><p></p><p>Suicide in the ancient world did not carry the same negative connotations as it does today. For Greco-Roman philosophers, suicide in correct circumstances constituted a “noble death.” Socrates (469-399 B.C.E.) chose to drink hemlock rather than endure exile, a choice enthusiastically endorsed by most of the philosophical schools at the time. If carried out for country or friends, or in the face of intolerable pain, incurable disease, devastating misfortune or shame, or to avoid capture on the battlefield, suicide constituted a noble death. Each of the instances of suicide found in the Bible fits comfortably with noble-death ideals. Saul’s death, for example, finds a strikingly close parallel with that of the Greek general Publius, who, when similarly wounded on the battlefield ordered his armor-bearer to kill him (Plutarch, Crassus 25.11).</p><p></p><p>Two of the incidents of self-killing in the Bible exhibit a positive attitude toward suicide. Arguably, the author of the Gospel of Matthew intends the reader to interpret the disciple Judas’s hanging as an act of remorse. Judas repents (metamelētheis) and returns the blood money that he received for turning Jesus over to the authorities who executed him (Matt 27:3). Judas acknowledges that he has “sinned in betraying innocent blood” (Matt 27:4). His suicide may be interpreted as an act of atonement because he himself carries out the penalty laid down in the Hebrew Bible for taking a life: “no expiation can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of him who shed it” (Num 35:33; see also Lev 24:17). There is no hint of condemnation of Judas’s self-killing in Matthew. If anything, it is a solution to his guilt rather than something that adds to it.</p><p></p><p>The Israelite leader Samson’s suicide is interpreted positively. The narrator lingers over the body count caused by Samson’s suicidal killing at a pagan temple; it is clear that God gave Samson the strength to carry out this massacre. Human and divine approval is sealed by the celebratory conclusion: “so those he killed at his death were more than those he had killed during his life” (Judg 16:30; compare with Heb 11:32-36). While modern readers may be less inclined to share the narrator’s view that Samson’s suicide should be commended, there are parallel examples of heroic suicides in contemporary film, such as Spock in The Wrath of Khan, astronauts in Armageddon and Deep Impact, and especially the character of Russell in Independence Day.</p><p></p><p>The Judeo-Christian condemnation of suicide does not, therefore, begin in the Bible. Although the commandment against killing (Exod 20:13) is commonly believed to include killing oneself, there is simply no evidence in either the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament to sustain any moral condemnation of suicide.</p><p></p><p>The views expressed on this subject are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of SBL. Individuals personally struggling with this issue should seek immediate professional help.

                            8. A complete set of a grade school uniform requires 1 3/4 metersf a white cloth for the blouse and 2 1/3 meters of blue cloth for the pants. How much clothing material of white cloth is required for 35 sets of uniform?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>To find the clothing material required for 35 sets of uniforms, represented by x, we can start by defining variables for the amount of white cloth required (since the question only asks for a certain value, which is a big thing to keep in mind when answering math problems; to give the relevant answers only, unless otherwise.)</p><p>Let's just use a for the white cloth requirement.</p><p>We know that a, or 1 [tex]\frac{3}{4}[/tex], meters of cloth are required to make [tex]\frac{x}{35}[/tex], or 1, sets, which, to be honest, would seem incorrect, because widths, and not lengths of cloth, are the usually required measurements for garment-making. But, we will stick to this measurement, as this is what is given.</p><p>To make 35 sets of uniforms, we will require 35a meters of cloth. represented in algebraic form:</p><p>[tex]x = 35a[/tex]</p><p>To find x, we may substitute a with 1 [tex]\frac{3}{4}[/tex]:</p><p>[tex]x = 35(1\frac{3}{4} )[/tex]</p><p>And then multiply:</p><p>[tex]x = 35(1+\frac{3}{4} )\\x = 35 + \frac{105}{4}\\x = \frac{140 + 105}{4} \\x = \frac{245}{4} \\x = 61.25[/tex]</p><p>Thus, 61.25 meters of white cloth are required to make 35 sets of uniforms.</p><p>I hope this helps you! :) </p><br />
