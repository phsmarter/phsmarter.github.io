Learning Task 4: Read the sample abstract of a completed quantitative research. Identify
the variables of the study and construct a conceptual framework.
Research Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
Example of a Research 
Hypothesis
Question: Is there a significant 
relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?

The primary subject of this research study will consist of the senior high students enrolled in Antonio A. Maceda integrated school, year 2021-2022 in the city of Manila NCR. The respondents will be limited, only to the boys and girls age of 16-25 years old  who had a past and present relationship as well as in uncommitted relationship. Moreover, the study would be done through the utilization of Data gathering that the researcher had made, so the respondents will be chosen based on their experiences in their partner. With these strategies the researchers will be able to know how the respondents influence on their academic and non academic mean.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The choice of sampling method in selecting respondents depends on the research question, the population of interest, and the available resources. Common sampling methods include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and purposive sampling.</p><p>Yes, respondents are vital in a research study because they provide the data needed to answer the research questions. The selection of appropriate respondents can affect the validity and reliability of the study.</p><p>Yes, it is important to plan the procedures ahead of the actual gathering of data to ensure that the research is conducted efficiently and effectively. Planning can also help to identify potential problems and address them before they occur.</p><p>Researchers make their own research instrument after they have defined the research questions and objectives. They then select the appropriate method of data collection, design the instrument, and pilot test it to ensure that it is valid and reliable.</p><p>Before the research instrument is administered to the respondents, researchers should ensure that it is clear, easy to understand, and free of bias. They should also obtain ethical approval, select appropriate respondents, and decide on the method of administration (e.g. online, in-person, telephone).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Examples include the Morris Community Meal.</p><p></p><p>Community Education</p><p>Projects that provide instructional services or curricula, or serve to educate the public about a social issue (in a non-partisan way). Examples include the TREC program, Community ESL classes, and Gather in the Park.</p><p></p><p>Community Organizing</p><p>Projects that bring people together with the goal of solving a community issue. Please note that OCE cannot work on partisan issues, but can contribute to creating solutions for non-partisan, local issues. An example is assistance in establishing the Latino Parent Advisory Board for the local school.</p><p></p><p>Deliberative Dialogue</p><p>Projects that intentionally bring people together to build understanding across differences.</p><p></p><p>Direct Service</p><p>Projects that provide a service or product to an individual, group, or the community as a whole. Examples include filling a volunteer shift at a local organization, creating social media tools for an organization, or creating a community mural.</p><p></p><p>Economic Development</p><p>Projects that work on developing the regional economy in a sustainable way. Note that OCE does not partner with for-profit entities except when doing so would benefit the community as a whole and not the for-profit only organization. Examples include feasibility studies for new businesses and projects that attract people to small town business disricts.</p><p></p><p>Engaged Research</p><p>Research that directly benefits the community by clarifying the causes of a community challenge, mapping a community's assets, or contributing to solutions to current challenges and also fits a faculty member's research agenda. In the best case scenario, faculty with research expertise work alongside community members and students on such projects. An example would be the MIEI community needing assessment.</p><p></p><p>Institutional Engagement</p><p>University resources intentionally offered without undue barriers to the community. OCE can play a role in envisioning institutional engagement efforts. Examples include making Briggs library cards available for community members, making campus events accessible, and choosing to use local and sustainable businesses to supply services or goods.</p><p></p><p>Give 1 Example of Community Engagement and atleast 3 objectives</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Lack of standardization in the research process for distance education research. There are logistical issues surrounding the research process that need to be addressed. Oftentimes what seems like a streamlined process on paper does not necessarily pan out as such in actual implementation. DETA researchers expressed a top challenge for distance education research is translating the research plan into actual implementation at the designing stage, data collection stage, and analysis stage for distance education studies.
Incentivizing participation. Many distance education researchers face the obstacle of finding enough faculty and student participants to warrant a sound, evidence-based research project. Given the economic climate influencing many institutional resources, monetary incentives are unlikely, or the incentivization results in minimal participation. Thus, researchers face the difficulty of finding creative strategies for encouraging participation with limited resources.
Reliance on self-reported data. As with any research endeavor involving opinions and behaviors of humans, reliance on self-reported data means our data is ‘as good as the responses we ask for.’ The accuracy of self-reported data, without the availability of data for cross-checking, is unknown, which is a challenge in research conducted on student populations.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>I have accepted the fact that people who suffer from anxiety and depression will never be cured. Therapy is always there but I've never really seen it as an option probably because I live in the Philippines. However, I meet more and more people who have chosen to get help and so far, there are mixed opinions. The Philippines already has the Mental Health Act approved by the two houses of the senate which hopefully will be passed into law this year (2018). It's a clear indication that the country is moving towards making people aware of mental health and helping those who are in constant battle with mental health problems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

the variables of the study and construct a conceptual framework.
Research Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
Example of a Research 
Hypothesis
Question: Is there a significant 
relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
