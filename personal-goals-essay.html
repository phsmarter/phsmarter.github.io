Drafting a Descriptive Essay d. Revising a Descriptive Essay e. Editing a Descriptive Essay b. Publishing a Descriptive Essay c. Prewriting for the Descriptive Essay In the prewriting phase of descriptive essay writing, students should take time to think about who or what they want to describe and why. The topic doesn't have to be famous or unusual. The person could be a grandparent, an object, a favorite toy, a place, or a tree house. When creating the initial draft of a descriptive essay, follow the outline, but remember, the goal is to give the reader a rich experience of the subject. In the revision phase. students review, modify, and reorganize their work with the goal of making it the best it can be. In revising a descriptive essay, students should reread their work with these considerations in mind. At this point in the writing process, writers proofread and correct errors in grammar and mechanics. It's also the time to improve style and clarity. Watch out for clichés and loading up on adjectives and adverbs. Having a friend read the essay helps writers see trouble spots and edit with a fresh perspective. Sharing the descriptive essay with the rest of the class can be both exciting and a bit scary. Remember, there isn't a writer on earth who isn't sensitive about his or her own work. The important thing is to learn from the experience and take whatever feedback is given to make the next essay even better.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Have you at any point asked why certain individuals succeed and do well in specific circumstances while others don't? The explanation is that those effective individuals endlessly have consistently had a specific qualities that assist them with doing as such. These qualities are called temperances. A prudence is a quality of an individual which upholds individual moral greatness and aggregate prosperity. Perhaps of the main excellence that helps people progress and succeed is tolerance. This is on the grounds that persistence helps one use sound judgment, keeps one from surrendering, and creates sympathy and empathy. Tolerance, most importantly, assists us with using sound judgment. The justification for this is by showing restraint you have a reasonable brain to thoroughly consider the potential consequences of your activities. Everybody has pressure and has been in unpleasant circumstances yet the manner in which we answer the pressure characterizes our future achievement. To become effective individuals have needed to settle on difficult choices in regards to their fates and without persistence they could never have had the option to do as such. For instance Bill Doors, the most extravagant man on the planet, settled on the choice to exit school to seek after his fantasies about making a product organization. In its beginning phases he confronted a lot of misfortune for his choice however he stayed with it and his understanding assisted him with becoming one of the richest and best individuals of all time. Alongside dynamic tolerance additionally keeps one from surrendering. This is because of keeping your objectives predictable paying little mind to how troublesome or the time it takes to contact them. One of the best instances of accomplishment through tolerance Is Dr. Martin Luther Lord Jr. He is perhaps of the most persuasive individual that have at any point lived. Dr. Lord's objective which was basic yet appeared to be unimaginable at the time was to end segregation and bind together our country</p><br />

                        <p> "My Personal Financial Goals in Life"</p><p></p><p>Figuring out where you will be financially years from now is hard to imagine. There are always what you plan, and then there’s things that just happen that you would usually rather not have of. You can always make goals and things and hope that things go alright and end up close to what you expected. </p><p>I am currently eighteen years old. I am working on setting up all my financial things so that I am independent and can rely on myself for what I need and not have to worry about having my parents approving of things and being responsible for what I choose to do. I am going to take out a small loan soon and work on building up my credit history. I am also planning on transferring all my things like my car and phone to my name. This summer I…show more content…</p><p>I will then purchase my own house and also a car. I will be paying insurance on both of these items. I will work the rest of my life as a Nurse and will eventually retire at the age of 65.</p><p>Although I don’t really know how well all of this will work out and I’m sure there are probably easier ways to do all this, I don’t think I will be talking to any professionals. I think I have enough basic understanding in order to keep myself stable. Granted I will probably fall a couple of times and make a few mistakes, I’ve been taught to keep working at it and you’ll get it right eventually. I know that in order to get what you want you have to try and work really hard. I don’t believe in being handed things, whether it be money or advice or anything else. I would rather try and fail then have someone tell me what to and what not to do. </p><p> I myself believe in risks to an extent. I think they are alright as long as they are somewhat logical. I don’t believe in “jumping off a cliff with no ropes hoping to survive”. I plan on having two accounts, one checking and one savings. I will mainly work with my checking account and the savings will not be touched unless for emergencies. I will keep a minimum of a thousand dollars in my savings account, which I will be opening at a credit union since they have a slightly higher interest rate, so I will always have it. I have learned to always keep a “safe".</p><p></p><p></p><br />
