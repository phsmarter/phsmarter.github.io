When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon—stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology- we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future."

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> Put simply, the social sciences are important because they create better institutions and systems that affect people’s lives every day. Creating frameworks for understanding the origins and effects of regime type, the purpose of political parties, the reasons for polarization, the structure of social networks, the goals and structures of government agencies, or the challenges and opportunities faced by service providers and nonprofits are all attempts to make sense of structures that have real and profound on-the-ground impacts. While many social science disciplines are important in helping people to understand and engage with the wide variety of institutions that shape their lives, political science is particularly valuable in helping people learn to be citizens. Through participating in government at all levels, holding lawmakers accountable, and upholding democratic norms and values, individuals must have the resources to understand how government works and how laws and regulations are made; evaluate policies and outcomes based on effectiveness and values; make informed decisions about policy preferences; and, especially, understand the importance of participating in government, from voting to protesting. Political scientists are essential in providing these resources, in classrooms and in the public sphere.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong> </strong>Understanding Culture, Society, and Politics  uses multidisciplinal insights from anthropology, political science, and sociology to develop student awareness of cultural, social, and political dynamics and sensitivity to cultural diversity. It provides a deeper understanding of how culture, human agency, society, and politics work; and engage students in the examination of the country’s current human development goals. At the end of the course, students should acquire ideas about human cultures, human agency, society, and politics; recognize cultural relativism and social inclusiveness to overcome prejudices; and develop social and cultural competence to guide their interactions with groups, communities, networks, and institutions.</p><p></p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong> </strong>Put simply, the social sciences are important because they create better institutions and systems that affect people's lives every day. ... Thus, social sciences help people understand how to interact with the social world—how to influence policy, develop networks, increase government accountability, and promote democracy. </p><p></p><p><strong>4.</strong> The importance of understanding culture is that it helps you understand different cultures not just Filipino cultures but also other cultures. ... And understanding politics to helps you know one of the basic rights you have. It also tells you on what is happening on our government.</p><p></p><p><strong>5.</strong><strong> </strong>I’d make my own world into a world without violence or badness. A world where people can only feel happy. A world that looks brand new and designed as if it were the future. Making your world would only be possible if you could control people. If you could control them then they wouldn’t have free will and the place would just end up a reflection of your ego. It would become soliptic. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The science discoveries that are of any significance will not be used for mankind it will be used for profit and gain for men in control . There is no free will on earth to choose your destiny the paths are there and you must choose a path. These paths were made by a system not a God so why do we have to live in this created society of greed and personal profit ? Look how gypsies are treated for going against the grain of society ! Science will only benefit the corporation controlling us . So my answer it's shaped to fit it both ways by the controllers . Look at Werner braun Nazi scientist. Every Nazi was tried for war crimes . But this guy was given USA citenship and clemency . Why because he was not a nice person he developed missiles to strike cities .</p><p></p><br />

                            14. 1. 2 QUESTIONS How did society shape science and how did science shape society? How do social and h​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p><p>How did the society shape science and how did science shape the society?Society got together in numerous ways to assist establish science by investigating aneed that had not yet been identified. Science aided others in visualizing what is possible,allowing those who were unaware of the outcomes to develop more for unmet needs. Theyearning of society to comprehend the universe through the application of reason developed science. Meanwhile, science has shaped society by subordinating knowledge of the world tothat   which   can   be   identified   and   measured   while   disregarding   or   refusing   to   acceptthe knowledge of the world revealed by God. As a result, society has become less religiousand God-fearing, to the detriment of human values, particularly those concerning human lifeand the relevance of the family system as the basics of good living.2. How do social and human issues influence science?In the sense that social and human challenges may stimulate scientific investigationsaiming at addressing them, they have an impact on science. Society has a hand in decidinghow its resources are distributed to finance scientific study, favoring some and .   Similarly,   scientists   are   impacted   directly   by   societal   interests   and   needs,   andfrequently aim their research toward areas that will benefit society.3. How do the political and cultural landscapes of the society affect the development of scientific cultures, science activities and science literacy?The evolution of scientific culture, activities, and literacy is heavily influenced by thepolitical and cultural landscapes.The first  thing to  realize  is that  science  is essentially  a process  of  formulating a hypothesis, testing it, gathering data, comparing outcomes, and then repeating the process.Understanding about the world around us and how situations come is at the heart of thescientific process. The importance of tradition in culture and politics is the next point to consider.   Specifically,   most   societies,   whether   religious   or   not,   reject   independentinvestigation in favor of adherence. In conclusion, it is impossible to do science withoutposing questions.Religion and science are as polar opposites as oil and water. This is due to the factthat religion is based on faith, whereas science is based on facts. Faith is believing in theunseen truth or conviction in the absence of proof. It cannot be examined or tested if it is not visible. Any position or belief can be held on faith alone, with no further reason. As a result,any demand for evidence is dismissed as frivolous, if not outright hazardous to one's .4. Considering the current state of our society, do you think science literacy among people has contributed to the growth of our economy?</p><p>Scientific literacy enables people to explore for opportunities to improve the world rather than accept it as it is. Science literacy improves people's intelligence. People can accomplish clever things when they get smarter. Develop a more sophisticated economy, construct smart cities, and mitigate climate change in a less dogmatic manner. It is simpler to make judgments when things are laid down in factual, statistical, and historical facts since there is no need to speculate and presume that certain supernatural force is to responsible.5. How can science influence government policies?When a substantial majority of government authorities take science seriously, science can affect policy decisions. The government will then welcome scientists who are experts in all of the key fields to tell the government on what works and what doesn't when it comes to scientific data-driven policy.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yan lang po </p><br />
