I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The role of a GMRC teacher in assisting young people in exploring the influences of the family and other social institutions in the process of becoming the person they are now is crucial in providing them with an understanding of why they are the way they are. The family is the primary social institution where a child first experiences love, discipline, values, and beliefs. As such, it is necessary for young people to reflect on how their family and social surroundings have helped shape their identities. This requires the teacher to create an environment that promotes trust, openness, and critical thinking. </p><p></p><p>In exploring their family and social influences, the teacher must be careful not to pass judgment or impose their own values and beliefs on the students. Instead, they should encourage students to examine their own experiences and make their own conclusions. This can be done through various activities such as group discussions, journal writing, and reflective exercises. </p><p></p><p>In addition to exploring their familial and social influences, the teacher must also equip the students with life skills such as self-awareness, empathy, and conflict resolution. These skills will enable young people to navigate their relationships with others and make informed decisions in their lives. Ultimately, the role of the GMRC teacher is to empower young people to recognize their agency in shaping who they are and who they want to become. </p><p></p><p>2. When students display a lack of respect and courtesy for elders, it is important for the teacher to address the situation promptly and thoughtfully. The first step is to establish clear expectations for behavior in the classroom. This may involve setting rules and consequences for non-compliance. The teacher should also model respectful behavior towards the students and encourage them to do the same. </p><p></p><p>If a particular student continues to exhibit disrespectful behavior, the teacher should first speak with the student privately to understand the root of their behavior. It is possible that the student is dealing with personal issues that are impacting their behavior. In this case, the teacher should work with the student to identify support resources that can help address their issues. </p><p></p><p>If the student's behavior persists despite attempts to address it, the teacher may need to involve the student's parents or guardians. This can be done through a phone call or a meeting with the parents. The teacher should provide evidence of the behavior and their attempts to address it, and work collaboratively with the parents to find a solution. </p><p></p><p>In all cases, the teacher must remain calm and professional when addressing disrespectful behavior. They should avoid using punitive tactics and instead focus on creating a positive and supportive learning environment. </p><p></p><p>3. Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin; one cannot exist without the other. A right is a privilege granted to someone by law or social convention. It is something that everyone is entitled to regardless of their background or circumstances. Examples of rights are the right to education, freedom of speech, and the right to vote. </p><p></p><p>Responsibilities, on the other hand, are the duties and obligations that come with having certain rights. They are the actions that individuals must take to ensure that their rights are protected and that they do not infringe on the rights of others. For example, the responsibility of the right to education is to attend school, complete assignments, and respect teachers and fellow students. </p><p></p><p>Rights and responsibilities are interconnected because one cannot exercise their rights without taking responsibility for them, and vice versa. Failing to fulfill one's responsibilities can lead to the loss of rights, as seen in legal systems where criminals may lose their right to vote or own a firearm. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the relationship between rights and responsibilities is essential in promoting a just and equitable society. A society where individuals recognize and take responsibility for their rights promotes a culture of civic engagement and social responsibility.</p><br />

                            9. Answer the following questions about the selection “Braving Storms”.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p>The article is entitled "Braving Storms" because it talks about the resilience and courage of the people affected by Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines who faced and endured the devastating storm.The article says that Typhoon Yolanda would go down in history as one of the strongest and deadliest typhoons that hit the Philippines. It caused massive destruction, loss of lives, and displacement of people. I agree with this observation as Typhoon Yolanda was indeed a tragic event that left a significant impact on the Philippines and its people.The narrator's attitude toward the victims of the typhoon is sympathetic and compassionate. The narrator acknowledges the sufferings and difficulties that the victims faced and highlights their strength and resilience in facing the disaster.The narrator saw the disaster in a positive light because it brought out the best in people, particularly in terms of their courage, determination, and willingness to help others in need. Although such disasters do not happen every day, the narrator points out that people's response to adversity can be inspiring and uplifting.From the devastation caused by the typhoon, the narrator learned the importance of resilience, courage, and hope in facing difficult situations. The narrator also learned the value of empathy and compassion in understanding the plight of others and helping them to recover from the disaster.The school has a special role to play in the aftermath of a tragedy such as Typhoon Yolanda because it can provide support, comfort, and assistance to students, families, and communities affected by the disaster. Schools can also help in the recovery process by providing education, counseling, and other resources to help people rebuild their lives.Edward Said asserts that teachers have a critical role to play in society as they are responsible for imparting knowledge, values, and critical thinking skills to students. He argues that teachers should not just transmit information but also help students to develop their own ideas, perspectives, and understanding of the world. Teachers can also act as agents of change by promoting social justice, diversity, and equality in their classrooms and communities.<br />

                            14. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?
