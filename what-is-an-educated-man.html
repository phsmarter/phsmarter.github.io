Write your answer in your English notebook.The Educated Man and the PeasantOnce upon a time, there was a young man from Bucharest who had just finished university. He was proud of his knowledge and smarts, and so decided to leave the big city and make his way teaching peasants in the countryside. Immediately, he was met with difficulties. He found that people didn't take too kindly to beingconsidered more stup!d than he, for he was twenty-two and most of the people that he met weremuch older.If he was to teach them, he would have proved that he was smarter. Feeling confident of his powers, he made a wager with a peasant. If the peasant couldn't answer the educated man's question, then the peasant would have to hand over three Lei. The educated man chuckled to himself.The entire village gathered to witness the quiz. The educated man asked the first question, "What is the capital of England?" The peasant answered, "I don't know. I will give you three Lei." "London." The people gasped; they were impressed. The educated man pocketed the money and asked a second question, "What moves very fast but doesn't look Settearth." The educated man pocketed the money and asked a third question, "What goes up in the day and down at night?" The peasant answered, "I don't know. I will give you three Lei."The educated man had taken from the peasant a total of nine Lei. Now the peasant was poor, and his wife started to cry. However, at his turn, the peasant also wished to ask the educated man a question but if he could not answer it, he would have to hand over thousand Lei to the peasant. The educated man quickly agreed and thought to himself. "This surely a fool!""What goes in the morning with two legs, at noon with four legs and in the evening with six legs?" There was a long silence, and everyone was staring at the educated man. He searched his brain for a long time but to no avail.He did not know the answer and had a choice but to hand over five thousand Lei, which was everything he had. Afterwards, the educated man was curious and so asked, "So what goes in the morning with two legs, at noon with four and in the evening with six?" The peasant answered, "I don't know. I will give you three Lei."1. Give the setting and characters of story.Setting:Characters:2. Who was smarter, the educated man or the peasant? Why?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In order for us to fully understand why education is important, let us first define what is Education. It is the <strong>process</strong> of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. </p><p>Education as we know it today is to study from nursery to college or for some up to higher studies like doctors  or those with PhD. The process we have undergone is to study basic knowledge and skills from nursery to high-school, then study a field of our choice in college where we feel we most excelled. </p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT as we know from the start, because without education, we will not have a system where we would develop our skills and knowledge. Without it a lot of facts we know as of today will not be established. There will be  false doctors, false engineers,  false professions - there will be no credibility in all things as we know it. </p><p>For young people, going to school is a burden, but it is actually a privilege. If you want to survive the rest of your lifetime don't take your education for granted as a lot of less-fortunate kids are striving hard just to get to school and finish their studies. </p><p>Although it is true that the existing education system we know today is limiting some of our abilities, it is not a hindrance to develop ourselves to the best of our ability. Education is not just in the four corners of our schools but it is through learning and evaluating through our daily experiences - that is where we acquire skills and knowledge.</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/111828</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/743479</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The 3 Characteristics of an Educated Man</p><p>Man sitting with woman at bar having drink illustration.</p><p></p><p>What defines an educated man? The number of degrees he has? The size of his vocabulary? How many books he’s read?</p><p></p><p>The qualities that constitute an educated man can be argued over and debated. But I was really taken with the description I found in the book How to Live the Good Life by Commander Edward Whitehead (the Schweppes guy!). He said:</p><p></p><p>An educated man has been defined as one who can entertain himself, one who can entertain another, and one who can entertain a new idea.</p><p></p><p>Let’s take a look at each of these characteristics.</p><p></p><p>The Educated Man Can Entertain Himself </p><p>Only those who want everything done for them are bored. –Billy Graham</p><p></p><p>“I’m bored!” is the plaintive cry uttered by many a child idling away their summer vacation or fall break. They expect their parents to come up with an activity to cure this boredom (if your mom was like mine, she would always make a wry suggestion like, “How about cleaning up your room?”).</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, many men never outgrow this need to be entertained by others and don’t develop into self-starters. This is the man who puts his head down on the dinner table as people talk after eating (I’ve seen it), the college student who grouses his way through a class outing to the local museum, and the houseguest who comes to visit your fair city and has no idea what he’d like to do during his stay; he leaves all the planning to you.</p><p></p><p>The reason that children are perennially bored is not that there aren’t entertainment options available — they’re often surrounded by toys and games — but that they have such short attention spans. They play with one thing for a little bit and then another, and then don’t know what else to do. The educated man is able to lose himself in a task, a hobby, a conversation, or a book because he has developed his powers of focus and concentration.</p><br />

                            21. what are the vocabulary words in the the marks of an educated man third trait by Nicholas Murray Butler ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are many educated men on the face of the Earth while some are not so educated. In his essay “The Marks of an Educated Man”, Butler listed five traits of an educated man: correctness and precision in the mother tongue, gentle manners, power and habit of reflection, power of growth, and his possession of efficiency/power to do so. The definition of an educated man in Butler’s definition is indeed correct. You cannot say you met one educated man that lacks all 5 of the traits that he had listed above.</p><p></p><p>To begin with, I agree with Butler’s definition of an educated man because all the qualities that he listed are truly found in an educated man. The first trait that he had stated was correctness and precision in the mother tongue. What this basically means is that an educated man uses correct language and pronunciation in his speech on a day to day basis. In the text Butler states “When one hears English well spoken with pure diction, correct pronunciation and almost unconscious choice of the right words, he or she recognizes it at once.” (page 1, paragraph 2, lines 15-17). What Butler is saying is that if a man can speaks English clearly and properly, therefore he is educated. People of this generation cannot put a sentence together without using 2 negatives or a curse word after every word that they say. An educated man pronounces his word thoroughly and clearly so anyone and everyone can understand what they are saying.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>#</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><br />

Recorded history from long before the present era emphasizes that education must also develop character.

It must offer multiple opportunities for students to learn about, discuss and enact positive social behaviors. Student leadership and involvement are essential for character education to become a part of a student's beliefs and actions.</p><br />

He was proud of his knowledge and smarts, and so decided to leave the big city and make his way teaching peasants in the countryside. Immediately, he was met with difficulties. He found that people didn't take too kindly to beingconsidered more stup!d than he, for he was twenty-two and most of the people that he met weremuch older.If he was to teach them, he would have proved that he was smarter. Feeling confident of his powers, he made a wager with a peasant. If the peasant couldn't answer the educated man's question, then the peasant would have to hand over three Lei. The educated man chuckled to himself.The entire village gathered to witness the quiz. The educated man asked the first question, "What is the capital of England?" The peasant answered, "I don't know. I will give you three Lei." "London." The people gasped; they were impressed. The educated man pocketed the money and asked a second question, "What moves very fast but doesn't look Settearth." The educated man pocketed the money and asked a third question, "What goes up in the day and down at night?" The peasant answered, "I don't know. I will give you three Lei."The educated man had taken from the peasant a total of nine Lei. Now the peasant was poor, and his wife started to cry. However, at his turn, the peasant also wished to ask the educated man a question but if he could not answer it, he would have to hand over thousand Lei to the peasant. The educated man quickly agreed and thought to himself. "This surely a fool!""What goes in the morning with two legs, at noon with four legs and in the evening with six legs?" There was a long silence, and everyone was staring at the educated man. He searched his brain for a long time but to no avail.He did not know the answer and had a choice but to hand over five thousand Lei, which was everything he had. Afterwards, the educated man was curious and so asked, "So what goes in the morning with two legs, at noon with four and in the evening with six?" The peasant answered, "I don't know. I will give you three Lei."1. Give the setting and characters of story.Setting:Characters:2. Who was smarter, the educated man or the peasant? Why?​</h2><br />
