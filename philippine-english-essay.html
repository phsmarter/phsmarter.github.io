                                            dections: Using the following opinions of Japanese about the Philippines, create an essay comparing your own opinion about it. An example is given below. Own Opinion: The Filipinos are very good English speakers. The Philippines has beautiful beaches. Own Opinion I think not all Filipinos are good at speaking in English. Some of them find it hard to read or even comprehend the English language. Moreover, some have difficulty uttering English words fluently. On the other hand, the Philippines have great beaches which are good to spend vacations with to relax and enjoy the summer breeze. Not only one place here has scenic places but every province or city has an ocean which can represent the beauty of it. Begin Here: Opinion 1. They open the door when you get in the cab which is very difficult for a Japanese person to do. 2. Filipinos sing a lot while they are working, and they are very good singers. 3. Filipinos are cheerful and friendly. 4. Women in the Philippines are energetic and can do a lot of things. 5. Fruits in the Philippines are delicious.​</a>

                                            Students graduating from Senior High School are not ready for college or for work. Data from JobStreet.com reveal that as much as 35% were flatly unwilling to hire SHS graduates, while 41% were unsure of it. 1. Many Filipino students cannot write well, especially in English. They often have errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 2. An article by the think tank Philippine Institute for Developrnent Studies (PIDS) on Monday, April 20, said SHS difficulty in writing in English was particularly evident in research projects. 3. Most students have big problems in using different punctuation marks. The learning and teaching report showed that incorrect punctuation caused the most problems for students in conveying meaning in their essay writing (Department of Student Services, 2013, p. 23). 4. To convey meaning, students must punctuate their work correctly. This is very important in writing. Students should always remember this. 5. I believe that the current curriculum in English is not working well for the Filipino learners. Instead of helping them improve their English skills, they are becoming worse.​</a>

                        <p>The United States and the Philippines have a strong trade and investment relationship, with over $27 billion in goods and services traded (2086). The United States is one of the largest foreign investors in the Philippines, and is the Philippines' third-largest trading partner. The United States and the Philippines are treaty allies under the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951. The Philippines is the oldest security ally of the US in Southeast Asia and one of the five treaty allies of the US in the Pacific region. The relationship between the United States and the Philippines has historically been strong and has been described as a special relationship. The Philippines is one of the oldest Asian partners of the United States and a strategically major non-NATO ally.</p><p></p><p>4 Main Reasons Why Filipinos Speak English So Well. First and most important reason: The American influence on the education system. They introduced a free education system and even sent teachers from America to help spread the language and made all teachers speak English in school. Philippine English is a legitimate nativized variety of English. While it shares some of the linguistic properties ascribed to other varieties of English, especially those used in Asia, it has features that are unique to it.</p><p></p><p>Enhancing the teaching of English in the Philippines presents opportunities for the country in the area of tourism. Rosario Alonzo, Dean of the University of the Philippines College of Education, says that the College ensures this by emphasizing to its students that English is a skill to be used for communication. Education became a very important issue for the United States colonial government, since it allowed it to spread their cultural values, particularly the English language, to the Filipino people. Instruction in English language, and American history, lead to forming of a national identity and Filipino nationalism.</p><p></p><p>From Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English strong accent the way that someone pronounces words that shows clearly that they come from a particular area or country a strong German accent → strongExamples from the Corpusstrong accent • Not merely that, I was putting my strongest accent on the syllable that wasn't! A dialect is generally a particular form of a language which is specific to a region or social group and usually has differences in pronunciation, grammar, syntax and vocabulary. It's still a bit fuzzy to understand because dialects can be spoken by people living in one particular town or by a whole nation. English is the most influential in the world by far, making one of the most important languages.</p><p></p><p>English is very important in the Philippines and it is the international language all over the world. At present English is the most useful language in the Philippines. From the education, industries, business, employment, and everyday life of Filipino it is very common to speak English to people.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>In the Philippines, "bayanihan" refers to a tradition of community and cooperation where neighbors come together to help someone in need. This tradition is deeply embedded in Filipino culture and is often demonstrated during disasters, when people work together to rebuild communities and help those affected. Bayanihan is also reflected in everyday life, where people help each other with small things like shopping or sharing food. This Bayanihan spirit reflects the unified nature of Filipino society and is a source of pride for many Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of Filipino culture is the celebration of festivals, or "fiestas." These festivals are usually held in honor of a patron saint and include parades, processions, street parties, and other forms of celebration. They are an opportunity for people to come together, celebrate their culture, and showcase their unique traditions and customs. Fiestas are an expression of the Filipinos' zest for life and joy and testify to their resilience and optimism, even in the face of adversity. The most famous of these festivals is the Ati-Atihan Festival in Aklan, known for its colorful costumes, lively music, and boisterous dancing.</p><p></p><p>Essay yan:⁠^⁠)^⁠_⁠^</p><br />

                        <p>When the United States ceased their Philippine colonization, they did not only leave the legacy of basketball, burgers, and, Hollywood movies. They left us a universal language, which is English.</p><p></p><p>Personally learning the language made it possible to read American classics, British tales, and, other kinds of foreign literature. Plus, it gave me confidence that I could easily communicate with other nationalities from online chatting to vacationing and studying abroad. In short, I feel English has provided me the opportunity to access a global buffet of ideas and potential foreign friendships.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it is highly valued to the point that it has become a medium of learning instruction and communication alongside Filipino. In addition to that, it created Taglish, the combination of Tagalog and English. I often hear this variation whenever I visit NCR, particularly, in the areas of Taguig and Makati. In these places, there are more well-off people, and, you can find international citizens in the locale.</p><p></p><p> Moreover, I noticed that there is a common connotation with speaking Taglish, which means a person is sosyal or associated with being rich and well-educated. This could equally mean that English fluency represents class and education. This is alarming yet no surprise for me. After all, the colonial mentality is strong in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the fact that English could threaten our Filipino pride, I believe that is key to achieving globalization because you cannot speak Tagalog in international diplomatic talks. You cannot woo investors with Cebuano or study abroad with only Hiligaynon in mind. You cannot order food in Ilocano when you're vacationing in France. In other words, we can vocally make our presence worldwide. </p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, as we speak in American slang, we must not forget to keep the Filipino pride burning through our dialects and traditions.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Vaccines approved by competent national regulatory authorities are very safe. As with all medicines, side effects can occur after getting a vaccine. However, these are usually very minor and of short duration, such as a sore arm or a mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a disease than by a vaccine.WHO works closely with national authorities to ensure that global standards are developed and made readily available to assess the quality, safety and immunogenicity of biological products including vaccines</p><br />

                            30. Students graduating from Senior High School are not ready for college or for work. Data from JobStreet.com reveal that as much as 35% were flatly unwilling to hire SHS graduates, while 41% were unsure of it. 1. Many Filipino students cannot write well, especially in English. They often have errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 2. An article by the think tank Philippine Institute for Developrnent Studies (PIDS) on Monday, April 20, said SHS difficulty in writing in English was particularly evident in research projects. 3. Most students have big problems in using different punctuation marks. The learning and teaching report showed that incorrect punctuation caused the most problems for students in conveying meaning in their essay writing (Department of Student Services, 2013, p. 23). 4. To convey meaning, students must punctuate their work correctly. This is very important in writing. Students should always remember this. 5. I believe that the current curriculum in English is not working well for the Filipino learners. Instead of helping them improve their English skills, they are becoming worse.​</h2><br />
