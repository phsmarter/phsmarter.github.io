                         It is all an illusion of temporary experience. there is nothing to identify, just simply detach from the idea that its real.<br /><br />That is the purpose of the spiritual path.. to let go of being outwardly focused and realize that it is the self, the consciousness underneath materiality that is real and so controls the outward manifestation.<br /><br />So the mind will inevitably wonder.. “we control the outward… to what degree?” and so enters the many imaginings, of the extent we would want to control it… and so we think of the various stories of walking on water, the powers of the gods and communication with higher beings.<br /><br />Whether or not these are true, is irrelevant to one who has yet to gain control over himself. Because we will never attain the power that many think awaits them in a heaven or on some other plane of existence, if we can't even control our own fear and selfishness. Because the truth here is it's that, that IS the force behind all things termed “evil".<br /><br />In truth there is no true evil, no satan, only ignorance and negatively focused minds, that conjures these things, subsequently giving up his/her power to overcome them through recognition of their own inequities and imbalances.<br /><br />So how do we overcome..THEM?<br /><br />First by detaching from the idea that you are the mind and body. And so enters.. Meditation, as this allows us the space to observe the mind more objectively, as we will see how the mind has its various inclinations and tendencies come up spontaneously.<br /><br />Then as our practice advances we will see the illusory nature of mind and their various prompts, by simply not engaging with them. We feed our thoughts with the power of our consciousness, while if we let them simply fall away, we create a weakness in their cyclical or karmic momentum. As this progresses they eventually die out or become so feint we barely notice them.<br /><br />The minds job IS.. to gather, organize and absorb information, as a servant of our consciousness, NOT to be who we are. This is the unfortunate mistake the majority of humanity has been living under for the past few millennia.<br /><br />But we are all slowly realizing person by person, that we are not the mind and who we really are, is the consciousness beneath it all. And so it this momentum of learned unconscious behavior, of culture, religion and self identification, that this substitute identity has seen fit to incorporate.<br /><br />As a result of this wrongly positioned focus we assumed erroneously that outside pleasure and acquisitions were a path to “gaining" the peace we all seek.<br /><br />So we chase after the pleasure, and the power, and the status and the abundance and the…blah blah ad nauseam.. until eventually we get sick of it, thus seeing that there is no true satisfaction in them, and to believe so, ONLY leads to pain.<br /><br />As we let go of the little self, that thinks things of a material nature are “the happiness”, we begin to raise our awareness to its actual source… the self, the soul, our God seed of consciousness.. that is where all joy, all love, all inspiration all creativity comes from as the infinite well of pure beingness.<br /><br />So this letting go and subsequent seeking inwardly..is the spiritual path.<br />

4.Of the servants in the Gospel, whom do you identify yourself with? The one given with five talents? With two? Or with one? Why?
5.Each one of us is given talents by God. What are your talents? How will you serve others with your talents?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong>4. Every one of us has been blessed with God-given talents. And yes, that absolutely includes you. You don’t have to take our word for it either—the Bible clearly spells it out in the first half of Romans 12:6 (NLT), which says, “In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well.” That’s a promise we can take to the bank!But even though we know God has blessed us with certain talents, using your God-given talents can still be a challenge. It can be difficult to know where you can put your gifts to use, and sometimes it’s hard to know what exactly your talents are.So, if you’re struggling with either of those things, here are some tips for using your God-given talents and figuring out what they are in the first place.</strong></p><p><br /><br />5. While it might seem simple to say talents can help others, actually identifying your talents and putting them to good use can be a little bit more difficult. So, what does using your talents really look like in action? Let’s explore how you can use your talents to help others in your community.</p><p>1. Consider what you’re good at.The first step in using your talents is truthfully considering what they are. This might seem simple enough, but can sometimes feel awkward to “brag” about yourself. Nevertheless, take some time to genuinely consider your strengths.Maybe you think about your qualities and characteristics, such as positivity, or actual skills, like graphic design, or even experiences you’ve had in the past, such as working with children. Consider what your talents are in a variety of areas, and then start to think about how you can use those talents in your community.</p><p>2. Think about what you enjoy.Along with your talents comes things you genuinely enjoy. You might be very talented at something, but maybe don’t enjoy it very much. For instance, perhaps you’re a great teacher, but don’t love working with children. Or, you might reallyenjoy something, but might not be very talented at it. While this can be challenging at first, having a genuine passion for something can also help grow your skills in that area. Think about things you enjoy doing, causes you feel passionate about or types of people you like working with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps po…</p><br />
