                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                                            Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</a>

                            6. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent. Giving respect to others is a way of exercising and multiplying our quality of respect, which will inevitably earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, giving respect to all individuals is crucial, and it is an innate quality that we possess. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others, and it helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others. By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

                            8. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                        <p><strong>Three Things you need to remember during debate</strong></p><p>Debate competition may be tricky for some reasons. Sometimes we feel certain motions can be undebatable since we are not in the favour side of the house and it makes us less engage to the debate. Somehow, the debaters need to be actively engaged during the debate so the adjudicator can credit them more. These three things will help you win the debate even when you are not really knowing how the motion supposedly works.</p><p>During the debate, first, make sure that you and your team fulfill the speakers’ role. In Asian Parliamentary debate, there are 3 speakers which have various crucial responsibilities which need to be fulfilled. As the first speaker, we really need to settle the definition of the motion by contextualizing the real problem of the motion. Defining motion based on a dictionary won’t help the adjudicator know what your team’s stance on the debate is. As a second speaker, giving rebuttal will help the team a lot because it means your team can engage actively in the debate. Third speaker will need more cases or examples of the case to extend the whole team argument. Second of all, giving responses through POI (Point of Information) actively will make the adjudicator think that your team can contribute actively to the debate. Last but not least, construct your argument based on AREL (Assertion, Reasoning, Evidence, Linkback) structure. By having a clear segment on the argument, it makes it easier in delivering the argument, on the other hand it will help the adjudicator to write down your argument easily.</p><p>Fulfilling the speaker's role, actively engaging the debate through POI, and constructing arguments with AREL structure are basic things for debaters which shouldn’t be ignored in every debate round. Winning or losing may happen in a competition, but if you remember these three things during debate it will help increase the winning probability. </p><p></p><p><strong>Further Explanation:<br /></strong>A. First Paragraph must be the <strong>introduction</strong> paragraph. We can start it by write the background or the basic problem of things that we want to write in the essay which usually called as a hook. Hook can be something compelling such as a question, a powerful quote, or an interesting fact. After that, we need to put the thesis statements which usually located at the end of the first paragraph. <br /><br /><strong>Hook:</strong> Debate competition may be tricky for some reasons.</p><p><strong>Background Points:</strong></p><p>- In what way we can say that debate is tricky<br />- What is the harm</p><p><strong>Thesis Statement:</strong> These three things will help you win the debate even when you are not really knowing how the motion supposedly works.</p><p><br />B. Second paragraph is the <strong>body</strong>. Create a topic sentence for this body paragraph that communicates this and also transitions from the introduction into the body. Since the thesis statements mentioning about three things, we need to make sure every single things marked by word or phrases like first, second, finally, last but not least, etc. It makes the reader easier in identifying the point of the essay. Make sure each point has their own supporting sentences.<br /><br />C. As with most <strong>conclusion</strong> paragraphs, this paragraph ought to restate the thesis in different words.<br /><br /><strong>Learn more about short essay</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/26062292</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/65542</p><p><strong> <br />#SPJ1</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nationalism, the deep love and devotion for one's country, is an essential aspect of building a strong and united nation. It fuels a sense of belonging, ignites patriotic fervor, and drives individuals to contribute positively to their society. In this narrative essay, I aim to explore the significance of nationalism and share personal experiences that have shaped my love for my country. Moreover, I hope to inspire fellow students to embrace nationalism and actively demonstrate their support for our nation</p><p></p><p>My journey towards embracing nationalism began with a deep exploration of my country's history, culture, and heritage. I delved into the stories of our heroes, their sacrifices, and their unwavering dedication to the betterment of our nation. Through books, documentaries, and conversations with older generations, I developed a profound understanding of the struggles our ancestors endured to secure our freedom and independence. In a nation as diverse as ours, celebrating and embracing cultural diversity is a powerful expression of nationalism. I actively participated in cultural festivals, wearing traditional attire, learning traditional dances, and indulging in regional cuisines. These experiences not only fostered a sense of appreciation for our diverse heritage but also promoted unity among different communities, transcending any differences and forging a shared identity.</p><p></p><p>Let us stand together, young and passionate, as we encourage one another to love this nation, to strive for its progress, and to uphold the values that define us. In doing so, we pave the way for a brighter future, a future where our love for our country knows no bounds.</p><br />

In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</h2><br />

Why are schools still not ready to accept students?</p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has surprisingly changed the way people live and work.

We spent the rest of the night talking and laughing, and I knew that this was the beginning of something special.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events:</p><p></p><p>Over the next few months, our relationship blossomed. We went on adventures together, explored new places, and spent countless hours getting to know each other. We were inseparable, and I couldn't imagine my life without him.</p><p></p><p>But then, one day, everything changed. I received a job offer in another state, and I knew that I had to take it. We talked about it and decided that we would make it work, even though we would be long distance. But as the days went by, the distance between us seemed to grow. We started to drift apart, and eventually, we decided to break up.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story:</p><p></p><p>I moved away and started my new job, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. I tried to move on and focus on my career, but I couldn't help but think about what could have been. I often found myself wondering, "What if we had never met?"</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In the end, I realized that our relationship was just one of many possible paths that my life could have taken. But even though things didn't work out between us, I will always be grateful for the time we spent together. Our relationship may have been brief, but it was filled with love, laughter, and countless memories. And who knows, maybe one day our paths will cross again and we can pick up where we left off. Until then, I will always cherish the time we had together.</p><p></p><p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: The Power of Education: A What-If Scenario</p><p></p><p>Introduction: Education has always been a crucial aspect of human life. It has the power to shape our minds, broaden our horizons, and open up opportunities for us. But what if we did not have access to education? How would our lives be different? This is the question we aim to explore in this narrative essay.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story: Imagine a world where education was not considered important. Children were not encouraged to go to school, and those who did were often ridiculed for their efforts. In this world, the pursuit of knowledge was seen as a waste of time and resources.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events: As a result of this lack of emphasis on education, many people struggled to find jobs and make a decent living. They were trapped in a cycle of poverty and had little hope of breaking free. Those who did manage to secure jobs often had to settle for low-paying, unskilled positions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, without access to education, many people were unable to learn the skills needed to adapt to a rapidly changing world. As technology advanced, they were left behind, unable to compete in the job market or even keep up with the world around them.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story: Eventually, the lack of education began to take a toll on society. Crime rates increased, and people became more isolated and unhappy. The economy struggled, and the overall quality of life declined. It was clear that the absence of education had severely impacted the world in a negative way.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, education is a powerful tool that has the ability to shape our lives for the better. Without it, we would be unable to compete in a rapidly changing world and would be more likely to face poverty, isolation, and unhappiness. It is crucial that we prioritize education and provide access to it for all individuals.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Greetings, mortal.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>God created the world with love and devotion. As stated in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting eternal life.” God love is so strong for his saints that he made sacrifices for us be a part of this world that he created. Christians should love the environment and its preservation and anyone who doesn’t the love of the father is not in him. As God created plants, and animals he also created humans to take care of the environment that he love so dearly. The action that God want Christians to express is love, compassion, and kindness regarding the environment and its preservation. Throughout this essay I will provide adequate quotes from the Bible and research to convince Christians of the appropriate actions that should be taken regarding the environment and its preservation. God announces his love for the environment several times in the Old Testament. As stated in Deuteronomy 7:13-14 “and he will love and bless you and multiply you he will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land the …show more content…</p><p>In Isaiah 5:8-10 the Lord judges those who misused the land. Tress may be cut down to build houses or to make a fire for heat. Everything that God created is resourceful and it’s for a purpose however, we should limit ourselves to what God provided in order to protect the environment. Most worldviews and religions have made the environment not a big enough issue and do not get involved. Not taking over the environment is a way of letting the enemy win and get what he came to destroy</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kau na bahala magpili kung hanngang saan yung kaya nyong sagutan</p><br />
