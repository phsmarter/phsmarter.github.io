Definition of a System A set of interconnected components that are interacting to form a unified whole. 2. The Earth system is essentially a closed system. It receives energy from the sun and returns some of this energy to space.3. Atmosphere.A. The atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. B. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O2), 0.9% argon, and trace amount of other gases. C. One of the most important processes by which the heat on the Earth's surface is redistributed is through atmospheric circulation. D. There is also a constant exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and thehydrosphere through the hydrologic cycle.4. Lithosphere. A. The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</a>

Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</a>

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

Need help pasagot po due today na kasi eh matinong sagot po sana nonsense reported, if di po alam wag nalang sumagot sayang po kasi yung points :&lt;DIRECTION: Read the text below and answer the questions that follow.SMART READINGStudents begin to read at an early age. By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</h2><br />

                            9. What I Need to Know Taking an order is a very skillful art which reflects efficiency and standard of both warter and establishment. Every food and Beverage Service Staff should have good command over order taking to ensure that each guest gets proper food that he ordered and served in right sequence. Each establishment has a specific protocol for taking orders from the table forwarding it to the kitchen and assembly areas. A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. A food server must be familiar about the dishes that are listed on the menu. Objectives: At the end of the lesson, you are expected to: A. classify the different types of menu; B. create your own menu; and C. perform order taking.​</h2><br />
