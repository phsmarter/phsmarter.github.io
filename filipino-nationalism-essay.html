                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> THE BEGINNING OF FILIPINO NATIONALISM</p><p>             Nationalism had been greatly affected by factors that made the Filipinos as helpless and voiceless against their colonizers. These factors are:</p><p>             1.	Lack of Unity among Filipinos due to:</p><p>             •	Divided barangays with their respective chieftains</p><p>             •	The domination and control of Christianity as a religion introduced by the Spaniards. This despite the prevailing religion of the Muslim Filipinos.</p><p>             •	The policy of "divide and rule" of the Spanish government.</p><p>             •	On-going suppression of revolts from other Filipino provinces.</p><p>             •	Lack and poor means of communication among Filipinos</p><p>             2.	The discriminating and unfair educational system established by the Spaniards. This system had aggravated the call for Filipino nationalism as explained below:</p><p>             A.	Almost all colleges and universities founded by the Spaniards were made exclusive only to Spaniards and Spanish mestizos. The doors were closed to Filipinos</p><p>             B.	In most cases, Filipinos got their education from their parents and mostly confined at home.</p><p>             C.	When at the latter part, the schools were opened to Filipinos their treatment from the teachers (Spaniards) were unfair, cruel punishments were made and the methods of teaching were improper.</p><p>             D.	There were more colleges for women opened but only cater to Spanish women.</p><p>             While in the second half of the 19th Century, universities like the University of Sto. Tomas opened its doors to Filipinos yet only affluent Filipino families can afford to enroll their children in school. Though later on, some nationalist Filipinos began their search for fairness, justice and initiated moves towards Filipino Nationalism.</p><p>             Filipino Nationalism thereafter, in the early Spanish regime is unheard, unfelt and a thing of subservience by the Filipinos to their cruel masters of tyranny and oppression.</p><br />

                            2. Filipino Nationalism essay (8 sentences)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipino nationalism refers to the establishment and support of a political identity associated with the modern nation-state of the Philippines, leading to a wide-ranging campaign for political, social, and economic freedom in the Philippines. This gradually emerged from various political and armed movements throughout most of the Spanish East Indies—but which has long been fragmented and inconsistent with contemporary definitions of such nationalism—as a consequence of more than three centuries of Spanish rule. These movements are characterized by the upsurge of anti-colonialist sentiments and ideals which peaked in the late 19th century led mostly by the ilustrado or landed, educated elites, whether peninsulares, insulares, or native (Indio). This served as the backbone of the first nationalist revolution in Asia, the Philippine Revolution of 1896.[1] The modern concept would later be fully actualized upon the inception of a Philippine state with its contemporary borders after being granted independence by the United States by the 1946 Treaty of Manila.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hi friend here's  my answer  sana nakatulong  ako sau and please parate thanks</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The development of Filipino nationalism traces back to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines. During this time, Filipinos were forced to adopt the Spanish culture and religion, and were denied basic human rights. The Spanish regime treated the Filipinos as second-class citizens, and only allowed them to hold lower positions in the government.</p><p></p><p>As a result, a group of educated Filipinos called the Ilustrados emerged, and began to challenge the Spanish authority by advocating for reforms and social justice. The Ilustrados were composed of prominent intellectuals, writers, and activists who used their skills and talents to rally the Filipinos towards nationalism.</p><p></p><p>The rise of the Ilustrados paved the way for the emergence of other nationalist movements, such as the Propaganda Movement and the Katipunan. The Propaganda Movement, led by Jose Rizal, sought to promote national consciousness and national identity among the Filipinos through education, enlightenment, and reform. Meanwhile, the Katipunan, led by Andres Bonifacio, aimed to achieve Philippine independence through armed revolution.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Revolution against Spain began in 1896 and led to the proclamation of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898. However, the Filipinos' struggle for independence did not end there, as they faced a new colonizer in the form of the United States.</p><p></p><p>The Filipino-American War broke out in 1899 and lasted for three years. Despite their valiant efforts, the Filipinos were defeated by the Americans, and the Philippines became a colony of the United States.</p><p></p><p>Despite this setback, the Filipinos continued to fight for their freedom and independence. The nationalist movement gained momentum during the American period, with prominent figures such as Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osmeña leading the charge for Philippine independence.</p><p></p><p>Finally, on July 4, 1946, the Philippines was granted independence by the United States, marking the culmination of the Filipinos' struggle for freedom and self-determination.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the development of Filipino nationalism was a long and arduous process that spanned several centuries. It was fueled by the desire of the Filipinos to assert their identity, dignity, and sovereignty in the face of foreign oppression and exploitation. Today, Filipino nationalism remains an important aspect of Philippine culture and history, and serves as a reminder of the Filipinos' enduring spirit and resilience.</p><br />

The French Revolution was a time of great change and upheaval in France, and it led to the rise of a new political system called liberalism. Liberalism is a political philosophy that believes in the rights of the individual, and it was very influential in the development of nationalism.</p><p></p><p>The French Revolution also had a significant impact on the development of Philippine nationalism. One of the main reasons why Philippine nationalism developed in the 19th century was because of the French connection. The Philippines was a Spanish colony until 1898, and during that time, the Spanish government was very influential in the development of Philippine nationalism. The Spanish government promoted the idea of Filipino nationalism, and it helped to create a sense of national identity among the Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>The French connection also had a negative impact on Philippine nationalism. The French connection led to the spread of French culture and language in the Philippines, and this had a negative impact on the development of Filipino culture. French culture and language were seen as symbols of colonial domination, and this led to the growth of anti-French sentiment in the Philippines.</p><br />

It is also a part of inclusivity which is an emerging issue in today's society after studies show that an inclusive community means there are <strong>fewer inequalities</strong> which translates to a <strong>progressive nation. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Learn more about The Filipino Way here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2590627</p><p>#SPJ1</p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                            30. Reflect and write a critical essay on the development happened during the 19th century in connection to Filipino nationalism.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The 19th century was a significant time in the Philippines as it marked the beginning of the development of Filipino nationalism. During this era, educated Filipinos known as the Ilustrados, who were mostly from wealthy families, played a major role in the cultural and political awakening of the country. They were influenced by the European Enlightenment and aimed to create a fairer and just society. They used their education and influence to push for reforms and challenge the existing system.</p><p></p><p>Journalism also grew during this time and the Ilustrados utilized it to spread their ideas and push for change. They established newspapers and magazines that covered a variety of subjects, from politics and social justice to science and culture, helping to foster a sense of national identity among Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>The 19th century also saw the rise of secret societies that sought to overthrow Spanish rule and promote Philippine independence. The most notable of these groups was the Kataastaasan Kagalang-galang na Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan, which used its resources and connections to launch the Philippine Revolution in 1896. This revolution was a crucial event in Philippine history and demonstrated the growing nationalism among Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Philippine art and culture flourished during the 19th century. Artists and the Ilustrados used their creativity to showcase their national pride and cultural identity through their works, contributing to the growth of Philippine culture and creating a sense of pride among Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the 19th century was instrumental in shaping Filipino nationalism. The growth of the Ilustrado class, the expansion of journalism, the emergence of secret societies, and the development of Philippine art and culture all played a part in the cultural and political awakening of the Philippines and set the stage for the country's eventual independence.</p><p></p><p>1.
