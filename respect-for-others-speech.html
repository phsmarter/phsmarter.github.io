Second, develop a sense of commitment to the Philippines. Commitment means much more than just standing up to the national anthem. It means contributing something to the progress and development of the Philippines no matter how small it is. It means doing your work faithfully and well. It also means upholding the ideals and heritage of the Filipino nation. Third, respect each other and work well with each other. You are going to be leaders of this country and you are here as individuals sincerely trying to develop yourselves, commit yourselves to the Philippines, and uphold the ideals of freedom and democracy. As good leaders, you should be able to think for yourselves, and stand on your own feet. Be responsible, honest, hardworking, patriotic, and just."

Directions: Read the following speech and then answer the given questions below
"If you are going to be leaders, there are three important things to do. First, really know yourselves and what is going on in our country. In spite of differences, you all belong to one nation. Second, develop a sense of commitment to the Philippines. Commitment means much more than just standing up to the national anthem. It means contributing something to the progress and development of the Philippines no matter how small it is. It means doing your work faithfully and well. It also means upholding the ideals and heritage of the Filipino nation. Third, respect each other and work well with each other. You are going to be leaders of this country and you are here as individuals sincerely trying to develop yourselves, commit yourselves to the Philippines, and uphold the ideals of freedom and democracy. As good leaders, you should be able to think for yourselves, and stand on your own feet. Be responsible, honest, hardworking, patriotic, and just."
