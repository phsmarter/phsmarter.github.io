                                            Learning Task 2: Read and understand. "Do not answer this part" Here are the guidelines that you can use to improve the overall composition of our images. 1.Simplification. The easiest way to have a clear and strong composition is to keep things simple. Instead, oh having too much going on in the frame, keep the focus on a single subject 2.Rule of Thirds-this basic composition technique is based on the idea that placing your subject off-center yields a stronger, more natural-looking composition. Following this also serves as the perfect opportunity to shoot your subjects from different angle 3. Framing - it involves using or adding frame elements to emphasize and lead the viewer's eye towards your subject or to simply add interest to your image. 4) Leading Lines and Shapes - Road, bridges and even hallways are great for showing linear perspective. They have lines that become narrow standards the far end, potentially leading the eyes to where your main subjects may be. 5. Contrast - this can be used to make your subject stand out. It is simply surrounding the subject and fill the frame with lighter colors Remember: Photo essay is intended to tell a story or evoke emotion from the viewers through a series of photographs. They allow you to be more creative and fully explore an idea. Day in Life Photo Essay-one of the examples of photo essay. In this example, your narative focuses on specific subject for an entire day. A great way to understand what people get up to in their day-to-day is to follow them and photograph as you go.​</a>

But what were the lasting effects of the Trojan's downfall? This essay will explore the various effects of the Trojan War on the people, society and culture of ancient Greece and Troy."</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph:</p><p>The Trojan War had a significant impact on the people and society of ancient Greece. One of the most notable effects was the loss of life, as many soldiers from both sides were killed in battle. This resulted in a decrease in population and a loss of skilled labor, which had a negative effect on the economy. Additionally, many cities and towns were destroyed during the war, leaving many people homeless and in poverty.</p><p></p><p>Another effect of the Trojan War was the cultural impact on the people of ancient Greece. The war was a defining moment in Greek history and had a lasting impact on the culture and society. The stories and myths surrounding the Trojan War were passed down through generations and were a major part of Greek literature and art. The Trojan War also had a profound effect on the Greek religion, as many gods and goddesses were said to have been involved in the conflict.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The Trojan War was a devastating event that had far-reaching consequences for the people and society of ancient Greece and Troy. The loss of life, destruction of cities, and cultural impact all contributed to the long-term effects of the Trojan's downfall. While the Trojan War was a defining moment in ancient history, it serves as a reminder of the destructive nature of war and its lasting impact on people and culture</p><br />

                            23. Learning Task 2: Read and understand. "Do not answer this part" Here are the guidelines that you can use to improve the overall composition of our images. 1.Simplification. The easiest way to have a clear and strong composition is to keep things simple. Instead, oh having too much going on in the frame, keep the focus on a single subject 2.Rule of Thirds-this basic composition technique is based on the idea that placing your subject off-center yields a stronger, more natural-looking composition. Following this also serves as the perfect opportunity to shoot your subjects from different angle 3. Framing - it involves using or adding frame elements to emphasize and lead the viewer's eye towards your subject or to simply add interest to your image. 4) Leading Lines and Shapes - Road, bridges and even hallways are great for showing linear perspective. They have lines that become narrow standards the far end, potentially leading the eyes to where your main subjects may be. 5. Contrast - this can be used to make your subject stand out. It is simply surrounding the subject and fill the frame with lighter colors Remember: Photo essay is intended to tell a story or evoke emotion from the viewers through a series of photographs. They allow you to be more creative and fully explore an idea. Day in Life Photo Essay-one of the examples of photo essay. In this example, your narative focuses on specific subject for an entire day. A great way to understand what people get up to in their day-to-day is to follow them and photograph as you go.​</h2><br />
