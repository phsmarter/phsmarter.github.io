This study uses a social cost and benefit analysis. The main benefits came from IPPs, which contributed to resolving the crisis and promoted economic and social development. Consumers and investors are net gainers, while the government lost and an air pollution cost was incurred. The paper concludes that reform with private sector participation increased social welfare.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            7. Discuss the key Japanese officers during the invasion and how the Philippines was liberated.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: The Japanese occupation of the Philippines (Filipino: Pananakop ng mga Hapones sa Pilipinas; Japanese: 日本のフィリピン占領; Hepburn: Nihon no Firipin Senryō) occurred between 1942 and 1945, when Imperial Japan occupied the Commonwealth of the Philippines during World War II.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The invasion of the Philippines started on 8 December 1941, ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. As at Pearl Harbor, American aircraft were severely damaged in the initial Japanese attack. Lacking air cover, the American Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines withdrew to Java on 12 December 1941. General Douglas MacArthur was ordered out, leaving his men at Corregidor on the night of 11 March 1942 for Australia, 4,000 km away. The 76,000 starving and sick American and Filipino defenders in Bataan surrendered on 9 April 1942, and were forced to endure the infamous Bataan Death March on which 7,000–10,000 died or were murdered. The 13,000 survivors on Corregidor surrendered on 6 May.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Japan occupied the Philippines for over three years, until the surrender of Japan. A highly effective guerilla campaign by Philippine resistance forces controlled sixty percent of the islands, mostly jungle and mountain areas. MacArthur supplied them by submarine, and sent reinforcements and officers. Filipinos remained loyal to the United States, partly because of the American guarantee of independence, and also because the Japanese had pressed large numbers of Filipinos into work details and even put young Filipino women into brothels.[1]

</strong></p><p><strong>General MacArthur kept his promise to return to the Philippines on 20 October 1944. The landings on the island of Leyte were accompanied by a force of 700 vessels and 174,000 men. Through December 1944, the islands of Leyte and Mindoro were cleared of Japanese soldiers. During the campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army conducted a suicidal defense of the islands. Cities such as Manila were reduced to rubble. Around 500,000 Filipinos died during the Japanese Occupation Period.[2]</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation: tama na yan </strong></p><p></p><br />

                            14. list down the reason why during this period liberation was hard to achieve the book thief​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here are some reasons why liberation was hard to achieve during that period:</p><p></p><p>1. Nazi Regime: The book is set during the reign of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which had a tight grip on Germany and controlled every aspect of life, including freedom of expression and movement. The oppressive nature of the Nazi regime made it challenging for individuals or groups to openly resist or work towards liberation without facing severe consequences.</p><p></p><p>2. Fear and Intimidation: The Nazi regime employed brutal tactics to suppress dissent, including imprisonment, torture, and execution of those who opposed or resisted their rule. This atmosphere of fear and intimidation made it difficult for people to openly resist or work towards liberation, as they risked severe repercussions for themselves and their loved ones.</p><p></p><p>3. Surveillance and Informants: The Nazi regime employed a vast network of surveillance and informants, who reported on any signs of dissent or resistance. This made it challenging for individuals or groups to plan and coordinate liberation efforts without the risk of being exposed and swiftly dealt with by the authorities.</p><p></p><p>4. Lack of Resources: During the war, Germany was facing economic challenges, with shortages of food, fuel, and other essential resources. This made it difficult for any organized resistance movements to gather the necessary resources and support to mount a successful liberation effort.</p><p></p><p>5. Propaganda and Indoctrination: The Nazi regime used extensive propaganda and indoctrination to control the minds and beliefs of the German population. This made it challenging to mobilize widespread support for liberation efforts, as many people were influenced by the regime's ideologies and believed in their cause.</p><p></p><p>6. Military Superiority: The Nazi regime had a powerful military, which had a firm grip on Germany and occupied territories. This military superiority made it challenging for any resistance groups to challenge or overthrow the regime through conventional means, as they were outmatched in terms of resources and firepower.</p><p></p><p>7. Divided Loyalties: The book depicts how some characters had conflicting loyalties, torn between their personal beliefs and their loyalty to the Nazi regime. This internal struggle made it hard for them to openly support liberation efforts, as they feared repercussions from the regime or being seen as traitors by their peers.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p><p></p><p>In the XIXth century, Spain opened the Philippines to world trade and that stimulated a remarkable progress in commerce, agriculture and industry. Records show that foreign investors were permitted to do business in Manila as early as 1809. This opened the way to material prosperity and the Filipinos began to enjoy a higher standard of living. The improvement of agriculture, the opening of Manila and other ports to foreign commerce, the development of Manila as a commercial center, easier and faster communication with Spain, increased educational opportunities, and the offering of professional courses, and so forth, led to the emergence of another elite among the native population- the ilustrados. It was in this middle class that liberalism was to take root in the Philippines. Up to that time, the only career that enabled a Filipino to achieve some parity with the conquistadores was to be a priest, the increase of educational opportunities and professional courses opened new vistas for the ambitious scions of the rising class of well-to-do families. However, because of the religious values of the people, the priesthood still remained an attractive and relatively fruitful career.</p><p></p><p>The rise of the ilustrados would not caused the inquietude of the friars were it not for the fact that many of them were being influenced by liberal ideas emanating from the mother country. The revolt in Spain, which had deposed Isabella II, succeeded in establishing a Provisional Republic, which for about two years (1868-1870) put liberalism in the saddle. Under the republic, General Carlos Maria de la Torre, a fierce liberal, was appointed the Governor-General of the Philippines. He encouraged free and open discussion of political and social problems. He abolished strict censorship of the press. He encouraged Filipinos to speak out boldly for the political rights. He openly affirmed his support of the Filipinization of the clergy and the secularization of the parishes held by the friars.</p><p></p><p>In November of 1870, the Spanish Cortes elected a new constitutional monarch (an Italian prince, Amadeo, who reigned only three years) and six months later, brought a new Governor to the Philippines, General Rafael de Izquierdo. He was completely opposed to the liberal policies of his predecessor, and with the help of the monarchists and the friars, he revived press censorship, curtailed political discussions, and declared himself unsympathetic to secularization. De la Torre’s tenure of office was short but it was just long enough to wet the Filipinos’ appetite for their political and social rights. The hands of the clock could not be turned back.</p><p></p><p> </p><br />

                            23. What was the importance of the Guerrilla groups to the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>During World War II, guerrilla groups played an important role in the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese occupation. These groups were made up of local residents who organized themselves to resist Japanese rule and support the Allied war effort.</p><p></p><p>The importance of the guerrilla groups in the liberation of the Philippines was due to several key factors:</p><p></p>Intelligence Gathering: Guerrilla groups were able to gather valuable intelligence on Japanese military activities, including troop movements and weapons supplies. This information was crucial to the success of the Allied war effort and helped to guide the military operations of the Philippine resistance.Sabotage and Harassment: Guerrilla groups carried out acts of sabotage and harassment against the Japanese military, disrupting their operations and making it difficult for them to maintain control over the Philippines.Supplying Allies: Guerrilla groups were able to provide supplies and support to the Allied military, including food, ammunition, and other essential materials. This was critical to the success of the Allied war effort and helped to sustain the resistance.Morale Boosting: The guerrilla groups helped to boost the morale of the Philippine people by demonstrating that resistance was possible and that there was hope for the future. This inspired others to join the resistance and provided a source of inspiration for the Philippines people.<p>Overall, the guerrilla groups were an important factor in the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese rule. Through their actions, they helped to gather intelligence, disrupt Japanese operations, supply the Allies, and boost the morale of the Philippine people, all of which contributed to the eventual defeat of the Japanese and the liberation of the Philippines.</p><br />

                            27. What is the current type of economy of the Philippines? Is it more on trade liberalization or on protectionism? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines has been one of the most dynamic economies in the East Asia Pacific region. Average annual growth increased to 6.4% between 2010-2019 from an average of 4.5% between 2000-2009. With increasing urbanization, a growing middle class, and a large and young population, the Philippines’ economic dynamism is rooted in strong consumer demand supported by a vibrant labor market and robust remittances. Business activities are buoyant with notable performance in the services sector including business process outsourcing, real estate, tourism, and finance and insurance industries. The Philippine economy has also made progress in delivering inclusive growth, evidenced by a decline in poverty rates and its Gini coefficient. Poverty declined from 23.3% in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018 while the Gini coefficient declined from 44.9 to 42.7 over the same period.</p><p></p><p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic and community quarantine measures imposed in the country have severely impacted economic growth and poverty reduction. Growth contracted significantly in 2020, driven by heavy declines in consumption and investment growth, and exacerbated by the sharp slowdown in exports, tourism, and remittances. Similarly, the previous trend in real wages, which is expected to have a positive impact on household incomes—particularly those from the lower income groups—has been severely hampered by the impact of the COVID-19, with negative consequences also for poverty reduction in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, the economy has started to recover with a 3.7% year-on-year expansion in the first half of 2021, buoyed by public investment and a recovery in the external environment.  With continued recovery and reform efforts, the country is getting back on track on its way from a lower middle-income country with a gross national income per capita of US$3,430 in 2020 to an upper middle-income country (per capita income range of US$4,096–$12,695) in the short term. Economic growth is expected to further rebound assuming a containment of the virus domestically and globally, an acceleration of mass vaccination pace, and with more robust domestic activity bolstered by greater consumer and business confidence and the public investment momentum. The recovery is expected to also have overall positive impact on poverty reduction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>heart</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>follow</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>brainliest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lng</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><br />

                            28. Why are the Philippines, the US, Japan, and South Korea, among others, considered liberal countries? What characteristics are prevalent in these countries? Is liberalism advantageous to a country such as the Philippines? Explain your answer</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Since winning the Philippines presidential election by a comfortable margin, Rodrigo Duterte has made good on his promise to unleash lawless vigilantism to tackle the country’s very real problem with drugs. Due process and human rights went out the window. In three months more than 2,000 people have been killed with the blessing of the Malacanang Palace.</p><p></p><p>In Thailand, more than two years on from a “temporary” military coup, the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong was prevented from entering the country, evidently at Beijing’s behest.</p><p></p><p>Debate about Asia’s international politics is dominated by the nascent strategic competition between the US and China. This division is real, as both great powers have different and potentially irreconcilable visions for the region’s strategic order.</p><p></p><p>But there is a second and more complex cleavage that is important not only for the lives of Asia’s people and for that strategic contest: between liberal and illiberal Asia.</p><p></p><p>After decades of breakneck economic growth, east Asian states and societies have never been more prosperous. But the hope that this would prompt a flowering of liberalism has proven illusory. Following the rapid democratisation of several southeast Asian countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the forces of illiberalism have been on the march.</p><p></p><p>Thailand has fallen back to military rule. The Philippines has a proto-authoritarian strongman in power who cares little for liberal niceties. Malaysia is mired in political crisis, with the reformasi hopes from 1998 as far from view as ever. Meanwhile, in Japan, the Abe government has attacked media freedom and curtailed human rights in disconcerting ways.</p><p></p><p>The only positive story in recent years is the as-yet incomplete democratisation in Myanmar.</p><p></p><p>The liberal ideas to which I refer are not a synonym for democracy in the narrow electoral sense, but relate to key principles that underpin society. The most important of these relate to the impartial rule of law, rights to free expression and association that are respected and enforced, limits on state power, and the prevalence of markets in determining the shape of the society’s economy.</p><p></p><p>Countries like Indonesia and Australia are plainly liberal. China, North Korea and Laos are not. But most countries in the region exist somewhere on a continuum between those extremes, with illiberal forces more dominant than they were.</p><p></p><p>East Asia does not have the kind of clear division that defined European experience in the Cold War, in which geopolitical division mapped identically the political divide. Instead, the US has alliances and partnerships with countries that are liberal democracies, illiberal democracies, and authoritarian dictatorships among others.</p><p></p><p>In the contest for strategic influence, the US and its allies may see eye to eye. But real tensions exist among these partners on matters that are fundamental, at least in principle, to the underlying vision the US has for the region.</p><p></p><p>The recent tensions between Barack Obama and Duterte are only the most visible manifestation of this. If the Philippines does break with the US it will be in part because of differing views about the two governments’ approach to human rights and the rule of law.</p><p></p><p>The region has entered a period of open contestation. Most have tended to focus purely on the geopolitical aspects of this, but the contest is in fact much greater and more challenging. These circumstances make the US’ efforts to use liberal ideas like the rule of law and human rights to advance its interests and ambitions in the region much more complex.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea is not just about managing spheres of influence and distributions of force.
