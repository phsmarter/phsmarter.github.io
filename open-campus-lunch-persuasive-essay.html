                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student, I have noticed that the school cafeteria is not enough to sustain me throughout the day. I usually spend time at school in class and after school, so I need to find another place to eat. The closest place to go is McDonalds, but it's really expensive and they don't have much of a variety of food.</p><p></p><p>I was wondering if there was some way that we could get more variety at McDonalds without spending so much money? My brother told me about "Supervised Lunch", where you can bring your own lunch and they'll supervise it for you while you eat it. This sounds like a great idea!</p><p></p><p>-flwrxsnki</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. There are many people who are not wearing a face shield, gloves, and face mask some of them are not working and some of them have held hands they are not following the health protocol.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. As I observe in the public area, there were still many people who do not yet follow the health protocol of the government. Many of them put their face shields above their forehead, and when they talk they will put their mask below their mouth.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Another thing that I have observed is the social distancing of many people in the public area, they do not think about what will happen to them if they are closer than a 1-meter distance.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(essay)</p><p>should intimate relationship be allowed inside the campus? disagree</p><p>body,thesis,conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Thesis:</p><p>Intimate relationships should not be allowed inside the campus due to various negative effects on the individuals involved, as well as the academic environment as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Firstly, intimate relationships can negatively impact the academic performance of the individuals involved. Being in a relationship can be emotionally taxing and time-consuming, leading to a lack of focus and dedication towards studies. This can ultimately affect the overall academic environment, as a decline in individual performance can lead to a decline in the academic performance of the entire student body.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, intimate relationships can also result in a biased and unfair treatment of students. When two students in a relationship are given preferential treatment or grades, it can create resentment and tension among their peers. This can create a toxic environment where students feel like they are not being judged solely on their academic abilities, but on their personal relationships as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, intimate relationships can also lead to sexual harassment and abuse, particularly in cases where there is a power dynamic involved. Instructors or senior students may use their position of authority to engage in relationships with their subordinates or younger students, which can lead to exploitation and abuse.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, allowing intimate relationships on campus can create a distraction from the primary purpose of education. The campus is a place for learning, and relationships can take away from the focus on academic development. The presence of intimate relationships on campus can lead to unnecessary drama, rumors, and gossip, which can negatively impact the overall learning environment.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, intimate relationships should not be allowed inside the campus. The academic environment should remain focused on education and learning, and relationships can create a distraction from this goal. Additionally, intimate relationships can lead to biased treatment, abuse, and harassment, creating a toxic environment for all students. Therefore, it is important to maintain a professional and academic atmosphere within the campus, free from the complications and distractions of intimate relationships.</p><br />

                        <p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Allowing third gendered students to express themselves through their choice of clothing, including cross-dressing, is an important step towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming school environment. These students, who may identify as gender non-binary, genderqueer, or non-conforming, deserve the same respect and support as any other student, and permitting them to cross-dress on campus can help to validate their identities and promote acceptance.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, permitting third gendered students to cross-dress can help to reduce feelings of marginalization and isolation that these students may experience. Many third gendered individuals face discrimination and stigma simply for being who they are, and the act of expressing their gender through clothing can be an important form of self-expression and validation. Allowing them to do so on campus can help to create a more welcoming and supportive environment, where they feel free to be themselves.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, permitting third gendered students to cross-dress can help to promote a more inclusive and accepting school culture overall. When schools take steps to accommodate and support students of all genders, it sends a message to the entire student body that diversity is valued and respected. This can foster a sense of community and belonging that benefits all students, regardless of their gender identity.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it is important to recognize that permitting third gendered students to cross-dress is not just a matter of personal expression, but also a legal issue. Discrimination on the basis of gender identity is prohibited by federal and state laws, and schools have a responsibility to ensure that all students are treated equally and with respect. Allowing third gendered students to express themselves through their clothing choices is not only the right thing to do, but it is also a legal obligation.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, permitting third gendered students to cross-dress on campus is an important step towards creating a more inclusive and accepting school environment. Not only does it support the personal expression and validation of these students, but it also promotes a more inclusive and accepting school culture and fulfills the legal obligation to treat all students with respect and equality.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            25. essay about argumentative essay about technology. advantage and disadvantages of having a technology in the campus​</h2><br />
                        <p>Technology has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, including in the field of education. With the rapid advancement of technology, schools and universities have integrated technology into their curriculum and campus infrastructure. However, the use of technology in the campus has been the subject of debate, as it has both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will argue for and against the use of technology in the campus.</p><p></p><p>One of the major advantages of technology in the campus is its ability to enhance the learning experience. With the help of technology, students can access a vast array of educational resources, including online libraries, educational videos, and interactive software. This allows for a more personalized and interactive learning experience. Moreover, technology enables collaboration between students and teachers through online discussion forums and video conferencing.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage of technology in the campus is its ability to increase efficiency. With the use of technology, students can submit their assignments online, eliminating the need for printing and physically submitting papers. This saves time and resources for both students and teachers. In addition, technology can be used to automate administrative tasks, such as attendance tracking and grade recording, reducing the workload of teachers.</p><p></p><p>However, the use of technology in the campus also has its disadvantages. One of the major drawbacks is its potential to distract students from their studies. With the widespread use of social media and other entertainment applications, students may become more interested in browsing the internet than focusing on their studies. Moreover, the over-reliance on technology may lead to a decline in traditional skills, such as handwriting and critical thinking.</p><p></p><p>Another disadvantage of technology in the campus is its cost. The integration of technology requires a significant financial investment, including the purchase of hardware and software, as well as the cost of maintenance and upgrades. This may not be feasible for all educational institutions, particularly those in developing countries or those with limited resources.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while technology has brought significant advantages to the campus, it is not without its drawbacks. Therefore, it is important for educational institutions to strike a balance between the use of technology and traditional teaching methods, and to be mindful of its potential impact on students and the learning process. The proper integration of technology in the campus can enhance the learning experience and increase efficiency, but it must be done in a way that is responsible and sustainable.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>  </p><p>Human and physical geography features are things that you can see all around you.  Physical features like seas, mountains and rivers are natural. They would be here even if there were no people around.
Human features like houses, roads and bridges are things that have been built by people. Physical Geography is the study of the science of spaces; it examines the structures of the world around us- both natural and man-made- as well as the formative processes of these.</p><p></p><p> While Human geography or anthropogeography is the branch of geography that is associated and deals with humans and their relationships with communities, cultures, economies, and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across locations.</p><p></p><p>Human geography physical features are landforms, climate, soils, and hydrology. Things such as language, religion, political systems, economic systems, and population distribution are examples of human characteristics.  Some of the main cultural phenomena studied in human geography include language, religion, different economic and governmental structures, art, music, and other cultural aspects that explain how and/or why people function as they do in the areas in which they live. Human-Environment Interaction  adapt to and modify the environment. Humans shape the landscape through their interaction with the land, which has both positive and negative effects on the environment</p><p></p><p>Physical geography is the spatial study of natural phenomena that make up the environment, such as rivers, mountains, landforms, weather, climate, soils, plants, and any other physical aspects of the earth's surface. Physical geography focuses on geography as a form of earth science. There are human environment interaction in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water.</p><p></p><p>Geography helps us investigate and to think critically and creatively about the complexities of places, and different views and feelings relating to places. Geography is studied through inquiry, this requires the formulation of effective questions. Fieldwork and outdoor education are essential to geography. Human geography is a wide-ranging discipline that draws together many of the strands important for understanding the world today. It examines human societies and how they develop, their culture, economy and politics, all within the context of their environment. Physical geography is the study of Earth's seasons, climate, atmosphere, soil, streams, landforms, and oceans.</p><p><strong>Explanation: kung ayaw nyo sa sagot ko free to leave </strong></p><p><strong>salamat po</strong></p><br />
