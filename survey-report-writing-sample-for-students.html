- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

(5points each) The current Corona Virus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted and changed lives on a global scale since its emergence and spread from China in late 2019. It has caused millions of infections, and thousands of deaths worldwide. However, the control of this pandemic still remains unachievable. Therefore, this study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and perceptions of senior high school students towards the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,500 respondents were included in this preliminary report. A survey of knowledge, attitude, and perceptions towards the 2019 Corona virus pandemic in the Bataan province found that majority of the respondents had a61.6% satisfactory knowledge of the disease while the attitude of most respondents towards instituted preventive measures were 68.9% satisfactory and only 22% of the respondents were satisfied with their country’s handling of the pandemic.

Survey of Academic and General Reading in English On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas postgraduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. 75% sometimes read regional or local newspapers, 69% sometimes read books of fiction, 62% sometimes read general magazines, and 56% sometimes read national daily newspapers. On the other hand, 37% never read Sunday newspapers and 31% never read fiction. in the second section, not surprisingly, 100% read news about their own country newspapers and 56% read this first. 94% read international news, 25% read this first. 81% read about Britain and look at radio and TV information. T nly other item that is usually read by more than 50% of the students is current aff ead by 56%). If any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are, perhaps, as fol verseas students presumably have little time for general reading: most of their re ne is spent on books and journals on their own subject. Outside their studies m reading news about their own country, international news, and news about y probably spend most time watching TV and listening to the radio. m Academic Writing Course by R. R.

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />

(5points each) The current Corona Virus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted and changed lives on a global scale since its emergence and spread from China in late 2019. It has caused millions of infections, and thousands of deaths worldwide. However, the control of this pandemic still remains unachievable. Therefore, this study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and perceptions of senior high school students towards the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,500 respondents were included in this preliminary report. A survey of knowledge, attitude, and perceptions towards the 2019 Corona virus pandemic in the Bataan province found that majority of the respondents had a61.6% satisfactory knowledge of the disease while the attitude of most respondents towards instituted preventive measures were 68.9% satisfactory and only 22% of the respondents were satisfied with their country’s handling of the pandemic.

Survey of Academic and General Reading in English On 8th February 1999, a survey was conducted among 16 overseas postgraduate students at the University of England. The purpose of the survey was to discover the reading habits in English of the students. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with the type of reading and its frequency. The second section was concerned with newspapers: the type of items read and those that were read first. From the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. In the first section 81% of the students regularly read academic books" while 44% regularly read academic journals. Nothing else is read regularly or often by 40% or more of the students. The following comments can be made about the reading of newspapers, magazines and fiction. 75% sometimes read regional or local newspapers, 69% sometimes read books of fiction, 62% sometimes read general magazines, and 56% sometimes read national daily newspapers. On the other hand, 37% never read Sunday newspapers and 31% never read fiction. in the second section, not surprisingly, 100% read news about their own country newspapers and 56% read this first. 94% read international news, 25% read this first. 81% read about Britain and look at radio and TV information.

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />
                        <p>Ang isang pagtaas ng problema ng labis na pag-aalala para sa mga institusyong pang-akademiko ay ang paglaganap ng pandaraya sa mga mag-aaral. Ang karagdagang pagsasama-sama sa problemang ito ay mga pagsulong sa teknolohiya na lumikha ng mga bagong paraan para sa mga mag-aaral na makisali sa pandaraya. Sa kabila ng lumalaking interes sa pandaraya na pinadali ng teknolohiya, kaunti ang nalalaman tungkol sa kung bakit maaaring gumamit ang mga mag-aaral ng elektronikong mapagkukunan upang manloko. Gayunpaman, nag-aalok ang teorya ng panlipunan ng pagkatuto ni Akers ng isang makatuwirang paliwanag. Ang mga survey ay nakolekta mula sa isang sample ng 534 mga mag-aaral sa kolehiyo sa isang malaking timog-silangan na unibersidad upang masukat ang pagkalat at dalas ng pandaraya na pinadali ng Internet. Pinapayagan ng mga survey na ito ang isang paggalugad ng mga salik na nauugnay sa ganitong uri ng pandaraya at isang paghahambing sa pagitan ng tinutukoy namin bilang E-cheating at tradisyunal na mga paraan ng pandaraya. Ipinapahiwatig ng mga resulta na humigit-kumulang na 40% ng mga mag-aaral ang nakatuon sa ilang anyo ng E-cheating sa nakaraang taon. Ang mga variable ng pagkatuto sa lipunan ay lumalabas bilang pinakamalakas na tagahula ng parehong paglitaw at dalas ng E-cheating habang ang mga variable ng pagpipigil sa sarili at pilay ay may maliit na epekto.</p><br />
