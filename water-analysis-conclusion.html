The scientist goes to the library and reads a number of articles about the physicalproperties and composition of fresh and sea water.3. The scientist travels to a nearby beach, and observes the conditions there. The scientistnotes the taste of the sea water and other factors such as waves, wind, air-pressureand temperature.4. After considering all this information, the scientist sits at a desk and writes. My guessthat fresh water freezes faster than sea water because sea water has salt in it."5. The scientist goes back to the laboratory and does the followingFills each of two beakers with I liter of fresh water.Dissolves 35 grams of table salt in one of the beakers.Place both beakers in a refrigerator whose temperature is - 1 degree C.Leaves the beakers in the refrigerator for 24 hours.6. After 24 hours, the scientist examines both beakers and finds the fresh water to be froThe salt water is still liquidhe salt water is still liquid.Puestions:1. Which of the following statements describe an observation?Statement 3 because it tells how the scientist uses senses to gain information.2. Which statement draws up the conclusion?Statement 6 because it sums up the whole answer to the problem.3. Which statement illustrates the analysis of data?Statement 6 because it also tells how the data were processed.4.

The metal manufacturing plant might be causing decline in the fish population. It the metal manufacturing dumps their waste in water, then the aquatic life in the bay decreases. 3. The sharp decline in fish catch from the bay since June 2001 was due to deaths of the fish caused by water pollution that the metal company is answerable for. 4. There has been sharp decline in fish catch from Maharlika bay since June 2001. two months after metal manufacturing plant started its operation near bay area. 5.

Put a sugar cube in each of the hot water and cold water with the same size sugar cube and stir the sugar in both glasses of water.To calculate the speed of dissolution, you can use a timer to determine the time when the sugar cube starts to dissolve in the hot and cold water. <p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Sugar cube dissolved in hot water dissolves faster than in cold water. The solubility of a substance depends on the temperature of the solvent. The dissolution of a substance in a liquid is a melting event due to the breaking of bonds in the molecules of the solid. <br />Hot water temperature can increase the average kinetic energy of sugar molecules. Kinetic energy increases the sugar molecules and can cause the bonds between the molecules to break so that the sugar can dissolve completely faster in hot water.<br />Cold water temperature does not increase the kinetic energy of sugar molecules so sugar is more difficult to dissolve in cold water and the undissolved sugar grains are still rough and visible.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sugar cubes dissolved in hot water dissolve faster than in cold water.
