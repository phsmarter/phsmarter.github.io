This legacy of the former slum dweller had come up with the most creative way of learning, through his project known as “Pushcart Classrooms”. This project was propelled by him along with the Dynamic Team Company. According to Penaflorida, the primary objective of his project is to make education a right and a privilege to everyone, especially for those street children. Through this humble mission, he and his friends were able to motivate kids about the importance of learning. To make it survive the odds, they are earnestly searching for willing and generous scholarship benefactors, for the benefit of a needy kid; who wishes to go back to the four corners of the classroom.
