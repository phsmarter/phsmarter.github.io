This research study aims to find out the effectiveness of asynchronous online andprinted modular learning to the academic performance of working students,12. The respondents of the study are the Grade 10 working students of San FabianNational High School for the school year 2020-2021.13. A 2015 study by Heather Kauffmann explored factors predictive of student successand satisfaction with online learning. 111 Kauffmann notes that several studies havefound that online learning programmes lead to outcomes that are comparable tothose of face-to-face programmes.14. There is a significant difference between the students' performance in the pre-testand the post-test.15. This study used the experimental method of research since aims to find out theacademic performance of the Grade 10 students...A questionnaire and a test weregiven to the respondents... Data gathered from the students will be treated statisticallythrough the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).​</a>

Translate it into mathematical symbols or equations and solve for the answer. Procedures to be followed. Step 1 - Create your own 3 short routine math word problems that uses algebraic expression and egi with numbers, operational symbols, quantity (), and variables. Ex. The sum of twice x and 10 is 50. Step 2 - Translate it into mathematical symbols. 2x + 10 = 50 Step 3 - Solve for the answer. 2x + 10 - 10 = 50 -10 Step 2 - Translate it into mathematical symbols. 2x = 40 (divide both sides by 2 to 2 2 get the value of x) Step 3 - Solve for the answer. x = 20 - = Category 4 3 2. 1 Completion All of the assigned work is complete.

This research study aims to find out the effectiveness of asynchronous online andprinted modular learning to the academic performance of working students,12. The respondents of the study are the Grade 10 working students of San FabianNational High School for the school year 2020-2021.13. A 2015 study by Heather Kauffmann explored factors predictive of student successand satisfaction with online learning. 111 Kauffmann notes that several studies havefound that online learning programmes lead to outcomes that are comparable tothose of face-to-face programmes.14. There is a significant difference between the students' performance in the pre-testand the post-test.15. This study used the experimental method of research since aims to find out theacademic performance of the Grade 10 students...A questionnaire and a test weregiven to the respondents... Data gathered from the students will be treated statisticallythrough the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>Abstract
</p><p>The following study contrasts the efficacy of online delivery relative to face-to-
</p><p>face delivery using an enrolment protocol that largely eliminates self-selection 
</p><p>bias. Only a few previous studies even attempt to control for sample selection. 
</p><p>The study utilizes random assignment of the registrants of a Principles of 
</p><p>Macroeconomics class into two alternative venues: online and face-to-face. 
</p><p>The same professor taught both sections with the same course objectives and 
</p><p>exams. Both the change in student scores from the pre-test to the post-test 
</p><p>and the student’s exam average are modelled as a function of the course 
</p><p>environment, the student’s SAT math score (or ACT equivalent), the student’s
</p><p>GPA prior to taking the course, the student’s gender and the student’s overall 
</p><p>credit hours prior to taking the course. The pre- and post-test had both 
</p><p>standardized and instructor-specific questions. Students in the face-to-face 
</p><p>section have statistically significantly higher exam scores and statistically 
</p><p>significantly greater improvement on the post-test instructor questions. There 
</p><p>is no statistical difference in the improvement on the post-test overall nor in 
</p><p>the improvement in the post-test standardized questions. These mixed results 
</p><p>suggest that both course objectives and the mechanism used to assess the 
</p><p>relative effectiveness of the two modes of education may play an important 
</p><p>part in determining the relative effectiveness of alternative delivery methods.</p><p></p><p>sana makatulong ang sagot ko</p><p>hope its help you </p><p>thank you for your question</p><p></p><br />
