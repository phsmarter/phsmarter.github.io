1.
Animal testing has benefited
human health. People do not
contract polio anymore because
of a vaccine tested on animals.
Advances in antibiotics, insulin,
and other drugs have been made
possible through research done
on animals. Animal testing
should continue to benefit
medical research.
1.__________
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.
Drug testing using animals became
important in the twentieth century. In 1937,
a pharmaceutical company in the USA
created a preparation of sulfanilamide, using
diethylene glycol (DEG) as a solvent, and
called the preparation 'Elixir Sulfanilamide'.
DEG was poisonous to humans, but the
company's chief pharmacist and chemist
was not aware of this. He simply added
raspberry flavoring to the sulfa drug, which
he had dissolved in DEG, and the company
marketed the product. The preparation led
to mass poisoning causing the deaths of
more than a hundred people. No animal
testing was done. The public outcry caused
by this incident and other similar disasters
led to the passing of the 1938 Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act requiring safety
testing of drugs on animals before they could
be marketed.
2.__________

3.
Medical research involving animals
has dramatically improved the health
of the human race. Without animal
testing, the cure for polio would not
exist and diabetics would suffer or die
from their disease. Despite these
benefits, some people believe that
animals should be not be used for
testing medical techniques and drugs.
This essay will outline the advantages
of animal testing.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Animal testing is something we as people cant stop it from happening. Animals are tested to make up and being put through toucher day by day. Sure it could help cure disease for humans, but the last time I checked animals aren’t humans. Testing on an animal is unethical if you hate hunters for harming them down and killing them. What makes you any better than them when you use make-up that was tested on an animals. You know that animals are contained in harsh conditions, enduring suffering, and locked up in a cage for years. Does using animals as lab rats for good, shows that you sill have any humanity inside of you. On the other hand it helps scientists find cures for disease's and it's the only way that people don't get hurt. Finally to begin with, harming animals for testing drugs is unethical for human to do.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>sana makatulong <br />

Eventhe main goal of science is to uplift the life of every individual whendiscoveries, invention and innovation happens. Animal advocates sees theuse of animal is harmful in the environment and as well as to the animalitself. They also see it as an ineffectiive way of experimentation comparedwith the use of plants like what Mendel did. As a student, what is yourstand in the use of animals inside the lab?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Each year, more than 100 million animals—including mice, rats, frogs, dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, monkeys, fish, and birds—are killed in U.S. laboratories for biology lessons, medical training, curiosity-driven experimentation, and chemical, drug, food, and cosmetics testing. Before their deaths, some are forced to inhale toxic fumes, others are immobilized in restraint devices for hours, some have holes drilled into their skulls, and others have their skin burned off or their spinal cords crushed. In addition to the torment of the actual experiments, animals in laboratories are deprived of everything that is natural and important to them—they are confined to barren cages, socially isolated, and psychologically traumatized. The thinking, feeling animals who are used in experiments are treated like nothing more than disposable laboratory equipment.</strong></p><p><strong>Hope it helps!</strong></p><p><strong>Brainliest me for more!</strong></p><p></p><br />

1.
Animal testing has benefited
human health. People do not
contract polio anymore because
of a vaccine tested on animals.
Advances in antibiotics, insulin,
and other drugs have been made
possible through research done
on animals. Animal testing
should continue to benefit
medical research.
1.__________
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.
Drug testing using animals became
important in the twentieth century. In 1937,
a pharmaceutical company in the USA
created a preparation of sulfanilamide, using
diethylene glycol (DEG) as a solvent, and
called the preparation 'Elixir Sulfanilamide'.
DEG was poisonous to humans, but the
company's chief pharmacist and chemist
was not aware of this. He simply added
raspberry flavoring to the sulfa drug, which
he had dissolved in DEG, and the company
marketed the product. The preparation led
to mass poisoning causing the deaths of
more than a hundred people. No animal
testing was done. The public outcry caused
by this incident and other similar disasters
led to the passing of the 1938 Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act requiring safety
testing of drugs on animals before they could
be marketed.
2.__________
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
3.
Medical research involving animals
has dramatically improved the health
of the human race. Without animal
testing, the cure for polio would not
exist and diabetics would suffer or die
from their disease. Despite these
benefits, some people believe that
animals should be not be used for
testing medical techniques and drugs.
This essay will outline the advantages
of animal testing.
