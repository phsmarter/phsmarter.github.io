Filipinos who came of age after the golden era of Pilipino komiks have not known the works of Francisco V. Coching. 2. Born in 1919, Coching's father was the popular novelist Gregorio Coching, from whom he no doubt inherited some of his storytelling flair. 3. Despite having only a fifth-grade education and no formal art training, Francisco had a wild uninhabited imagination and raw talent to spare. 4. An apprenticeship in Liwayway magazine gave him his start in the komiks trade. 5. This was interrupted by the war, during which Coching joined the Hunter-ROTC guerillas. 6. The postwar years saw the full flowering of his art when he found his forte in action- adventure stories, 7. He created Hagibis, a Pinoy analogue to Tarzan; Sabas ang Barbaro, an 1860s anti- Spanish adventurer, and the anting-anting wielding folk hero Pedro Penduko. 8. Coching's panels are distinctive in that they are fairly bursting at the seams with virile energy as well-muscled heroes strike dramatic poses and explode into action 9. He was also a rarity in that he wrote and illustrated his own stories. 10. Coching died in 1998, four months short of his 80th birthday, leaving a legacy that is still vibrant and captivating, though now seldom seen,​</a>

                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning.

I could still hear my father play music using theturntable And as the time goes by, nobody under eighteen years old wouldask about, well those next to it like tape recorders, compact disk or CD.Your expressions date you. For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2.

                            10. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />

Excerpt from The Summer Solstice by Nic Joaquin Source: https://idoc.pub/documents/excerpt-of-short-stories-written-by-filipino-writers-6nge Zigd121 Excerpt 2 The purpose of this paper is to explore the themes discussed in The Metamorphosis (Katka, 1915). An example of surrealist literature, this book is much more than a classic story about a man who transitions into an insect. The primary theme of this work relates to the dehumanization of man in a capitalistic society.

However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics. COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territorles had tested positive for COVID-19.

                            23. please answer this..title - ChangesBy Rachael C CastroWhen I was younger. I could still hear my father play music using theturntable And as the time goes by, nobody under eighteen years old wouldask about, well those next to it like tape recorders, compact disk or CD.Your expressions date you. For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2.
