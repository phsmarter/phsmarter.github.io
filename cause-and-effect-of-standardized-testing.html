Given the statements below, choose the statements that will help your position to persuade them to get vaccinated Put a checkmark (n) on the item that you think will strengthen your position that Sinovac is as efficient as others in achieving herd immunity against COVID-19. 1. Sinovac vaccine developed by China has been found to be 50.4% effective in Brazilian clinical trials, according to the latest results released by researchers. 2 Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is behind CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine. It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. 3. Results show that the vaccine is 78% effective in preventing mild cases that needed treatment and 100% effective in staving off moderate to serious cases 4. On the face of it, 50% effectiveness figure isn't as good as Oxford's 70% or Pfizer and Moderna's 95%. But trials are run very differently in different countries, the number of volunteers enrolled varies wildly, as do the criteria used to test how much protection the vaccines offer 5 One of Sinovac's main advantages is that it can be restored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the Oxford vaccine, which is made from genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees​</a>

                                            0 Students Should Not Be Allowed to Bring Mobile Phones to School (Excerpted) In recent times, the number of people owning mobile phones has increased dramatically. Now mobile phones are not just for calling, but you can now text, take and send pictures, record videos, access the internet, play games and much more The variety of functions has increased dramatically. They have also become a lot cheaper. Thus more and more young people now own a mobile. So should they be allowed to bring them to school? Mobile phones can cause a distraction in education. They can disturb teachers and students For example, if you were working hard on a piece of work, concentrating hard, and a person's phone rings, it disrupts the whole class. You may become side- tracked or the teacher may be interrupted during speaking to the class. Thus teaching would be constantly disrupted if this kept happening. Thus education standards would deteriorate. Looking then at long term effects, if this was happening every day, you would be wasting five minutes a day, so nearly half an hour a week, and so that would be over ten hours a year of disruption. Also, mobile phones provide a large temptation to cheat in tests. They can communicate to almost anywhere and anyone in the world. Because they are small, students can quietly and discreetly send a text and it can go unnoticed. You got to school to learn, not to waste time playing games or cheating in tests. Research has proven that frequent use of a mobile phone can put the owner at risk of long term health damage. Mobile phones have radiation in them which they send out which can destroy or damage cells. Thus a student who uses a mobile phone regularly is at risk of health damage. With the increase in ownership of mobiles, there 3.do you agree with the whiter? 4.what kind of whiting is this?​</a>

Sinovac vaccine developed by China has been found to be 50.4% effective in Brazilian clinical trials, according to the latest results released by researchers. 2 Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is behind CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine. It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. 3. Results show that the vaccine is 78% effective in preventing mild cases that needed treatment and 100% effective in staving off moderate to serious cases 4. On the face of it, 50% effectiveness figure isn't as good as Oxford's 70% or Pfizer and Moderna's 95%. But trials are run very differently in different countries, the number of volunteers enrolled varies wildly, as do the criteria used to test how much protection the vaccines offer 5 One of Sinovac's main advantages is that it can be restored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the Oxford vaccine, which is made from genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees​</h2><br />

                            6. 0 Students Should Not Be Allowed to Bring Mobile Phones to School (Excerpted) In recent times, the number of people owning mobile phones has increased dramatically. Now mobile phones are not just for calling, but you can now text, take and send pictures, record videos, access the internet, play games and much more The variety of functions has increased dramatically. They have also become a lot cheaper. Thus more and more young people now own a mobile. So should they be allowed to bring them to school? Mobile phones can cause a distraction in education. They can disturb teachers and students For example, if you were working hard on a piece of work, concentrating hard, and a person's phone rings, it disrupts the whole class. You may become side- tracked or the teacher may be interrupted during speaking to the class. Thus teaching would be constantly disrupted if this kept happening. Thus education standards would deteriorate. Looking then at long term effects, if this was happening every day, you would be wasting five minutes a day, so nearly half an hour a week, and so that would be over ten hours a year of disruption. Also, mobile phones provide a large temptation to cheat in tests. They can communicate to almost anywhere and anyone in the world. Because they are small, students can quietly and discreetly send a text and it can go unnoticed. You got to school to learn, not to waste time playing games or cheating in tests. Research has proven that frequent use of a mobile phone can put the owner at risk of long term health damage. Mobile phones have radiation in them which they send out which can destroy or damage cells. Thus a student who uses a mobile phone regularly is at risk of health damage. With the increase in ownership of mobiles, there 3.do you agree with the whiter? 4.what kind of whiting is this?​</h2><br />

                        Measure of Central Tendency<p>The measure which describes the center of the distribution. A single value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data. A summary statistic that represents the center point or typical value of a data set. There are three major measures of central tendency: the median, the mean and the mode.
