                                            10. Bill Clinton's "I Have Sinned" Speech on Monica Lewinsky I agree with those who have said that in my first statement after I testified was not contrite enough. I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I fee is genuine: first and most important, my family, also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people. I have asked al for their forgiveness... But I believe that to be forgiven, more than sorrow is required at least two more things. First, genuine repentance - a determination to change and to repair breaches of my own making. I have repented. Second, what my bible calls a "broken spirit"; an understanding that I must have God's help to be the person that I want to be; a willingness to give the very forgiveness I seek; a renunciation of the pride and the anger which cloud judgment, lead people to excuse and compare and to blame and complain. a. to inform b. to persuade c. to entertain d. to motivate​</a>

Every country is now grappling with or poised to suffer the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: the tens of thousands of lost lives; the broken families; the overwhelmed hospitals; the overworked essential workers. ___ 3. While the COVID-19 pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis, its implications are much more far-reaching. We are already seeing its ruinous social and economic impacts, as governments around the world struggle to find the most effective responses to rising unemployment and the economic downturn.___ 4. We are all struggling to absorb the unfolding shock: the jobs that have disappeared and businesses that have suffered; the fundamental and drastic shift to our daily lives, and the fear that the worst is still yet to come, especially in the developing world and countries already battered by armed conflict. ___ 5. But the pandemic also poses a significant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security -- potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease.​</a>

Here's an example for the topic "Importance of Education":</p><p></p><p>TOPIC SENTENCE: Education is a fundamental aspect of human life.</p><p></p><p>OPENER/INTRODUCTION: Good day everyone. Today, I would like to talk about the importance of education.</p><p></p><p>BODY: Education is an essential ingredient in developing individuals and societies. It is through education that people gain knowledge, skills, and values that enable them to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. The benefits of education are vast, from personal growth to social and economic development. For one, education can improve people's lives by giving them a better understanding of the world around them. It allows them to make informed decisions and think critically. Moreover, education can unlock opportunities for people, such as higher-paid jobs, improved health outcomes, and increased participation in civic life.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why education is essential is that it builds character, instills values, and shapes attitudes. Education cultivates a sense of responsibility, respect for others, and a desire for lifelong learning. Also, it promotes tolerance, empathy, and understanding between cultures and communities. Education can foster social cohesion and harmony, which are critical in building peaceful and prosperous societies.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, education is an investment in the future. It is through education that we can address the complex challenges facing our world, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. By equipping people with the right skills and knowledge, education can help create a more sustainable and equitable world.</p><p></p><p>AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, education is crucial in shaping the future of individuals and communities. It empowers people to fulfill their potential, contribute to society, and make a positive impact on the world. Therefore, let us all recognize the importance of education and work to ensure that everyone has access to quality education and lifelong learning opportunities. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            10. 10. Bill Clinton's "I Have Sinned" Speech on Monica Lewinsky I agree with those who have said that in my first statement after I testified was not contrite enough. I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I fee is genuine: first and most important, my family, also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people. I have asked al for their forgiveness... But I believe that to be forgiven, more than sorrow is required at least two more things. First, genuine repentance - a determination to change and to repair breaches of my own making. I have repented. Second, what my bible calls a "broken spirit"; an understanding that I must have God's help to be the person that I want to be; a willingness to give the very forgiveness I seek; a renunciation of the pride and the anger which cloud judgment, lead people to excuse and compare and to blame and complain. a. to inform b. to persuade c. to entertain d. to motivate​</h2><br />

                            14. Arrange the speech excerpt according to the logical factors in public speaking by writing numbers 1-5 before each numbered parts. ____ 1. My concerns are many and widespread, but let me identify eight risks that are particularly pressing: First, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further erode trust in public institutions, particularly if citizens perceive that their authorities mishandled the response or are not transparent on the scope of the crisis. ____ 2. . Every country is now grappling with or poised to suffer the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: the tens of thousands of lost lives; the broken families; the overwhelmed hospitals; the overworked essential workers. ___ 3. While the COVID-19 pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis, its implications are much more far-reaching. We are already seeing its ruinous social and economic impacts, as governments around the world struggle to find the most effective responses to rising unemployment and the economic downturn.___ 4. We are all struggling to absorb the unfolding shock: the jobs that have disappeared and businesses that have suffered; the fundamental and drastic shift to our daily lives, and the fear that the worst is still yet to come, especially in the developing world and countries already battered by armed conflict. ___ 5. But the pandemic also poses a significant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security -- potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease.​</h2><br />
