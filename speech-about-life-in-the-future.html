If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future. Source: DENR Secretary Gina Lopez at COP22, Marrakech, Morocco. November 17, 2016 1. What is the speech all about? 2.

                                            Directions: Read the excerpt below from Mandela's speech, "The Rainbow Nation" and underline the five (5) emphasis markers used. yu gat igir ku! m ga a Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time democracy also requires that the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded. The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. The cornerstone of building a better life of opportunity, freedom and prosperity is the Reconstruction and Development Programme. This needs unity of purpose. It needs in action. It requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections. They want changel And change is what they will get. Our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. The government will devise policies that encourage and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - African, Coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroads into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today, and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.  ​</a>

Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair.

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</a>

                                            young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

                                            An efficient presentation must have a minimized content because it maintains a clear message, avoid being fancy by using fonts that are easy to read, keep things simple through the use of bullets or short sentences, use charts and graphs that are simple so that they will not distract the audience, being consistent in the layout including font size and styles must be followed, and be mindful of the contrast. When you apply this personally and professionally whenever you are making report to show a summary of a particular topic or maybe an accomplishment in your future company, it will guarantee you a better output.According to Stephen Keague, an author of books in public speaking, “In presentation or speeches less really is more.” You must remember that your message must be crystal clear to your audience.

                                            democracy is based on the majoruty principle. this is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rigths. at the same time, democracy also requires that the rigth of political and other minorities be safeguarded. the task at hand on will not be easy. but you have mandated us to change south africa from a country in which the majority lived witg little hope, to one in whicg they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. the cornerstone of building a better life of opportunitt, freedon and prosperity is the reconstruction and development programme. this needs unity of pupose. it needs in action. it requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. the people of south africa have spoken in these elections. they want change! and change is what they will get. our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all south africans. we will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. by encoyraging investors and the demicratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturinf will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. the goverment will devise policies that encourage and reward productive and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - african, coloured and indian. by easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroeds into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. while we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a goverment of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. we place our vision of a new constitutional order for south africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conqyered. we speak as fellow citizens to heak the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. this is the challenge that faces all south africans today, and it is one to which i am certain we will all rise. read another excerpt from mandela's speech, “the rainbow nation” and underline the emphasis markers used. an example is provided for you!Plssssss paki sagot po ng maayosunderline the emphasis markers used​</a>

                                            PLEASE ANSWER CORRECTLY :(((Read the following speech below. Then pick out the cohesive devices used in the statements.Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells pre effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planet's history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose. 7 As the Secretary for the environment, we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message it can be done, and we can do it! The rules of the Paris Agreement can state what the performance indicators of these models should be. There is an integratedness of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non- negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together.

                            7. Directions: Read the excerpt below from Mandela's speech, "The Rainbow Nation" and underline the five (5) emphasis markers used. yu gat igir ku! m ga a Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time democracy also requires that the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded. The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. The cornerstone of building a better life of opportunity, freedom and prosperity is the Reconstruction and Development Programme. This needs unity of purpose. It needs in action. It requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections. They want changel And change is what they will get. Our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. The government will devise policies that encourage and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - African, Coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroads into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today, and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.  ​</h2><br />

Read Vice President Leni Robredo graduation message to Class of 2020 and identify its geographic and linguistic dimension Dearest Class of 2020 Congrats to you and to your proud parents for making this f I know this is not how you imagined your graduation to be-no applause, no IG worthy photos no partes, no big speeches. Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair. We need to book beyond ourselves and expand our circles of empathy-whom we wil help, whom we will, whom wer will ve for We need to ask the hand, important questions How can I make the world a better place for others? How do I make sure that I will love this world better man when bund it? Where am most needed now? Many of you have big dreams. Some of you want to be doctors and act wyers and accourants, engineers and architects, teachers and joumalas anong many others There a reason so put your rews on hot in fact, you called to pursue these dreams with even deeper sovet dream not only for yourselves and for your families, but for the at the east and the t Move forward Amid difficulty, what keeps me going is seeing that each small task, each affor help someone goes a long way. That every food pack eases a bit of the burden on families who have lost their incomes. That every protective equipment aut makes a medical front-liner foul safer. That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals. Forward knowing that doing aomeng for acmeone else can be a spul save for the cray that we c Forward, knowing that we are caled to do everything we can for the good of others especially those that need hep the most Looking outward and moving forward-this is how we can bravely face the new world. With passion and purpose. With grit and resolve Win compassion and with courage Dear graduates, no matter what the future holds, stay on the side of courage and be nopetal for better days.

                            11. identify whether the speech below is memorized, extemporaneous or impromptu.1. My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</h2><br />

                            12. young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

                            15. An efficient presentation must have a minimized content because it maintains a clear message, avoid being fancy by using fonts that are easy to read, keep things simple through the use of bullets or short sentences, use charts and graphs that are simple so that they will not distract the audience, being consistent in the layout including font size and styles must be followed, and be mindful of the contrast. When you apply this personally and professionally whenever you are making report to show a summary of a particular topic or maybe an accomplishment in your future company, it will guarantee you a better output.According to Stephen Keague, an author of books in public speaking, “In presentation or speeches less really is more.” You must remember that your message must be crystal clear to your audience. An efficient presentation skill is a valuable life skill, which will help your future education and your future careers and eventually lead you to your journey to success.Now, let’s say that you are going to make a presentation about a short story in your literature subject, will you follow the tips mentioned in this module?

                            16. democracy is based on the majoruty principle. this is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rigths. at the same time, democracy also requires that the rigth of political and other minorities be safeguarded. the task at hand on will not be easy. but you have mandated us to change south africa from a country in which the majority lived witg little hope, to one in whicg they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. the cornerstone of building a better life of opportunitt, freedon and prosperity is the reconstruction and development programme. this needs unity of pupose. it needs in action. it requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. the people of south africa have spoken in these elections. they want change! and change is what they will get. our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all south africans. we will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. by encoyraging investors and the demicratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturinf will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. the goverment will devise policies that encourage and reward productive and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - african, coloured and indian. by easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroeds into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. while we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a goverment of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. we place our vision of a new constitutional order for south africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conqyered. we speak as fellow citizens to heak the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. this is the challenge that faces all south africans today, and it is one to which i am certain we will all rise. read another excerpt from mandela's speech, “the rainbow nation” and underline the emphasis markers used. an example is provided for you!Plssssss paki sagot po ng maayosunderline the emphasis markers used​</h2><br />

                            17. PLEASE ANSWER CORRECTLY :(((Read the following speech below. Then pick out the cohesive devices used in the statements.Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells pre effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planet's history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose. 7 As the Secretary for the environment, we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message it can be done, and we can do it! The rules of the Paris Agreement can state what the performance indicators of these models should be. There is an integratedness of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non- negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future. ​</h2><br />
