                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Managing Senioritis In today’s society, being a senior in high school is tough. This one year we are expected to decide what we are going to do with our lives by picking a career path to follow and going to a college that can teach us how to excel in that career path. We need to be able to dazzle these colleges and employers with not only our knowledge, but with our extracurricular activities, our skills acquired from jobs that we are expected to have, and recommendation letters from people we have made big impacts on in our lives so far. Dealing with all of these things could make you feel “stressed to the max”, or even get to the point where you are diagnosed with senioritis. If you …show more content…Just thinking about what to do after high school can cause a senior’s stress level to sky rocket. It is scary thinking about what we are going to do when our parents aren’t by our sides or can quickly be at our sides by just one phone call. Before we can make it into that next step in our lives, like college, we have to think about what we want to do for a career and if we could make a living in that career path. Soon after that comes applying for colleges that fit the career path we are interested in (or the path that makes us a large amount of money, even though we may not like it). After applying, we need the money to pay for our schooling. We start filling out scholarships, adding all of the wonderful qualities we have acquired over time and the sparkling achievements we have earned throughout our lifetime. Another important part to college and scholarships is making sure you have a high ACT score. The ACT could determine whether you are able to apply for a scholarship that can get you a full ride to college meaning all expenses are paid for or determine if you even make it into a college. It is just one more thing we have to worry about and schedule. On top of all of this planning for the future, we are members or officers of clubs, trying to maintain jobs, completing schoolwork, making time for our families and friends, and trying make everything work out, so we don’t have to sacrifice one<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Teacher Who Inspires Me</p><p></p><p>Throughout our academic journey, we meet different types of teachers - some are strict, some are lenient, and some are just there to fulfill their job description. However, there are only a few teachers who leave a lasting impact on our lives. For me, that teacher is Mrs. Smith.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Smith was my English teacher in high school, and she was unlike any other teacher I had ever met. She had a unique way of teaching, which made the subject interesting and engaging. Her classes were always full of fun activities, discussions, and debates. She had an incredible passion for literature, and it was evident in the way she taught.</p><p></p><p>What inspired me the most about Mrs. Smith was her dedication towards her students. She was not just a teacher, but a mentor, a guide, and a friend. She was always available to help her students, even beyond the classroom. She encouraged us to pursue our interests and to think outside the box. She always believed in our potential and motivated us to do our best.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Smith was not just concerned about our academic performance, but our overall development as well. She often gave us valuable life lessons, which have stayed with me even today. Her positivity and enthusiasm were infectious, and it was impossible to leave her class without feeling inspired.</p><p></p><p>Under her guidance, I discovered my love for literature and writing. She always pushed me to take on new challenges and to never settle for mediocrity. It was her encouragement that helped me become a better writer and develop my own unique style.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Mrs. Smith was not just a teacher who taught me English, but a teacher who inspired me to become a better person. She instilled in me a love for learning, a passion for literature, and a drive to succeed. She is the reason why I believe that teachers can make a significant impact on their students' lives. I am grateful to have had her as my teacher and will always cherish the lessons she taught me.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I have had many teachers in my lifetime and each one of them has affected my attitude toward education in a unique way. I have developed a different relationship with each one of them; and of course, I reminisce about some of my teachers more than other s. A teacher never knows which student he or she is going to inspire to achieve his or her goals. Sometimes, a teacher might feel that he or she has not done much for a student, but that student might feel that that particular teacher has highly contributed to his or her education and has undoubtedly affected his or her attitude about education in a positive way. The purpose of this essay is to describe a teacher who has positively affected my attitude toward education.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>              <strong>           "The Most Memorable Day of my Life"</strong><br />      The most memorable day of my life was, September 4, 1995 in Chicago, IL. It was 6:00 a.m. when my alarm clock woke me up. The first day of high school was finally here. I was excited, but a lot more nervous. I got out of bed, got ready, and then was on my way to the bus stop. All I could think of is the stories I heard about high school being so horrible with all the mean teachers, the hard tests, and of course being a freshman does not help either. The bus ride to the school was only 30 minutes, but it seemed a lot longer. When we finally got there, I was more nervous than ever. The day ahead of me was about to get a lot more…show more content…</p><p>        Their names were Susan and Alicia. I called them over and I talked with Susan and Alicia. That is when I introduced myself, then they did the same and we began to know more about each other, Susan and Alicia asked me where I was from and I said, “I am from Puerto Rico.” Then I asked Susan and Alicia where they were from and Susan said, “She was from New York” and Alicia said, “She was from Indiana”. After that, we spent the rest of the day together until the class was over. I will always remember that day because I had a chance to meet new friends. In addition, I met the most important friends that I have ever had.</p><p>    As the school year progressed, I made many more friends that are new and even joined a club. This club was just for members of the football team, the student staff, and the cheerleaders. My friends and I became members because we were the team equipment managers. The name of our club was the dog pound. We had t-shirts and worked all the school events when the football team was involved, such as the home coming game and pep rallies, we had fun all year long. My friends and I were even members of the food service program. We cooked and served meals for different events and for different people in the school all year long. We also had cooking competitions were we won different types of awards and sometimes we were offered scholarships to different cooking schools. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p>When achieving our goals, having a supportive family is a huge asset. They can offer emotional support and advice on how to deal with the difficulties you may face. They can also provide financial assistance and serve as motivation to continue moving forward. Having the support of your family can also make the process more enjoyable and give you the confidence to take risks. Having a family who believes in you and is willing to assist you can make all the difference in achieving your objectives. Our families can provide us with the support, advice, and resources to succeed. My family has been an invaluable source of support for my personal goals. Whenever things seem overwhelming, they encouraged me and provided the resources I needed to stay on track. I was always fascinated by the stars in the night sky as a child. I'd lie in my bed and gaze at the blanket of stars, daydreaming about distant lands. My parents encouraged my goals and supported me in whatever I chose. I'd tell them about the places I wanted to visit, the activities I wanted to do, and the people I wanted to meet. I would do this because I knew they would never let me down. My goals shifted over time, but my family was always there to support me. They helped me develop into the person I am today. They never gave up on me, and for that, I am grateful. My family is my greatest cheerleader and supporter. They have provided me with the inspiration and encouragement I require to keep moving forward. And I know they will always be there for me. I will be eternally grateful to my family, and I know they are the reason I can achieve my goals. They are always there for me, no matter what my dreams are. I will be eternally grateful for their love and support, and I am confident that they will continue to help me achieve my goals.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.</p><p>Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food. </p><p>In the COVID-19 crisis food security, public health, and employment and labour issues, in particular workers’ health and safety, converge. Adhering to workplace safety and health practices and ensuring access to decent work and the protection of labour rights in all industries will be crucial in addressing the human dimension of the crisis. Immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods should include extending social protection towards universal health coverage and income support for those most affected. These include workers in the informal economy and in poorly protected and low-paid jobs, including youth, older workers, and migrants. Particular attention must be paid to the situation of women, who are over-represented in low-paid jobs and care roles. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ginger pasta is a delightful dish that combines the warm and spicy flavor of ginger with the comforting texture of pasta. This dish is a great way to introduce new and exciting flavors into your cooking repertoire, and it is sure to impress any dinner guests with its unique and bold taste.</p><p></p><p>One of the best things about ginger pasta is its versatility. This dish can be made with a variety of pasta shapes and sizes, from spaghetti to linguine to penne. Additionally, the sauce can be customized to suit your preferences. For example, if you prefer a spicier dish, you can add more ginger or chili flakes to the sauce. If you prefer a milder flavor, you can reduce the amount of ginger and garlic in the sauce.</p><p></p><p>To make ginger pasta, you will first need to cook your pasta of choice according to the package instructions. While the pasta is cooking, you can prepare the ginger sauce. To do this, you will need to finely chop a fresh ginger root and a few cloves of garlic. In a large skillet, heat up some sesame oil and sauté the ginger and garlic until they are fragrant.</p><p></p><p>Once the ginger and garlic are fragrant, you can add in some soy sauce and continue to cook the sauce until it has thickened slightly. At this point, you can add in your cooked pasta and toss everything together until the pasta is coated in the ginger sauce. Garnish with some green onions or sesame seeds for an extra pop of flavor and texture.</p><p></p><p>One of the great things about ginger pasta is that it can be enjoyed on its own or paired with a variety of proteins and vegetables. For example, you can add some sautéed mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions to the dish for added flavor and nutrition. Alternatively, you can serve the pasta alongside some grilled chicken or shrimp for a complete meal.</p><p></p><p>Another benefit of ginger pasta is its health benefits. Ginger is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce pain and inflammation in the body. Additionally, ginger has been shown to aid in digestion and improve overall gut health. By incorporating ginger pasta into your diet, you can enjoy these health benefits while still indulging in a delicious and satisfying meal.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its health benefits, ginger pasta is also a great option for those following a vegetarian or vegan diet. The dish can easily be made without any animal products, and the sauce is packed with flavor and nutrition.</p><p></p><p>Overall, ginger pasta is a delightful and unique dish that is sure to impress any dinner guests. With its bold and spicy flavor, this dish is a great way to introduce new and exciting flavors into your cooking routine. Whether enjoyed on its own or paired with your favorite proteins and vegetables, ginger pasta is a versatile and delicious option for any occasion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Brainliest please </p><p></p><br />
