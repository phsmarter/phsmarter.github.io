                                            Your Best
If you always try your best 
Then you'll never have to wonder 
About what you could have done 
If you'd summoned all your thunder
And if your best
Was not as good
As you hoped
It would be,
You still could say
"I gave today
All that I had in me."

The stanza above tells us that :
A. There is always ups and downs in life. 
B. Don’t lose hope; you will have your turn. 
C. One must do his/her best for a good result.

                                            Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard to find, but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime. Other friends may not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.Pricelessness Of A True FriendA true friend is a rare gem, and I'm blessed with one - the inspiration for this poem. If you also have that special friend, I hope this helps you celebrate him/her. You may hum the good old "My Mother" tune as you read. Hope you enjoy it.GIVE 1 EXAMPLE OF POEM ABOUT FRIENDSHIP​</a>

                            20. Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard to find, but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime. Other friends may not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.Pricelessness Of A True FriendA true friend is a rare gem, and I'm blessed with one - the inspiration for this poem. If you also have that special friend, I hope this helps you celebrate him/her. You may hum the good old "My Mother" tune as you read.
