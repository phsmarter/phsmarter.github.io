Those Majestic Mountains Dome Mountains Folded (Complex) Mountains Volcanic Mountains We are lucky to have many mountains around us. Although they may look the same, they are formed differently.

When a large area moves vertically, leaving some places up and the others down, block mountains are formed. Volcanic mountains, like Mt. Fuji, are formed because of a volcanic activity. Lastly, dome mountains are formed when a large glob of magma rises to the surface, cools, and becomes a large dome of rock. Informational texts have certain features.

                                            Read the paragraph below. Distinguish text-types according to purpose by determining its type- Descriptive or Classification. One sunny day, my little puppy jumped onto our red couch and played with his new toy. I liked to watch him play and it made me feel happy? Soon my playful puppy yawned. He was a tired puppy. I picked him up and laid him on his soft, round bed. Soon, my sleepy puppy was snoring away. _______________________________________ Chilled strawberry ice cream is an amazing treat. It is very creamy and has a very smooth texture. Pineapple slices make it colorful. Strawberries add bright and red color too. It also makes an ice cream taste wonderful. White soft cream is added to make the dessert look beautiful. The ice cream is served with crispy biscuit to make it tastes more delicious. _______________________________________ Seashells belong to mollusca or mollusks. There are more than 100,000 kinds of mollusks living in the sea for about 500 million years now. There are many classifications of mollusks. Two of these are being single-shelled and two-shelled. Single-shelled mollusks crawl using their muscle that acts as their foot. Their shells are usually spiraling. Two-shelled mollusks have two valves joining by hinges. These open and close the valves of the shell. _______________________________________ The warm weather allows me to play outside. I play under the sprinkler with my younger brother. We run through the cold water and scream each time! At night, I play hide and seek with my good friends. I usually hide in a big bush; I love it when the weather is warm! _______________________________________ Dogs are domesticated animals that have been living with humans with generations. Dogs can be classified in several different ways. They can be classified by breed. Examples include beagles, basset hounds, poodles and countless others are defined by the American Kennel Club (AKC). They can also be classified by their role in the lives of their masters and the work they do. For example, a dog might be a family pet, a working dog, a show dog, or a hunting dog. In many cases, dogs are defined both by their breed and their roll. For example, a dog could be a beagle that is a family pet. ​</a>

Allopathy is the treatment of disease of one kind byexciting a disease of another kind or in another part. It is sometimes incorrectly used as a name for orthodox medicine or Western medicine. Homeopathy, in contrast, is a system of medicine based on the treatment of a given disease by administering small quantities of a drug which produces the symptoms of that disease in a healthy person. The treatment of illnesses, then, would be markedly dissimilar because the underlying beliefs are strongly differentiated.

1. Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into subunits, S1 and S2. S1 contains the
receptor binding domain (RBD) which allows coronaviruses to directly bind to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then likely plays a role in membrane fusion.
What is the purpose of the text?
a. explain how Covid-19 enters human cell.
b. classify the different corona virus.

                        This is a multiple‐indicators evaluation of an innovative approach, using self‐paced learning modules accompanying computerised exercises as an adjunct to teaching quantitative concepts and skills to environmental science students at university. The evaluation data, based on a pre‐unit and a post‐unit questionnaire survey completed by 38 students, show high levels of student satisfaction with the unit as a whole, and the self‐paced workbooks in particular. Students also indicated a clear preference for learning from self‐paced workbooks compared to learning from textbooks. Some students applied the quantitative skills acquired to other academic units, or took the initiative to learn to use additional statistical procedures (not covered in the unit) for academic purposes. However, comparison of students’ levels of interest and confidence in quantitative subjects before and after the completion of the unit did not yield significant changes. Implications of the research findings for university science education are discussed.<br />

Allopathy is the treatment of disease of one kind byexciting a disease of another kind or in another part. It is sometimes incorrectly used as a name for orthodox medicine or Western medicine.

_____________________________ 4. Present ideas according to the time which they occurred. The
major supporting details are arranged in sequence order to when they happened or should happen.
B. Identify its kind such as classification, explanation, enumeration and time order.
1. Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into subunits, S1 and S2. S1 contains the
receptor binding domain (RBD) which allows coronaviruses to directly bind to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then likely plays a role in membrane fusion.
What is the purpose of the text?
a. explain how Covid-19 enters human cell.
b. classify the different corona virus.

Write Classification, Enumeration, Explanation or Time order.    1. In the animal kingdom, animals are grouped according to their kinds, characteristics and behaviors. Vertebrate animals are animals with backbone. These are both warm and cold blooded animals. Invertebrate animals are animals without backbone. Animals with jointed and without legs are in this group. 2. Do you wonder how rain water is formed? The heat from the sun turns moisture (water) from plants and leaves, as well as oceans, lakes, and rivers, into water vapor (gas) which disappears into the air. This vapor rises, cools, and changes into tiny water droplets, which form clouds. When the water droplets get too large and heavy, they fall as rain. 3. There are minimum standards to follow to fight against COVID 19. These are cleaning your hands often, limiting social gatherings and time spent in crowded places, avoiding close contact with someone who is sick and coughing and sneezing in the bent elbow - not the hands. 4.

Finally, they become adult butterflies. 5. Jenny was excited joining the 5-day camp. She was chosen as a camp leader on the first day. On the second day, she headed the hiking.
