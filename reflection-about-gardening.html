                                            Why There is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods.
The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they has many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.
1. How did Luna and Mar meet? 
2. How did their relationship develop? 
3. What law did Luna and Mar violate? 
4. What punishments did they get from disobeying the law? 
5. Although not directly stated, what do you think was the immortal law about?</a>

                                            Reflective question/Situational AnalysisRoy and Roby were best friends who both came from a poor family. They were able to finish highschool despite of the hardships they encountered in life. There were times where they became helpers in a small grocery store in town, doing projects of their classmates for a small amount of money or even lunch, weeding the gardens/yards of their teachers in school, construction workers during Saturdays and sometimes even Sundays, etc. After graduation, Roby decided to continue his studies in a province's college while Roy decided to find a job. Roby's parents were very problematic when the opening of classes started as it meant loans from the barangay cooperative and relatives, double jobs for both of them as well as for Roby. If you are in Roby's position, would you decide to do the same or just like Roy, will find a job to help your family?

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5. Besides that pensive view of northwest, the opposite phase is home to big manufacturing companies, such as CDO, Uratex, San Miguel Corporation, Plastic City, Splash, among others. From there, it can be inferred that Valenzuela is a highly _____ City ChooseCommercialAgriculturalIndustrialFInancial</a>

There I'll come when I'm a man With a camel caravan;Light a fire in the gloomOf some dusty dining-room;See the pictures on the walls, Heroes fights and festivals; And in a corner find the toys Of the old Egyptian boys.​</a>

He was very happy to see thecolorful flowers.Then he saw a frog skipping and jumping.As he ran behind the frog, it jumped intothe pond.A cow was also grazing in the garden. He saw how the cow was chewing grass.A fly then came there and buzzed over the cow. The cow swung her tail tomake the fly move away. The child clapped and laughed.The boy was enjoying the beauty of nature. He said, "Nature is wonderful. Itsbeauty attracts everyone."When he saw a squirrel he ran after it and reached near the bed of roses. Hetried to pluck some of the roses, but a thorn pierced his finger. It was verypainful. The boy started crying and ran to his house.His mother asked him, "What is the matter? Why are you crying?" The boysaid, "The thorn of the rose pierced my finger while I was plucking it and nowI feel severe pain."His mother said, "It is your mistake. You should not have tried to pluck theflower. The flowers are meant to be seen and not to be plucked. Besides,natural beauty should never be harmed. One should not interfere with thenatural processes. Instead, we should help to maintain the nature."​</a>

These fruits were and still is my hobby. I diversify into citrus and Paw paw’s. Went into no spray culture.<br />Now, I am going into small tree’s, age has a lot to do with it. So persimmon makes me the happiest, for one thing, they are in the ground, no containers and beautiful ornamental trees.<br />When I look at my harvest this fall, it just make me feel great.<br />Btw, I planted 80 cloves of garlic, a excellent variety, all my hot pepper plants that I planted late are now mixed in with my citrus in my grow room under lights. Paw paw’s has been great again. Friends on this forum are great, can’t complain. Scot’s forum is the most finest and smartest set up of all of them. It cannot be Improved!!<br />

                            8. Why There is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods.
The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they has many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.
1. How did Luna and Mar meet? 
2. How did their relationship develop? 
3. What law did Luna and Mar violate? 
4. What punishments did they get from disobeying the law? 
5. Although not directly stated, what do you think was the immortal law about?</h2><br />

                            13. Reflective question/Situational AnalysisRoy and Roby were best friends who both came from a poor family. They were able to finish highschool despite of the hardships they encountered in life. There were times where they became helpers in a small grocery store in town, doing projects of their classmates for a small amount of money or even lunch, weeding the gardens/yards of their teachers in school, construction workers during Saturdays and sometimes even Sundays, etc. After graduation, Roby decided to continue his studies in a province's college while Roy decided to find a job. Roby's parents were very problematic when the opening of classes started as it meant loans from the barangay cooperative and relatives, double jobs for both of them as well as for Roby. If you are in Roby's position, would you decide to do the same or just like Roy, will find a job to help your family?

This is because I think that it's more beneficial in the long-run. You get 100% of the amount you put in. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            14. DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5. Besides that pensive view of northwest, the opposite phase is home to big manufacturing companies, such as CDO, Uratex, San Miguel Corporation, Plastic City, Splash, among others.

Reflection poem about the poem entitled Travel by Robert Louis Stevenson.TRAVELRobert Louis StevensonI should like to rise and goWhere the golden apples grow;-- Where below another skyParrot islands anchored lie,And, watched by cockatoos and goats, Lonely Crusoes building boats;--Where in sunshine reaching outEastern cities, miles about,Are with mosque and minaretAmong sandy gardens set,And the rich goods from near and farHang for sale in the bazaar;--Where the Great Wall round China goes,And on one side the desert blows,And with the voice and bell and drum,Cities on the other hum;--Where are forests hot as fire,Wide as England, tall as a spire,Full of apes and cocoa-nutsAnd the negro hunters' huts;--Where the knotty crocodile Lies and blinks in the Nile, And the red flamingo flies Hunting fish before his eyes;-- Where in jungles near and far, Man-devouring tigers are,Lying close and giving earLest the hunt be drawing near,Or a comer-by be seenSwinging in the palanquin;-- Where among the desert sandsSome deserted city stands,All its children, sweep and prince, Grown to manhood ages since, Not a foot in street or house, Not a stir of child or mouse, And when kindly falls the night, In all the town no spark of light. There I'll come when I'm a man With a camel caravan;Light a fire in the gloomOf some dusty dining-room;See the pictures on the walls, Heroes fights and festivals; And in a corner find the toys Of the old Egyptian boys.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Robert Louis Stevenson's poem "Travel" is a call to explore new places and experience different cultures.

                        <p>Gardener: My responsibility of a gardener is to maintain the beauty of plants, outdoor grounds, and trees in a garden. I perform a range of general maintenance tasks including designing, producing, renewing and preserving outside spaces. I also work on local parks, hotels, farms, and nurseries. I love how  the flowers look in my garden and when I look at the flowers I be reminded that I planted them. My responsibilities include monitoring the health of all plants and greenspaces, watering and feeding plants, trimming trees and shrubs, fertilizing and mowing lawns, weeding gardens and keeping green spaces and walkways clear of debris and litter. and that makes my job interesting.</p><p></p><p>Y/N: I really appreciate the work you have done to make our environment more heathier</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

He was very happy to see thecolorful flowers.Then he saw a frog skipping and jumping.As he ran behind the frog, it jumped intothe pond.A cow was also grazing in the garden. He saw how the cow was chewing grass.A fly then came there and buzzed over the cow. The cow swung her tail tomake the fly move away. The child clapped and laughed.The boy was enjoying the beauty of nature. He said, "Nature is wonderful. Itsbeauty attracts everyone."When he saw a squirrel he ran after it and reached near the bed of roses. Hetried to pluck some of the roses, but a thorn pierced his finger. It was verypainful. The boy started crying and ran to his house.His mother asked him, "What is the matter? Why are you crying?" The boysaid, "The thorn of the rose pierced my finger while I was plucking it and nowI feel severe pain."His mother said, "It is your mistake. You should not have tried to pluck theflower. The flowers are meant to be seen and not to be plucked. Besides,natural beauty should never be harmed. One should not interfere with thenatural processes. Instead, we should help to maintain the nature."​</h2><br />
