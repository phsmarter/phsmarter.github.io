What are some reasons for your position/opinion? ⚫What are some cases or examples that support this? Read the text below and identify the issue, the argument/s and conclusion. When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones, iPods, personal computers and the internet, it's easy to see how science (and the technology to which it leads) in woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.1. devices, pacemakers and arterial atents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions.

Then also try to imagine how life was like 10 decades ago. differences would surely be astonishing. Not long ago, many of the technologies that we are enjoying now sounded too good to be true. Often, people thought that these technologies belong to the realm of science fiction movies and novels. But what turned these technologies into a reality is the insatiable thirst for knowledge that we, humans, specifically scientists, have. It is this thirst for knowledge that drove scientists and researchers to develop a specific discipline for different scientific queries. Sometimes, these disciplines overlap and give room for a collaborative discipline. Let's consider the fields of spectroscopy and photography, The principles in these two different fields were used to create spectral imaging The same thirst for knowledge also led scientists and researchers to exert extraordinary efforts just to understand a phenomenon, a species, or a scientific event, Lake forume howa group ofresearcherstock measures to study superbolt Sometimes thisthistorie guides us in understanding possible threats to our day to day use Understanding what superbelts are can help us determine when and we they occur and prevent them from causing irreparable damage tous Our thirst for knowledge is indeed what brought us to where we right now and where we will be the future B.

                        ESSAY<p></p>Physics and technology: it's relevant to me, the society, and the future<p></p><p>Physics and technology are a <strong>fortune of help for humans especially nowadays</strong> wherein some things are being advanced and needed an assist from them. Students who are exploring should know the importance of these two, especially in their high school component. </p><p></p><p>For me, the significance of Physics is very undetermined because, without physics, <strong>most of the science topics wouldn't be possible to be taught</strong>. As physics deals with the study of chemistry, energy, biology, and anything that defines it, is a whole <strong>huge part of our science wisdom</strong>. </p><p></p><p>Technology on the other hand is the <strong>same as signified by physics</strong>. Technology, as we all know, is a very important thing especially in the condition of our nation right now wherein almost everything is required to be limited and technology helps us to communicate with each other properly. It's a very significant thing for research, communication, job hunting, and many more. This <strong>makes human life easier.</strong></p><p></p><p>Shortly, I <strong>can't imagine things without these two.</strong> Their significance is a very <strong>valuable thing for humans and our knowledge</strong>. A society without being knowledgeable about physics is too <strong>empty and so is living without technology</strong>. In the near future, I hope we'll have more knowledge about physics and be more edible when it comes to technology, I'm hoping for its advanced changes.</p><p></p><p>- Kylla &lt;3</p><br />

It has been characterized by rapid developments in information technology.</p><p></p><p>Computers have become faster, cheaper, more powerful, and smaller. Consequently, information technology has become part and parcel of lives as it is embedded in almost all the products. People are adjusting very fast to the rapid pace at which the environment is changing. That is why this essay explores the internet revolution and digital future technology.</p><p></p><p>Of course, other developments have been realized. As far as this digital revolution essay is concerned, such innovations include television, mobile phones, the world wide web, online social networking, virtual communities, music, and multimedia. So, the following essay covers the issues relating to the revolution of information and the challenges that hinder the effective development of digital technology.</p><p></p><p>History and timeline of digital technology</p><p>The invention of personal compute in the mid 20th century enhanced the invention of new technologies by converging the previous analog technology to digital format. This made it possible to make identical copies of the original and hence the ability of accessing and distributing information remotely between media.</p><p></p><p>A significant development as far as the digital revolution is concerned is the transition of music from analog to recorded digital one in they early 1980s (Hoare,1998).</p><p></p><p>The whole phenomenon behind digital revolution started with the invention of a transistor which in turn facilitated the invention of a microprocessor.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>          Computer is a part of our nowadays world. More and more we become dependent on computers. So far computers haven't overcame peoples' brains, but in the near future computers will be more intelligent than we could ever dreamed about it. </p><p></p><p>          Future computers that see will change how we use consumer electronics and computing devices at home and work. For instance, your TV could pause the show you are watching without the need for a remote control. Just by seeing you get up to go get a beer, your TV would know you're leaving the room and no longer paying attention.</p><p></p><p>         Other applications might include a set of programs that help handicapped people control their PCs and all other connected devices in the home with head or eye movements. There could also be intuitive documents that sense when students are confused by "looking" at their facial expressions. Then, a computer might retrieve some supplemental information that could help the stumped student better understand the context of what he's reading.</p><p></p><p>Computers created within the next two decades could revolve around a technology in which laser beams converge inside crystals the size of sugar cubes, forming holographic images for processing huge amounts of information. Perhaps by the year 2020, computers will revolve around new types of optical processors. These "holographic computers" might use crystals that receive and manipulate data-laden images, processing information much faster than conventional computers.Future computers will be more human oriented, knowing how to track the users' behaviors and habits, thus better serving their individual needs.        </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if I'm wrong po</p><p>hope it helps</p><p>f0ll0w and brainliest me pls</p><br />

It makes human to feel comfortable and easy to live.</p><p></p><p>From personalized computers in our pockets to self-driving cars, the world is at our fingertips today thanks to technology. Technology has advanced into many areas of our lives, making information more accessible, improving communication, changing transportation, and the list goes on.  While it is easy to sit back and benefit from a plethora of technological advancements, it is crucial we do not become blind to its effects on society.

Then also try to imagine how life was like 10 decades ago. differences would surely be astonishing. Not long ago, many of the technologies that we are enjoying now sounded too good to be true. Often, people thought that these technologies belong to the realm of science fiction movies and novels. But what turned these technologies into a reality is the insatiable thirst for knowledge that we, humans, specifically scientists, have. It is this thirst for knowledge that drove scientists and researchers to develop a specific discipline for different scientific queries. Sometimes, these disciplines overlap and give room for a collaborative discipline. Let's consider the fields of spectroscopy and photography, The principles in these two different fields were used to create spectral imaging The same thirst for knowledge also led scientists and researchers to exert extraordinary efforts just to understand a phenomenon, a species, or a scientific event, Lake forume howa group ofresearcherstock measures to study superbolt Sometimes thisthistorie guides us in understanding possible threats to our day to day use Understanding what superbelts are can help us determine when and we they occur and prevent them from causing irreparable damage tous Our thirst for knowledge is indeed what brought us to where we right now and where we will be the future B.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Background:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>Devices that manage themselves<p>When sensory data is combined with artificial intelligence techniques, data from a large number of sensors can be blended and analyzed to create a higher-level perspective of a system.</p><p></p><p>Smart connected devices will alter our lives in a variety of ways. These include everything from simple services like opening your garage door as your car approaches to completely new business prospects including services that have yet to be established and customers that have yet to be discovered. Smart gadgets, when used in conjunction with data management that is intelligent, can increase a company's productivity and profitability.</p><p></p><p>However, in order for billions of smart devices to be deployed, the cost of control ling and monitoring them must be low. The development of autonomous and self-managing gadgets is being accelerated by advances in software and communications technologies.</p><p></p><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to everything that is connected being automated and intelligent. This means that in the future, a collective intuitive behavior across a large range of devices for a wide range of applications will be conceivable. The link enables remote sensing and control of items, bridging the gap between the real and digital worlds.</p><p></p><p>Communication will evolve in a highly remarkable way over the coming years, as interaction between human beings and machines evolves to include additional experiences and senses. The internet you can feel is on the horizon.

This is very important especially nowadays that we practice social distancing. </strong></p><p></p><p>People today communicate with each other through 2D video, which is the most advanced form of communication. People will be able to join distant business meetings or family gatherings in the future by transmitting an enhanced 3D selfie. Many people, I'm sure, are looking forward to the day when they will be able to virtually attend events like Mobile World Congress, the FIFA World Cup, or the Super Bowl.</p><p></p><p>Emerging technologies in the fields of tactile internet, virtual reality, and augmented reality, all of which are aided by 5G network evolution, are demonstrating that the ability to virtually experience an event is no longer science fiction, but a viable reality, and represent a significant step forward in innovation.</p><p></p><p>The tactile internet is based on the revolutionary idea that human-machine interaction can incorporate all of our senses. Remote experiences can be a near-real-time simulation of reality using haptics (interaction including touch). However, in order to achieve such realistic remote experiences, the loop connecting robots, AI, and communications must be closed, and near-zero latency requirements must be addressed.</p><p></p><p>Virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) are predicted to become key components of the Networked Society, with the potential to disrupt the consumer electronics market.</p><p></p><p>To know more about ICT, click here</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17863601</p><p>Hope this helps! :)
