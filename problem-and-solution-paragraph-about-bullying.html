                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying causes many problems, not only for the victim, but also for the bully. Students desire a safe haven at home and school and problems with bullies lead to insecurity in the victim. Bullying should be taken seriously and teachers, administrators and parents should work together to find solutions.</p><p></p><p>Bullying can cause life-long negative psychological effects on a victim of a bully. A victim will often suffer through the abuse because he is ashamed or he doesn't believe that change will happen if he tells. He also may fear retaliation. A victim of a bully can end up fearful of others and may be unable to cope socially.</p><p></p><p>Schools can set up programs to educate all students from a young age about the dangers and effects of bullying. Try to stop the problem before it starts by setting up parameters for students when faced with bullying. Offer a safe environment for students to discuss problems they may have with another student. Set a policy related to bullying, such as required counseling for the bully and victim and a scale of disciplinary actions, such as required community service, depending on the severity of the case. Educate all teachers on how to deal with bullying in the classroom effectively through one-on-one interaction with the student, setting up meetings with parents of bullies and victims, or when and how to remove a violent bully from the classroom. Monitor areas where students have less supervision to prevent bullies from easy opportunities to bully. Encourage all students to report incidents of bullying, whether they are victims or witnesses.</p><p></p><p>pa brainliest po</p><br />

Encourage all students to report incidents of bullying, whether they are victims or witnesses.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po : )</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Problems for Victims</p><p>Bullying can cause life-long negative psychological effects on a victim of a bully. A victim will often suffer through the abuse because he is ashamed or he doesn't believe that change will happen if he tells. He also may fear retaliation. A victim of a bully can end up fearful of others and may be unable to cope socially. A victim may become withdrawn and his school work may begin to suffer. A victim may turn around and bully someone he determines to be weaker, thus perpetuating the problem.</p><p></p><p>Problems for Bullies</p><p>A bully may also have life-long issues related to bullying. The Center for Problem Oriented Policing gives some examples for why a bully turns to picking on someone weaker such as abusive influence in the home and peer group influence. If the peers of the bully agree that someone is socially different, they may encourage the bully's behavior. According to a study by the Fight Crime Organization, nearly 60 percent of boys who researchers classified as bullies in grades six through nine were convicted of at least one crime by the age of 24. The bully may be experiencing abuse at home or have problems adjusting at school so he lashes out at someone weaker.</p><p></p><p>School Solutions</p><p>Schools can set up programs to educate all students from a young age about the dangers and effects of bullying. Try to stop the problem before it starts by setting up parameters for students when faced with bullying. Offer a safe environment for students to discuss problems they may have with another student. Set a policy related to bullying, such as required counseling for the bully and victim and a scale of disciplinary actions, such as required community service, depending on the severity of the case. Educate all teachers on how to deal with bullying in the classroom effectively through one-on-one interaction with the student, setting up meetings with parents of bullies and victims, or when and how to remove a violent bully from the classroom. Monitor areas where students have less supervision to prevent bullies from easy opportunities to bully. Encourage all students to report incidents of bullying, whether they are victims or witnesses.</p><p></p><p>Parental Solutions</p><p>Parents need to have a clear understanding of what constitutes bullying and the schools bullying policies so that they can recognize the signs and take all incidents of peer abuse seriously. A parent of a bully needs to take steps to work with the child by finding out why the child is bullying and determining if the child needs professional counseling. Parents can also encourage empathy by explaining to the child what empathy is and showing the child by example. Parents can encourage their child to stand up for herself and teach her effective ways of managing anger or feelings of helplessness. Constant communication, through phone calls, notes and meetings between parents and school is necessary to prevent bullying.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS:)</p><p></p><p></p><br />

The people who bully other people are called bullies. Anybody can be bullied, even a group of people. There are many different kinds of bullying. Bullying does not always mean hitting people. It can also be things that people say. </p><p><strong>Bullying</strong> includes when people see what happens, but they don't do anything about it. When people who see bullying know what to do and they do it, they can help make a bad situation better.</p><p>It's also <strong>bullying</strong> when other people hide it from those who can help (teachers, bosses), when other people see it but ignore it, or when a person helps the bully to do it without getting in trouble.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>When someone or many people scare, abuse or dominate other person, it is called bullying. This can happen in school, office, street or at home. Such behaviour is a habit of some people and so they do it again and again. Bullying is very common for children in schools.</p><p></p><p> “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.”</p><p></p><p>Bullying can be verbal in which children make fun of others, call them by bad names, spread rumours about them. It can be physical in which they hit others or destroy their things. It can also happen on phone or computer when someone uses dirty language or send bad pictures or messages. Intentionally making someone feel alone is also bullying. Bullying is growing a lot in our society nowadays. It affects students and people badly and many times it also affects their health. One loses confidence when one is bullied. The person starts being alone and stops talking to others. It affects his studies and his health. Some children start suffering from depression and they can also commit suicide.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

There have been countless reports over the past few years of students committing suicide because they were bullied. Meanwhile, there are times when victims see no recourse but to seek revenge by serious acts of violence against the bully and instigators. As a result of bullying, people can lose their ability to love and trust, denying them the chance to experience a quality relationship later in their life. They might find themselves as a submissive partner or they may want to be completely alone. Compounding all of these problems, victims often develop eating disorders, begin to self-injure, or require extensive counseling. Social bullying can also leave people without a supportive group of friends that they can lean on and spend time with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />
