José Rizal, in full José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda, (born June19, 1861, Calamba, Philippines-died December 30, 1896, Manila), patriot,physician, and man of letters who was an inspiration tothe Philippine nationalist movement.The son of a prosperous landowner, Rizal was educated in Manila and atthe University of Madrid. A brilliant medical student, he soon committedhimself to the reform of Spanish rule in his home country, though he neveradvocated Philippine independence. Most of his writing was done in Europe,where he resided between 1882 and 1892.In 1887 Rizal published his first novel, Noli me tangere (The Social Cancer), apassionate exposure of the evils of Spanish rule in the Philippines. A sequel, Elfilibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed), established his reputation as theleading spokesman of the Philippine reform movement. He publishedan annotated edition (1890; reprinted 1958) of Antonio Morga's Sucesos delas Islas Filipinas, hoping to show that the native people of the Philippines hada long history before the coming of the Spaniards. He became the leader ofthe Propaganda Movement, contributing numerous articles to itsnewspaper, La Solidaridad published in Barcelona. Rizal's political programincluded integration of the Philippines as a province of Spain, representationin the Cortes (the Spanish parliament), the replacement of Spanish friars byFilipino priests, freedom of assembly and expression, and equality of Filipinosand Spaniards before the law.Patulong po please​</a>

THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

José Rizal, in full José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda, (born June19, 1861, Calamba, Philippines-died December 30, 1896, Manila), patriot,physician, and man of letters who was an inspiration tothe Philippine nationalist movement.The son of a prosperous landowner, Rizal was educated in Manila and atthe University of Madrid. A brilliant medical student, he soon committedhimself to the reform of Spanish rule in his home country, though he neveradvocated Philippine independence. Most of his writing was done in Europe,where he resided between 1882 and 1892.In 1887 Rizal published his first novel, Noli me tangere (The Social Cancer), apassionate exposure of the evils of Spanish rule in the Philippines. A sequel, Elfilibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed), established his reputation as theleading spokesman of the Philippine reform movement. He publishedan annotated edition (1890; reprinted 1958) of Antonio Morga's Sucesos delas Islas Filipinas, hoping to show that the native people of the Philippines hada long history before the coming of the Spaniards. He became the leader ofthe Propaganda Movement, contributing numerous articles to itsnewspaper, La Solidaridad published in Barcelona.

                            15. what did you realize about rizal law history?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>RA 1425 or the Rizal Law orders educational institutions the Philippines to offer courses about Rizal, his life and everything he did for the country.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><p>The Rizal Law, also known as RA 1425, mandates the study of Rizal's life and works, as shown in section 1. This Republic Act calls for an increased sense of nationalism from the Filipinos during a time of a dwindling Filipino identity. According to the judicial system, a republic act is a law that has already been passed and implemented. In contrast to this, a bill is merely a proposed law, in other words it may or may not be passed by the Congress. The Republic Act was signed by the President on June 12, 1956. From the notes preceding the body of the document, one may infer that the bill was originally proposed in the Legislative arm of the Philippine Republic, in the Senate and House of Representatives. According to the Official Gazette, the law was made effective thirty days after its implementation. The mere fact that the Act was passed on the date of our independence seeks to stir up a greater sense of fervor in the Filipino, to believe in their own country and national identity-who we are as a nation. It was this time when the Philippines was heavily dependent on the American government for support and guidance. Also, based on the fact that Jose Rizal is honored by the Philippines as the Philippine national hero, it is but appropriate that the document written to commemorate his accomplishments is written here, in the land of his birth.</p><p></p><p>It is Senator Claro M. Recto who authored the Rizal Bill. While Senator Jose P. Laurel, Sr., who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education, sponsored the bill in the Senate. Both of them were known for their great sense of nationalism. This nationalism served as the foundation to come up with this republic act, to set our country free from the hands of others and stand up on our own -exactly the ideals and values that Rizal strove to fight for. It was written for the Filipino people, specifically the Filipino youth, who may have lost their sense of nationalism. The writers endeavored to rekindle a lost spark in each Filipino's belief in their country. A republic act as drastic as the Rizal Law, which requires the study of Rizal's life and works-something that does not need to be required in the first place -can only be born out of the fact that Rizal and his works were not given a high priority in the educational system of the country prior to the release of this act. It is clear that the government had to make drastic changes to resolve the issue. This is evident in section 3 of the act, legalizing all forms of translations for Rizal's works, as well as section 2, obligating all schools, colleges and universities to keep an adequate number of copies of Rizal's works. This makes them more accessible to a greater audience.</p><p></p><p>It is hard to make out any form of emotion from any legal document; however, the choice of words is still able to convey a fiery passion. To highlight this, they also use words or concepts that can easily relate to the common Filipino man. Such passion is vital, as the audience is presumably of dwindling nationalism. In this regard, the writer attempts to show the audience the identity they have slowly been losing, and show them how they can undo this.</p><p></p><p>There are important points that the author cited in this republic act that is worth noticing. First, "Whereas, today, more than other period of our history, there is a need for a re-dedication to the ideals of freedom and nationalism for which our heroes lived and died." This document was written in the year 1956 during Magsasyay's regime when the country was still recovering from the Japanese occupation and still very dependent on US governance. Ideals of freedom and nationalism were very essential during those times since the Philippines was still struggling for independence, and the country was still gradually developing its national identity and integrity. During those times havoc also existed within the Filipinos since there were numerous uprisings against the Philippine government. Moreover, even though this document was written decades ago, it is still striking because this clause is very timely for this present generation when our culture is being overpowered by foreign influence and Filipino diaspora is widespread.</p><p></p><p>Another important point from RA 1425 is "Whereas, all educational institutions are under the supervision of, and subject to regulation by the.</p><br />

THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

                            26. Based on what you have learned from the history of Republic Act No. 1425 or the Rizal Law, how do you weigh the contradicting points of the authors of the law especially Sen. Claro M. Recto and that of the Catholic Church? Which among them has a valid claim over their arguments.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I believe that both Sen. Claro M. Recto and the Catholic Church have valid claims over their arguments. While it is true that the Rizal Law was created in order to promote the study and appreciation of the life, works, and writings of Jose Rizal, it is also important to remember that Rizal was a Catholic. As such, the Catholic Church has a certain amount of authority when it comes to his life and work.</p><br />
