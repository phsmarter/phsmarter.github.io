Before, an audio can be created and transmitted through tape, radio, or CD. Today, a different alternative is offered by the Internet - the podcast. You may have encountered the term in your previous lesson in Listening Strategies. It is a digital audio file that is posted on the Internet. For you to practice the guidelines in conducting an interview, interview an expert on any field (Example: teacher, nurse, engineer, etc.). Imagine you will produce a 5-minute informative podcast about your interviewee's expertise 1. First, copy and accomplish the template on "Interview Plan" in your paper. Then, provide the interviewee with a copy of the interview questions to allow him/her to prepare answers. Remember to use open-ended questions. (Example: What advice would you give someone who like to follow a similar career to yours?) Interview Plan Interviewer Purpose of interview: Interviewee:Information I know about the Interviewee: Job Position/Title: Workplace: Years in service/practice: Others: Possible Questions: 1. 2.3.4.5.Answers:1.2.3.4.5.2. If a smartphone or any sound recorder is available, you can use it to record the interview. You can use your recording to complete the last part of your Interview Plan where you will write your interviewee's answers. Remember to use a direct speech or write the exact answers of your interviewee. 3. After the interview, reflect on the questions that follow. Write your answers on your paper. ►► What was it like to interview someone? ►►Which of the tips or guidelines did you use, and how did it help you as an interviewer? ►► GOOD AND HELPFUL ANSWER = BRAINLIEST ►►NONSENSE ANSWER = REPORT!! ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During an interview, you may be asked about your work experience in past jobs. You can use this question to share a thoughtful reflection on what you need from a workplace, a supervisor and other elements of your next role.</p><p></p><p>Before your interview, prepare an answer that respectfully discusses your time in your previous position and focuses on the elements you look forward to in the one you’re interviewing for. In this article, we will discuss a few ways to answer the question,</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This question poses an opportunity for the hiring manager to know what type of work you like to do besides how good of a fit you will be if you work for the company. It can also be a way for them to gauge your experience level with certain workplace scenarios and rank your soft skills. Thus, companies want to ensure they’re hiring a culture fit and a talent fit, which is why they pay close attention to the answer to this question.</p><p></p><p>One thing to remember as you’re discussing your fitness for the company with employers is that the idea of “culture fit” can sometimes be used as a way to eliminate and discriminate against candidates, however unknowingly, who don’t think, act or look like existing employees. A better alternative concept you might consider speaking to is “culture add,” or your ability to bring fresh and additive ideas and feedback to the team. Culture adds make the company stronger by diversifying the experiences and perspectives of its workforce.</p><p></p><p>brainlist me</p><br />
