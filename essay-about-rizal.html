                        <p><strong>Answer: Jose Rizal is one of the most influential figures in Philippine history, and his works continue to have significant relevance to our time. He was a renowned nationalist, writer, and revolutionary who fought for the country's freedom against the Spanish colonial rulers. His literary works, including novels, essays, and poems, are regarded as masterpieces that inspired the Philippine Revolution.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of Rizal's most significant contributions to Philippine literature is his novel, Noli Me Tangere, which exposed the corruption and injustices of the Spanish colonial government. The book, which was published in 1887, sparked a revolution and ignited a sense of nationalism among the Filipinos. Its themes of oppression, injustice, and resistance continue to resonate with Filipinos today, who are still fighting against corruption and social inequality.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Rizal's other novel, El Filibusterismo, which was published in 1891, also had a profound impact on Philippine literature and society. The book delved deeper into the issues of colonialism and class struggle, exploring the various forms of oppression and resistance present in the Philippines at the time. It remains a powerful critique of the Philippine society's flaws and continues to be a source of inspiration for contemporary writers and social activists.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Apart from his literary works, Rizal was also a staunch advocate for education and social reform. He believed that the country's progress would depend on the education of its people and that the youth must be empowered to effect social change. His ideas on education and social reform remain relevant today as Filipinos continue to fight for access to quality education and equal opportunities for all.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In addition to his literary and social contributions, Rizal was also a revolutionary leader who fought for the country's independence. He believed that the Philippines could only achieve freedom through peaceful means, and his nonviolent approach to revolution has inspired many modern-day social activists who advocate for peaceful protests and nonviolent resistance.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Overall, Rizal's significance to our time lies in his unwavering commitment to social justice, freedom, and equality. His literary works, ideas on education, and nonviolent approach to revolution continue to inspire generations of Filipinos to fight for a better future. His life and legacy serve as a reminder of the importance of courage, perseverance, and dedication to one's ideals.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Certain values that Rizal recommends are <strong>about courage and struggle.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jose Rizal is a student figure who fights for the rights of the Filipino people.</strong> Jose Rizal opposed the Spanish government at that time because it was considered miserable for the Filipino people. Incidents of injustice experienced by his own family pushed Jose Rizal to advocate for reform in the Philippines. The reforms he demanded at that time were limited to equal rights between the Spaniards and the Filipinos.</p><p> The Philippines entered as a province of Spain, not as a colony. Jose Rizal is known as a physician, ethnologist, naturalist, artist, sculptor, novelist, and poet.<strong> Jose Rizal's struggle using peaceful means as an artist against Spain.</strong> One method of opposing Spanish colonization was to write criticism in the form of novels and poetry, such as the novel Noli Me Tangere. Jose Rizal's literary arts background was inherited from his mother, who is good at writing poetry. </p><p>The Spanish government viewed him as a rebel as a result of all of his struggles, which made them extremely dangerous. He needs to be detained and executed in exile for Spain to get rid of him. Even though Jose Rizal received a death sentence, <strong>his efforts continue to this day and have an impact on the succeeding conflicts that arise in the Philippines.</strong></p><p>The influence of Jose Rizal's struggle is the birth of the Philippine independence demands. As a result, Jose Rizal's struggle is very interesting to discuss, especially in terms of peacefully demanding reform of the Spanish government in the Philippines.<strong> This will have an impact on future reforms in the Philippines.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about history brainly.ph/question/29214943</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has had a profound impact on my understanding of Philippine history and my own identity as a Filipino.</p><p></p><p>Before studying Rizal, I had a limited understanding of the events that led to the Philippines becoming a colony of Spain, and the subsequent struggle for independence. Through reading Rizal's writings, such as "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo", I gained a deeper understanding of the injustices and oppression that the Filipino people faced during that time. Rizal's writings not only exposed the injustices and corruption of the Spanish colonial government, but also highlighted the resilience and determination of the Filipino people to fight for their rights.</p><p></p><p>Rizal's writings also helped me to better understand the Philippines' cultural identity. Rizal was a true patriot, and his works were infused with pride in the Philippines' unique culture and history. Through his writings, I learned about the customs, traditions, and beliefs of the Philippines, which helped me to appreciate my own heritage.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Rizal's writings also helped me to develop a sense of social responsibility. Rizal was not only a writer, but also a reformer who advocated for the rights of the Filipino people. His example of standing up for what is right, even in the face of oppression, has inspired me to become more engaged in the issues that affect my community and to take action to make a difference.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has changed me in many ways. It has broadened my understanding of Philippine history and culture, and has inspired me to become more socially responsible. Rizal's legacy continues to be a source of inspiration for all Filipinos, and I am proud to be a part of that legacy.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

In the primary level, they were taught of the Christian Doctrines, how to read Spanish books and a little of the native’s language.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>He who does not know how to look back at where he came from will never get to his destination.”(Jose Rizal) This quote best describes the life of this wonderful hero Jose Rizal. Born on a tiny island in the Philippines, Rizal studied under the church. Years later Rizal left to study medicine abroad, but also left for an unclear politically-related reason. He spent some of his time in Spain (which at the time occupied the Philippines with colonies) to study medicine and writing. He was a very talented writer who knew how to write in Spanish, Tagalog, German, French, English, and Italian and also knew Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. After Spain he continued traveling to see how the world treated each other. He took particular interest in the United States and how it freed itself from English rule. He wished the same would happen to save the poor and oppressed of his home land of the Philippines. He unloaded all his thoughts, feelings, and beliefs into two books that inspired the people to rise up. Jose Rizal deserves the sacred name hero because he never believed in violence to solve his problems, always helped others, and was brave beyond compare, and as a result he set an entire colony on the path of freedom.</p><p></p><br />

                            23. Argumentative essay about "Why Rizal wants the Philippines to be Free from the Spaniards?”​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines, once a prosperous nation, was subdued under the colonization of the Spanish empire for over three hundred years. During this time, the country underwent economic exploitation, social inequality, and political oppression. Jose Rizal, a prominent Filipino nationalist, had a strong desire to see the Philippines free from the Spanish colonizers. In this essay, we will examine why Rizal wants the Philippines to be free from the Spaniards.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Rizal wanted the Philippines to be free from the Spaniards because of the injustices and inequalities brought about by Spanish colonization. The Spanish government implemented policies that favored Spanish nationals, resulting in social inequality and economic exploitation of the Filipino people. Rizal witnessed firsthand the poverty and suffering of his fellow Filipinos, and he wanted to put an end to it. He believed that the Philippines deserved to be an independent nation, where Filipinos could enjoy equal rights and opportunities, without the burden of colonialism.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Rizal believed that the Philippines should be free from the Spaniards because of the suppression of Filipino culture and heritage. The Spanish colonizers tried to erase Filipino identity by imposing their own culture and language on the Filipinos. They forbade the teaching of Filipino languages and suppressed the practice of Filipino traditions and customs. Rizal believed that the Filipino people should be proud of their heritage and culture, and he fought for their right to practice their traditions and speak their languages without fear of persecution.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Rizal wanted the Philippines to be free from the Spaniards because he believed in the inherent dignity and worth of the Filipino people. He believed that Filipinos had the right to self-determination and self-governance, and that they were capable of managing their own affairs. He saw the Philippines as a nation with great potential, with the ability to thrive and prosper without the oppressive hand of the Spanish colonizers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Rizal's desire for the Philippines to be free from the Spaniards was fueled by his passion for justice, equality, and freedom. He wanted Filipinos to have the right to govern themselves, practice their own culture, and enjoy equal rights and opportunities. Rizal's legacy continues to inspire generations of Filipinos, reminding them that they are capable of great things and that they should always fight for their freedom and independence</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Firstly, Rizal saw the Spanish colonial regime as immoral and corrupt, with the colonizers exploiting and mistreating the Filipino people. The Spaniards imposed laws and social structures that favored their own interests, leaving the natives powerless and oppressed. Rizal believed in the inherent dignity and value of the Filipino people and wanted them to be free from the oppression and abuse that they had suffered under for centuries.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Rizal recognized the importance of education, enlightenment, and self-determination in achieving freedom and national identity. By advocating for the education of the masses, he empowered them with the knowledge and skills to challenge the existing power structures and work towards the creation of a new society where truths and justice prevailed. He saw the Filipinos as capable of self-governance, and believed that their freedom and prosperity could only be achieved through a process of self-determination.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Rizal’s quest for Philippine independence was rooted in his deep love for his country and his desire to see it achieve its full potential. He believed in the beauty and richness of the Philippine culture and saw the potential for the nation to be a beacon of hope and inspiration to other nations. Rizal hoped that through collective action and national pride, the Philippines could rise above the wounds of the past and create a future of greatness, prosperity, and freedom.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

There are a lot of Spaniards and Filipinos who witnessed the death of Rizal but only one Filipino, a priest who got to witness the execution of Rizal and share his feelings about it until it reaches in our generation. This essay is about Padre Faura's emotional expression about witnessing the death of Rizal.<br />(You can use this as intro, ikaw bahala)</strong><br /><br />Sa body naman, first ay ipakilala mo muna kung sino si Padre Faura, ano yung role niya bilang padre, ano yung tungkulin niya biglang padre at ano yung main reason kung bakit nandon siya sa execution at nawitness in the first place.<br /><strong>Padre Faure, a priest (and add more background details about him then end mo na yung sentence). <br /></strong>Then utay utayin mo yung magslide ka sa mga naramdaman ni Padre nung inexecute si Rizal habang kinekwento mo rin yung nagaganap before and after the execution.<br />Talk about the environment. Naging magulo ba? Madami ba nagiyakan, nagalit o natuwa pa ang mga Spaniards base on the Padre Faura's statement syempre.<br /><br />Lastly sa conclusion, mainly isusum up mo na lang yung buong introduction and body, madali na iyon. Maglagay ka ng aral na mapupulot kung maaari at dagdag din iyon.</p><p></p><p>Sa paggawa mo ng essay important na gumamit ka ng mga transitional words like therefore, however, on the other hand etc. Wag puro The, After that.

                            28. Write an essay about the student's education during the time of Rizal.​</h2><br />
                            In 1890, Rizal, 29, left Paris for Brussels as he was preparing for the publication of his annotations of Antonio de Morga's "Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas." There, he lived in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters, Catherina and Suzanna who had a niece also named Suzanna ("Thil") HistorianGregorio F. Zaide states that Rizal had "his romance with Suzanne Jacoby, 45, the petite niece of his landladies." Belgian Pros Slachmuylders, however, believed that Rizal had a romance with the niece, Suzanna Thil, in 1890. Belgian Jean Paul Verstraeten proved this. Jean Paul traced in the archives of Brussels that in the same house as Suzanne Jacoby, a little niece was living, Suzanne Till. Letters from Suzanne to Rizal were signed by "Petite Suzanne".<br /><br />Rizal's Brussels stay was short-lived, as he moved to Madrid, leaving the young Suzanna a box of chocolates. Suzanna replied in French: "After your departure, I did not take the chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of your parting. Don’t delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my for running to the mailbox to see if there is a letter from you. There will never be any home in which you are so loved as in that in Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back…" (Oct. 1, 1890 letter). The house where Rizal was staying, in Rue Philippe de Champagne 38 doesn't exist anymore following some writers. (the house numbers jump from 36 to 42). Jean Paul Verstraeten proved during his research that this house still exists, on August 10, 1900, the number of the house was changed into 42. Jean Paul traced the owner of this house and convinced her to put a historical marker. Slachmuylders’ group in 2007 unveiled this historical marker commemorating Rizal's stay in Brussels in 1890.<br /><br />The content of Rizal's writings changed considerably in his two most famous novels, Noli Me Tángere, published in Berlin in 1887, and El Filibusterismo, published in Ghent in 1891 with funds borrowed largely from Rizal's friends. These writings angered both the Spanish colonial elite and many educated Filipinos due to their insulting symbolism. They are critical of Spanish friars and the power of the Church. Rizal's friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austria-Hungary born professor and historian wrote that the novel's characters were drawn from real life and that every episode can be repeated on any day in the Philippines<br /><br /><br /><br />SANA MAKATULONG<br />

                            30. argumentative essay about the points of Rizal towards the future of the Philippines from the Spanish colonizers.</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer
</strong><p>Dr Jose Rizal's essay, "The Philippines a Century Hence" and "Filipinos is also called Dentro De Cien Anos" or "The Philippine Within One Hundred Years in English."
</p><p>
</p><p>These are my personal choices on Rizal's prediction that already happened and is happening even right now:
</p><p>  1.  Rizal foreshadowed the Filipinos winning their independence against Spain. However, the Americans would come as the new colonizer.
</p><p> 2.Deterioration and disappearance of Filipino indigenous culture – when Spain came with the military might and religion. It started the gradual removal of native Philippine culture. Hence, the Filipinos started losing confidence in their history and heritage. Many doubted their present lifestyle, and eventually lost hope in the preservation of their race and future.
</p><p>3. Passivity and submissiveness to colonizers – the Spanish friars influenced a culture of silence among the Filipinos. While the Spanish Army used force. The Filipinos felt helpless and learned to submit themselves to the will of the foreigners. This is noticeable today, especially in how our society is quickly influenced by foreign culture.<strong>
