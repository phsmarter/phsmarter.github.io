Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self Improvement Essay </p><p>written by: Hunter Lewin</p><p></p><p>Self improvement is a self-guided improvement, usually represented by the actions you can take to develop your self, and to enhance your physical, mental, spiritual, social and emotional capabilities. “Improvement of one’s condition through one’s own effort” can also be a definition for self improvement. Your subconscious mind plays a major key in self improvement. You change your habits, behavior and attitudes by changing the contents of it.</p><p></p><p>There are many aspects in self improvement; one is the physical improvement. We humans always care how we look because our physical appearance is a biological force that affects on how we deal with others. Our perception of our own attractiveness also has an effect on how we feel confident about ourselves. One way to improve your physical appearance is to getting into the habit of drinking more water. You need to be hydrated in order to have a fair, glowing skin, healthier hair and healthier body. Another way is to be always mindful of your hygiene. Do you daily routine of tasks in cleaning your body, one example is to shower once daily to avoid body odor. Getting enough sleep is another way for physical self improvement. Of course, tiredness is not attractive. You have to get 8 to 9 hours of sleep every night. Getting rid of biting you nails will also help in your improvement. Biting your nails puts lots of germs inside your mouth, this ruins your health. Also, always wear deodorants or antiperspirants. Deodorant prevents sweat from smelling and antiperspirants stops sweating altogether. Of course you want to always smell and look fresh, so this is another way for you to look good. Another way for you to look attractive is to feel confident all the time. Don’t be cocky, this really helps. Always be in proper posture to show confidence. When it comes to clothing, always choose those which compliment the shape of your body. If you don’t know how, you can consult a friend that whom you know is good with clothing. You can also ask for tips and advices. Lastly, occasionally put perfume or body sprays, but be sure not to apply too much of it. 1 to 3 sprays will do. Smell of perfumes last longer when applied on the back of the neck or on your wrist. Next aspect of self development is the mental improvement. Mental strength or toughness is not something that you have to be born with as this is something that can be developed as you grow. One way to develop your mental strength is to listen to professionals and experts of this field. There are many available biographies and audio programs that will teach you to overcome obstacle and be successful in life. Another way is to always bear in mind that failure and handicaps are not hindrances in reaching your goals in life.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>How I will improve myself with these factors affecting my attitude and behavior? Improving oneself is the best thing in your lifetime that you should do, it's not the same as changing you as a person but a factor that will help you to build self esteem and confidence. Improving may some affect your behavior but you should not worry about it (unless it affects other people) but always keep in your mind that you never change for bad but you are improving yourself for you and not for others. And always think before anything. </p><br />

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</h2><br />
