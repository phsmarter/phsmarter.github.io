A Tale of Two CitiesBy: Charles Dickens      There was a steaming mist in all the   hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding   none. A Clammy and intensely cold mist,  it slow way through the air in ripples that   visibly   followed   and   overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It  was  dense enough to shut   out   everything from the  light  of  the   coach-lamps   but these its own workings, and a few yards of  road: and  wreck  of  the   laboring  houses  steamed  into  it, as  if they had made it all.A. calmB. guiltyC. forcefulD. mysterious5. Charlotte's Webby: Anonymous     But I feel peaceful. Your success in the rain this morning   was to a small degree, my success. Your future is assured. You will live, secure and safe, Wilbur. Nothing can harm   you now. This autumn days will shorten and grow cold. The leaves will shake loose from the trees and fall. Christmas will come and the snows of winter. You will live to enjoy the beauty of the frozen world, for humane a great deal to Zuckerman and he will not harm you, ever. Winter will pass, the days will lengthen, and the ice will melt in the pasture pond. The song sparrow will return and sing, the frogs will awake, and the warm wind will blow again. All these sights and sounds and smells will be yours to enjoy, Wilbur. This lovely world, these precious days.A. happinessB. acceptanceC. mysteriousD. proud​</a>

                                            actually depends on the particular definition you are using.Luminosity is a star’s energy output per second. It does not depend on the distance to the star. Loosely speaking, luminosity is how “bright” a star really is. However, brightness has three different meanings in astronomy, as follows:a) Brightness can mean the same as luminosity, in which case it should really be referred to as intrinsic brightness.b) The second meaning is more correctly referred to as apparent brightness. It is the light energy per second per unit area detected by an observer. It is also called the star’s flux. The distance to the star is important in this case.c) Thirdly, apparent brightness can simply be another way of referring to a star’s apparent magnitude (see the Footnote below for more on apparent magnitude).Despite the detrimental impact on economies around the world, the pandemic may have been more of a game of winners and losers than some had previously assumed. Changes in customer demand, surges in online shopping and incentivised opportunities for entrepreneurs presented a more favourable business landscape for start-ups in certain industries compared to more established companies which were unable to adapt to the changing times.Undoubtedly, COVID-19 challenged businesses in more ways than one. Companies all over the world were forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviours and restructure their approach to business almost overnight. While this transformation seems to have left some behind, it is the tech-savvy, younger generation of entrepreneurs who have not only survived, but thrived as a result. You may be wondering why?Digital First ApproachOngoing lockdowns and the move to working from home resulted in a greater reliance on technology in almost every aspect of our lives, and, for a number of start-ups, this presented an opportunity for growth. Companies without the structures in place to support remote work will have felt the impact almost immediately, while newer start-ups that were more accustomed to the digital world were able to quickly adapt to the new economic environment.Similarly, businesses without an online presence would have struggled following the shift to online shopping while several EdTech, pharma and fashion e-tailer start-ups benefitted from robust digital marketing strategies, cementing themselves in hyperlocal trade and door-to-door deliveries. The crisis also became an unexpected catalyst for growth for certain industries such as delivery services, commercial cleaning and online fitness and wellness programmes that may have been previously overlooked by the average consumer.​</a>

                            10. actually depends on the particular definition you are using.Luminosity is a star’s energy output per second. It does not depend on the distance to the star. Loosely speaking, luminosity is how “bright” a star really is. However, brightness has three different meanings in astronomy, as follows:a) Brightness can mean the same as luminosity, in which case it should really be referred to as intrinsic brightness.b) The second meaning is more correctly referred to as apparent brightness. It is the light energy per second per unit area detected by an observer. It is also called the star’s flux. The distance to the star is important in this case.c) Thirdly, apparent brightness can simply be another way of referring to a star’s apparent magnitude (see the Footnote below for more on apparent magnitude).Despite the detrimental impact on economies around the world, the pandemic may have been more of a game of winners and losers than some had previously assumed. Changes in customer demand, surges in online shopping and incentivised opportunities for entrepreneurs presented a more favourable business landscape for start-ups in certain industries compared to more established companies which were unable to adapt to the changing times.Undoubtedly, COVID-19 challenged businesses in more ways than one. Companies all over the world were forced to adapt to changing consumer behaviours and restructure their approach to business almost overnight. While this transformation seems to have left some behind, it is the tech-savvy, younger generation of entrepreneurs who have not only survived, but thrived as a result. You may be wondering why?Digital First ApproachOngoing lockdowns and the move to working from home resulted in a greater reliance on technology in almost every aspect of our lives, and, for a number of start-ups, this presented an opportunity for growth. Companies without the structures in place to support remote work will have felt the impact almost immediately, while newer start-ups that were more accustomed to the digital world were able to quickly adapt to the new economic environment.Similarly, businesses without an online presence would have struggled following the shift to online shopping while several EdTech, pharma and fashion e-tailer start-ups benefitted from robust digital marketing strategies, cementing themselves in hyperlocal trade and door-to-door deliveries. The crisis also became an unexpected catalyst for growth for certain industries such as delivery services, commercial cleaning and online fitness and wellness programmes that may have been previously overlooked by the average consumer.​</h2><br />
