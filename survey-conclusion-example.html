According to recent studies by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, fewer young adults are affiliated with a specific religion than older people today. And, compared with their elders, fewer young people say that religion is very important in their lives. Yet, many young people still believe in traditional religious concepts and practices. Pew Research Center surveys show, for example, that “young adults’ beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven, hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today.” According to GSS (General Social Survey) results from a random sample of 1,679 subjects, 756 in the 18–29 age group pray daily (an increase of 5% over the 1990s), while 55% pray less often. .

Similarly, a Pew survey conducted in 2015eeting spaces for senior citizens, over a third of residentsfound that nearly two-thirds of American adults feel that closing their local library would have amajor impact on their community. People see libraries as a way to connect with others and gettheir questions answered, benefits tablets can't offer nearly as well or as easily.While replacing libraries with tablets may seem like a simple solution, it would encouragepeople to spend even more time looking at digital screens, despite the myriad issues surroundingthem. It would also end access to many of the benefits of libraries that people have come to relyon. In many areas, libraries are such an important part of the community network that theycould never be replaced by a simple object.SOURCE: https://blog.prepscholar.com/argumentative-essay-examplesComplete the following:ISSUE:CLAIM:ARGUMENT:EVIDENCE:1.2.3.COUNTERARGUMENT:REBUTTAL:CONCLUSION:sol2ware​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Survey research a research method involving the use of standardized questionnaires or interviews to collect data about people and their preferences, thoughts, and behaviors in a systematic manner. Although census surveys were conducted as early as Ancient Egypt, survey as a formal research method was pioneered in the 1930-40s by sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld to examine the effects of the radio on political opinion formation of the United States. This method has since become a very popular method for quantitative research in the social sciences.</p><p></p><p>The survey method can be used for descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory research. This method is best suited for studies that have individual people as the unit of analysis. Although other units of analysis, such as groups, organizations or dyads (pairs of organizations, such as buyers and sellers), are also studied using surveys, such studies often use a specific person from each unit as a “key informant” or a “proxy” for that unit, and such surveys may be subject to respondent bias if the informant chosen does not have adequate knowledge or has a biased opinion about the phenomenon of interest. For instance, Chief Executive Officers may not adequately know employee’s perceptions or teamwork in their own companies, and may therefore be the wrong informant for studies of team dynamics or employee self-esteem.</p><p></p><p>Survey research has several inherent strengths compared to other research methods. First, surveys are an excellent vehicle for measuring a wide variety of unobservable data, such as people’s preferences (e.g., political orientation), traits (e.g., self-esteem), attitudes (e.g., toward immigrants), beliefs (e.g., about a new law), behaviors (e.g., smoking or drinking behavior), or factual information (e.g., income). Second, survey research is also ideally suited for remotely collecting data about a population that is too large to observe directly. A large area, such as an entire country, can be covered using mail-in, electronic mail, or telephone surveys using meticulous sampling to ensure that the population is adequately represented in a small sample. Third, due to their unobtrusive nature and the ability to respond at one’s convenience, questionnaire surveys are preferred by some respondents. Fourth, interviews may be the only way of reaching certain population groups such as the homeless or illegal immigrants for which there is no sampling frame available. Fifth, large sample surveys may allow detection of small effects even while analyzing multiple variables, and depending on the survey design, may also allow comparative analysis of population subgroups (i.e., within-group and between-group analysis). Sixth, survey research is economical in terms of researcher time, effort and cost than most other methods such as experimental research and case research. At the same time, survey research also has some unique disadvantages. It is subject to a large number of biases such as non-response bias, sampling bias, social desirability bias, and recall bias, as discussed in the last section of this chapter.</p><p></p><p>Depending on how the data is collected, survey research can be divided into two broad categories: questionnaire surveys (which may be mail-in, group-administered, or online surveys), and interview surveys (which may be personal, telephone, or focus group interviews). Questionnaires are instruments that are completed in writing by respondents, while interviews are completed by the interviewer based on verbal responses provided by respondents. As discussed below, each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, in terms of their costs, coverage of the target population, and researcher’s flexibility in asking questions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps,mark me as your brainliest</p><br />

It will help you decide what counts as evidence, put evidence to work in your writing, and determine whether you have enough evidence. It will also offer links to additional resources.Many papers that you write in college will require you to make an argument; this means that you must take a position on the subject you are discussing and support that position with evidence. It’s important that you use the right kind of evidence, that you use it effectively, and that you have an appropriate amount of it. If, for example, your philosophy professor didn’t like it that you used a survey of public opinion as your primary evidence in your ethics paper, you need to find out more about what philosophers count as good evidence. If your instructor has told you that you need more analysis, suggested that you’re “just listing” points or giving a “laundry list,” or asked you how certain points are related to your argument, it may mean that you can do more to fully incorporate your evidence into your argument. Comments like “for example?,” “proof?,” “go deeper,” orexpand” in the margins of your graded paper suggest that you may need more evidence. Let’s take a look at each of these issues—understanding what counts as evidence, using evidence in your argument, and deciding whether you need more evidence.WHAT </p><p></p><p>COUNTS AS EVIDENCE?</p><p>Before you begin gathering information for possible use as evidence in your argument, you need to be sure that you understand the purpose of your assignment. If you are working on a project for a class, look carefully at the assignment prompt. It may give you clues about what sorts of evidence you will need. Does the instructor mention any particular books you should use in writing your paper or the names of any authors who have written about your topic? How long should your paper be (longer works may require more, or more varied, evidence)? What themes or topics come up in the text of the prompt? Our handout on understanding writing assignments can help you interpret your assignment. It’s also a good idea to think over what has been said about the assignment in class and to talk with your instructor if you need clarification or guidance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>WHAT MATTERS TO INSTRUCTORS?</p><p>Instructors in different academic fields expect different kinds of arguments and evidence—your chemistry paper might include graphs, charts, statistics, and other quantitative data as evidence, whereas your English paper might include passages from a novel, examples of recurring symbols, or discussions of characterization in the novel. Consider what kinds of sources and evidence you have seen in course readings and lectures. You may wish to see whether the Writing Center has a handout regarding the specific academic field you’re working in—for example, literature, sociology, or history.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>WHAT ARE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES?</p><p>A note on terminology: many researchers distinguish between primary and secondary sources of evidence (in this case, “primary” means “first” or “original,” not “most important”). Primary sources include original documents, photographs, interviews, and so forth. Secondary sources present information that has already been processed or interpreted by someone else. For example, if you are writing a paper about the movie “The Matrix,” the movie itself, an interview with the director, and production photos could serve as primary sources of evidence. A movie review from a magazine or a collection of essays about the film would be secondary sources. Depending on the context, the same item could be either a primary or a secondary source: if I am writing about people’s relationships with animals, a collection of stories about animals might be a secondary source; if I am writing about </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> true answer po</p><p></p><p>hope its helps</p><br />

These are information which are expressed in numbers. 3. These are presumptions to be computed before accepting it as true. 4. The relevance of the outcome is more important than the process of the research. 5. This is the ability of the data to be counted. 6. It denotes the unbiased representation of the total population. 7. It starts out with a general statement, or hypothesis, and examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion. 8. It is meant to provide information that is useful in reaching conclusions or decision-making. 9. The results and conclusion are based on relevant facts, not on personal perception. 10. Quantitative research focuses on a specific research problem to yield specific outcomes. o WHAT'S NEW Directions: In this part of the module, you are going to do a Picture Analysis.​</h2><br />

Americans ages 18 to 29 are considered to be less religious than older Americans. According to recent studies by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, fewer young adults are affiliated with a specific religion than older people today. And, compared with their elders, fewer young people say that religion is very important in their lives. Yet, many young people still believe in traditional religious concepts and practices. Pew Research Center surveys show, for example, that “young adults’ beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven, hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today.” According to GSS (General Social Survey) results from a random sample of 1,679 subjects, 756 in the 18–29 age group pray daily (an increase of 5% over the 1990s), while 55% pray less often. .

People see libraries as a way to connect with others and gettheir questions answered, benefits tablets can't offer nearly as well or as easily.While replacing libraries with tablets may seem like a simple solution, it would encouragepeople to spend even more time looking at digital screens, despite the myriad issues surroundingthem. It would also end access to many of the benefits of libraries that people have come to relyon.
