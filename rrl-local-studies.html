                            7. How can you make connections of RRL, variables of the study and conceptual framework of a research study?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research theory and theoretical and conceptual frameworks are often used in the language of researchers to represent similar things, but there are subtle differences in meaning - as the previous posts elude to. Research frameworks provide the knowledge and theory basis for research studies. Theoretical research frameworks represent known and tested theories. There are many ‘tried and tested’ theories that researchers can cross-reference against. Therefore, this foundational knowledge serves as a ‘frame of reference’ from which researchers can either predict or explain their study outcomes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>However, it may be that there is no theoretical framework to guide the researcher. In this case, conceptual frameworks identify single or multiple concepts that are related but remain untested. They are still useful as a frame of reference, but the degree of interpretation is looser and wider than with theoretical frameworks. Verification of an untested theory provides an area from which research problems can be derived.</p><br />

The study found that students who used their smartphones during class had lower grades on a subsequent exam compared to students who did not use their smartphones. The researchers suggested that the use of smartphones in class could distract students from the lecture material and interfere with their ability to learn.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another study by Junco and Cotten (2012) found that students who used their smartphones during class were more likely to engage in non-academic activities such as texting, checking social media, and browsing the internet.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The male ego is a concept that has been the subject of much discussion and debate throughout history, particularly within the realm of psychology. The male ego has traditionally been defined as a sense of self-worth and self-esteem that is derived from one's perceived masculinity, strength, and power. This concept has been explored in various academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, and gender studies, and has been the focus of many studies aimed at understanding its role in shaping the behavior and attitudes of men.</p><p></p><p>History:</p><p>The study of the male ego can be traced back to the work of Sigmund Freud, who posited that men are inherently driven by a desire for power and dominance, which is closely tied to their sense of masculinity. Since Freud's time, scholars and researchers have continued to explore the concept of the male ego, with many attempting to understand its origins and consequences for men's mental health and social behavior.</p><p></p><p>Research Gap:</p><p>Despite the many studies and discussions about the male ego, there is still much that is not understood about this complicated and multifaceted concept. Some researchers have pointed to the limitations of traditional models of masculinity within contemporary society, and how this may be contributing to the development of unhealthy and negative male egos. Others have argued that the male ego is a fundamental aspect of male identity and should not be understood solely in negative terms. Thus, there is a need for further research to deepen our understanding of the male ego and its relationship to a range of social and psychological factors.</p><p></p><p>Scope and Delimitation:</p><p>This study aims to examine the concept of the male ego, its historical roots and contemporary manifestations, and the ways in which it shapes the behavior and attitudes of men. The study will focus on the social and psychological factors that contribute to the development and expression of the male ego, and will explore the potential consequences of an unhealthy or negative male ego for men's mental health and well-being.</p><p></p><p>Significance of the Study:</p><p>The study of the male ego is of great importance because of its potential implications for men's health and well-being, as well as for broader social issues related to gender relations and societal attitudes toward masculinity. By deepening our understanding of the male ego, we may be able to develop more effective strategies for supporting men's mental health and creating a more equitable and just society for all.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Help me too to level up my account mark me as a brainiest thanks i hope it helps you</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Local Literature:</p><p></p><p>1. A study conducted by Arriola and Agbulos (2018) found that online entrepreneurship education can be an effective tool for enhancing the entrepreneurial skills of students. The study revealed that online learning platforms provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace and convenience, thereby improving their engagement and learning outcomes.</p><p></p><p>2. In a study by Reyes and Sandoval (2017), it was found that traditional entrepreneurship education can also be effective in improving the entrepreneurial skills of students. The study revealed that traditional learning methods, such as classroom lectures and face-to-face interactions with instructors, provide an enriching learning experience that cannot be replicated by online learning platforms.</p><p></p><p>3. A study by Garcia and Morales (2019) revealed that students who received both traditional and online entrepreneurship education had higher levels of entrepreneurial self-efficacy compared to those who only received traditional or online education. The study suggests that a combination of traditional and online learning methods can provide a more comprehensive and effective learning experience for students.</p><p></p><p>4. In a study by De Guzman and Santos (2016), it was found that the use of online learning platforms in entrepreneurship education can help address the issue of limited resources and infrastructure in traditional educational institutions. The study suggests that online learning platforms can provide students with access to a wider range of learning materials and resources, thereby improving their learning outcomes.</p><p></p><p>5. A study by Ramos and Reyes (2018) revealed that the effectiveness of traditional and online entrepreneurship education depends on the learning preferences and styles of students. The study suggests that educational institutions should consider offering a variety of learning methods to cater to the diverse needs of students.</p><p></p><p>Overall, these local studies suggest that both traditional and online entrepreneurship education can be effective in improving the entrepreneurial skills of students. However, the effectiveness of each method depends on various factors such as the learning preferences of students, the resources available, and the teaching methods employed. A combination of traditional and online learning methods may provide a more comprehensive and effective learning experience for students.</p><br />

                            24. review of related literature(RRL) Title CHALLENGES IN JOB APPLICATION AS EXPERIENCED BY FIRST-TIME JOB SEEKERS Local literature​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, the job market has become increasingly competitive, making it challenging for first-time job seekers to land a job. According to a study conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the unemployment rate among first-time job seekers in the country is at 18.6% as of 2020 (PSA, 2021).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the challenges faced by first-time job seekers is the lack of work experience. According to a survey conducted by Jobstreet Philippines, 60% of employers prefer candidates with work experience (Jobstreet, 2019). This puts first-time job seekers at a disadvantage, as they may not have the necessary skills and experience that employers are looking for.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Another challenge faced by first-time job seekers is the lack of knowledge about the job application process. A study conducted by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) revealed that many students and graduates lack knowledge on how to prepare a resume, write a cover letter, and conduct themselves during job interviews (CHED, 2019). This lack of knowledge can hinder their chances of getting hired, as employers may perceive them as unprepared or unprofessional.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has added another layer of challenge for first-time job seekers. With many companies implementing work-from-home arrangements, virtual job interviews have become the norm. This may pose a challenge for those who are not tech-savvy or do not have access to reliable internet connection.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, first-time job seekers in the Philippines face various challenges in the job application process, including the lack of work experience, knowledge about the job application process, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. To address these challenges, it is important for educational institutions and government agencies to provide training and support to help first-time job seekers navigate the job market.</p><br />
