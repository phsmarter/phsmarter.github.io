                        <p>Friendship is a divine relationship, which is defined by neither blood nor any other similarity. Friends are those you can choose for yourself in spite of the difference you both have from each other. A good friend in need will do wonders in your life, whenever you are in need of self-realization, upbringing your confidence and more.</p><p></p><p>Friendship serves you best not only in your happiest moments but also when you feel low in emotions. A life without a good friend is not at all complete and an emptiness will be felt all the time you think of sharing your emotion that can’t be told to anyone else.</p><p></p><p>To maintain and keep going with a good deep friendship, honesty is the most important factor. You should choose a person who can be cent percent honest with you in all perspective like emotions, decision making, etc. Trustworthy friendship will help you to take better decisions and choose a better path for your future well-being.</p><p></p><p>Tolerance and patience with each other are another important characteristics of long-lasting friendship. Accepting the differences, friends should be able to be with each other in all situations. As a friend, the person should lead the other to success by being a motivation and criticize the person if they choose the wrong path.</p>In short, true friendship is what gives us reason to stay strong in life. Having a loving family and all is okay but you also need true friendship to be completely happy. Some people don't even have families but they have friends who're like their family only. Thus, we see having true friends means a lot to everyone.<p></p><p></p><strong>FRIENDSHIP </strong><strong>ALSO </strong><strong>MATTERS</strong><strong>.</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Teaching oral communication in schools is becoming more infrequent. The importance of oral communication should be no different than the necessity of math, reading, or writing. Oral communication by definition is communication by word of mouth. Children must be confident in their speaking abilities because many careers require this skill. Schools must reconsider how important it is to promote oral communication, examine why it has been limited in schools, and learn how to teach it more effectively. Oral communication skills are a necessity that every child will need as an adult.</p><p></p><p>Oral communication is an important skill because it promotes leadership and confidence. When children are confident in their abilities they will succeed academically and socially. It is important for students to generate their own ideas using outside references in the community (Joseph and Efron, pg 5-6). Oftentimes some students have trouble making friends. If they can learn to be more confident in their speaking abilities they will be more likely to approach their peers. On the other hand, when students feel comfortable expressing their ideas in front of people they will most likely contribute more to class discussions. Teachers always have difficulty with getting their students to participate constructively, so if the teacher spends more time teaching their students how to talk and respond coherently children will be more likely to contribute.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>hope it helpspa brainliest po<br />

The lessons have become complex, the teachers are very, very different from the teachers of the past year and just the whole atmosphere of the subject and how the students react to it has greatly changed this year. Yes, we could say that some students aren’t interested in the subject but the students who really listen to the topics religiously have learned a lot from the subject. </p><p><strong>Ever since my first year, this year of TLE has been the best not only because of the teachers, but also because of the lessons tackled to us.</strong> We first started learning programming; it was very difficult and confusing at first but when you get used to the formulas and the patterns, it will be apiece of cake. These topics will test students’ mental intelligence and basic mathematical skills. This will help us in our future endeavors that involve programming objects especially now with the evolving technology. In the second assessment, we talked about entrepreneurship and this trained us how to start a successful business and the factors you need to start one. </p><p><strong>This is very helpful especially in the Accountancy, Business and Management career track because it gives them a glimpse of how their life will be if ever they choose to be businessmen in the future</strong>. Lastly in the third assessment, we discussed about e-commerce and online marketing. This teaches the students how to be practical and how to establish and maintain an online blog or an online shop. This proved to us that this kind of marketing is very effective in this generation especially now that most people are streaming on the internet. </p><p><strong>These lessons are really great aids for us and when we grow older and when we have our own professions</strong>.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In human culture, faith is an almost universal organization. It is contained, past and present, in all societies. All of the pre-literate cultures we encounter have religion. Religion goes back to the beginning of its own history. It is an organization which is very old. Without faith, no pagan culture remains. Religion is concerned with human beings' common values and behaviors. It is the human reaction to those elements which are beyond their ordinary understanding in the life and world of humanity. Religion is social pre-eminently and is present in almost all cultures. People in religion assume that there is an all-powerful high force that is the reasoning behind everything that occurs. Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are the three major religions, and what they all share in common beliefs is only one true God, and in whom he has created all. Religion may also be the very strong conviction that science is the explanation for humanity, called Scientology, and everything beyond it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The balikbayan box is an iconic part of Filipino culture. It is a large box filled with goods and gifts that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) send to their loved ones back home. These boxes are usually sent during holidays or special occasions and serve as a tangible reminder of the OFW's love and sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>The balikbayan box is not just a box of material possessions, but it is also a representation of the deep connection between the OFW and their family. It symbolizes the hardships and sacrifices that OFWs endure while working abroad to provide for their loved ones back home. These boxes contain items that range from simple everyday goods to luxury items, all chosen with care and affection.</p><p></p><p>The balikbayan box also plays a significant role in the Philippine economy. According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, remittances from OFWs account for around 10% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The balikbayan box is a vital part of these remittances, and its contents help support local businesses and stimulate the economy.</p><p></p><p>Despite its significance, the balikbayan box has faced some challenges, including stricter regulations on its contents and shipping. However, it remains an essential part of Filipino culture and a testament to the love and sacrifices of OFWs.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the balikbayan box is more than just a box of goods; it is a representation of the love and sacrifice of OFWs for their families. It serves as a vital lifeline for many Filipinos back home and plays a significant role in the Philippine economy. The balikbayan box is a testament to the resilience and determination of the Filipino people and will continue to be a significant part of Filipino culture for generations to come.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A balikbayan box is a package filled with goods and personal items sent by overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) to their families and loved ones back home in the Philippines. The term "balikbayan" literally means "returning home," and the box is a tangible expression of the OFW's love and affection for their families.</p><p></p><p>The balikbayan box has become an important part of Filipino culture, symbolizing the sacrifice and hard work of OFWs who are working abroad to provide a better life for their families. The contents of the box can range from simple household items like soap, canned goods, and clothing to luxury items like electronics and designer clothes.</p><p>Sending a balikbayan box is not just about sending material goods, but also about staying connected with loved ones back home. For OFWs, the box is a way to show their families that they are thinking of them and that they care, even though they are far away.</p><p></p><p>The balikbayan box also has economic significance for the Philippines, as the influx of these packages provides a boost to the country's economy. The government has even declared the balikbayan box as tax-free, recognizing its importance as a means of support for families and a source of revenue for the country.</p><p></p><p>However, there have been concerns about the misuse of the balikbayan box system, with some individuals using it to smuggle contraband or evade taxes. To address these issues, the government has implemented stricter regulations and guidelines for the sending and receiving of balikbayan boxes.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, the balikbayan box remains a beloved tradition among Filipinos all over the world. It serves as a reminder of the strong family ties and sense of community that characterize Filipino culture, and a symbol of the resilience and perseverance of OFWs who work hard to support their families and build a better future for themselves and their loved ones.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Heavily shaken by the corona pandemics many of us are currently thinking about how we could contribute to overcome this unprecedented situation. The COVID-19 crisis not only challenges disease control and crisis management, but may also have long-term and far-reaching impacts on states, societies and international cooperation. There are increasing indications that the world will look different after the crisis and that globalization will be questioned in many areas. According to these observations, the COVID-19 crisis would mark a turning point. In times of deep uncertainty, science is asked to look to the future and to flank a rational discourse about how to react to the current global crisis, and therefore now better cope with other tantamount global challenges such as the climate change.</p><p></p><p>Since this challenge is genuinely interdisciplinary, Institutes for Advanced Studies are rich pools to fish for visionary ideas and scientific observations. We are very happy that a number of distinguished and young scholars from different fields and countries agreed to write short essays on how the world will change and how it should change. The pieces will be posted bit by bit, two texts per week. Since science and art make a good couple in developing a good sensorium for tectonic shifts we also asked the comic artist Oliver Grajewski to complement and contrast the academic way of thinking. He will deliver one short comic series each week.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>matolog</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ka baby ko yan wala nang iba </p><br />

                            21. essay 250 words mass promotion​</h2><br />
                        Mass promotion is a controversial topic in education that has been debated for years. It is a policy that involves promoting all students to the next grade level, regardless of their academic performance. The idea behind mass promotion is to prevent students from being held back and falling behind their peers. However, this policy has both advantages and disadvantages.  <br /><br />One of the advantages of mass promotion is that it can help to prevent students from feeling discouraged and demotivated. When students are held back, they may feel like failures and lose confidence in their abilities. Mass promotion can help to prevent this by allowing students to move forward with their peers and continue to progress academically.  <br /><br />Another advantage of mass promotion is that it can save time and resources for schools. When students are held back, they require additional support and resources to catch up with their peers. Mass promotion can help to reduce the need for these resources and allow schools to focus on other areas of improvement.  <br /><br />However, mass promotion also has its disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that it can lead to a lack of accountability for students and teachers. When students are promoted regardless of their academic performance, there is less pressure on them to work hard and improve. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a decline in academic standards.  <br /><br />Another disadvantage of mass promotion is that it can lead to a lack of preparedness for higher education or the workforce. When students are promoted without meeting academic standards, they may not have the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in higher education or the workforce.  <br /><br />In conclusion, mass promotion is a policy that has both advantages and disadvantages. While it can help to prevent students from feeling discouraged and save time and resources for schools, it can also lead to a lack of accountability and preparedness for higher education or the workforce. It is important for schools to carefully consider the potential consequences of mass promotion before implementing this policy.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mass promotion is a controversial topic in the education sector, as it involves the promotion of students to the next grade level, regardless of their academic performance. This practice has been implemented in many schools and educational systems around the world, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many schools were forced to close and shift to online learning.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary arguments for mass promotion is that it can help prevent students from falling behind in their studies and potentially dropping out of school. By promoting students to the next grade level, they can continue their education without interruption, even if they struggled with the previous year's curriculum. This can be particularly important for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not have access to the same resources and support as their peers.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, opponents of mass promotion argue that it can lower academic standards and lead to a lack of accountability and motivation among students. If students know that they will be promoted regardless of their academic performance, they may not feel as motivated to work hard and may not develop the necessary skills and knowledge for future success.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the decision to implement mass promotion should be based on a careful evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of the practice, as well as the specific needs and circumstances of each school and student population. While mass promotion may be a useful tool in certain situations, it should not be seen as a substitute for effective teaching and learning, or for individualized support and intervention for struggling students.</p><br />

Many plant and animal species go extinct due to human activity.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poetry: Poetry And The Functions Of Poetry </p><p>Poetry (the Greek word means something made or created) is an art form in which human language is used for its aesthetic qualities in addition to, or instead of, its notional and semantic content. It consists largely of oral or literary works in which language is used in a manner that is felt by its user and audience to differ from ordinary prose.</p><p>It may use the condensed or compressed form to convey emotion or ideas to the reader's or listener's mind or ear; it may also use devices such as assonance and repetition to achieve musical or incantatory effects. Poems frequently rely for their effect on imagery, word association, and the musical qualities of the language used. </p><p>Halliday (1970: 140 ff) defined the functions of language in terms of their linguistic representations: ideational, interpersonal, and textual function.</p><p>In the ideational function, language serves for the expression of the content. In the interpersonal function, language serves to establish and maintain social relations, for example, in asking questions or answering them. The textual function is a typically linguistic function, whereby language serves to create texts through various linking devices such as anaphoric words (that, which, etc.), conjunctions, and elliptical forms of responses such as ‘Yes! Well!’ etc.</p><p>Although poetry evokes many varying opinions among high school students, I believe poetry should be taught in public schools because it is important to learn different types of writing in English, poetry is a way of self-expression, and some students end up loving poetry.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Poetry (Greek word means something made or created) is an art form in which human language is used for its aesthetic qualities in addition to, or instead of, its notional and semantic content. It consists largely of oral or literary works in which language is used in a manner that is felt by its user and audience to differ from ordinary prose.</p><p></p><p>It may use condensed or compressed form to convey emotion or ideas to the reader's or listener's mind or ear; it may also use devices such as assonance and repetition to achieve musical or incantatory effects. Poems frequently rely for their effect on imagery, word association, and the musical qualities of the language used. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Poetry has played an important role during wartimes, whether it be to inspire and unify a nation or to memorialise and remember those who fought. Australian poets throughout history such as Banjo Paterson have responded to the events and consequences of war in order to engage their audience to consider the themes of honour and sacrifice which can be seen in his patriotic 1915 poem We’re all Australians now.

One day in school, I was putting my books into the desk and hit my breast on the desk. The pain I felt that day was not like any ordinary pain that I had ever felt before. I started thinking okay this will go away in a little while, and I left it alone after that. After a couple of days, the pain did resolve itself, but now there was a lump in my left breast. I was afraid, and had no idea who I could tell. Both my parents were busy at work, and I knew they would not have time to take me to the doctor. Instead I told my grandmother. "MA! Can you come here I want to show you something", I said. She entered the room and said, "Why are you yelling in the house and what?" I told her about the lump, and she looked at me and laughed "Silly girl, you are just getting breasts now, no more boy chest for you" she said laughing, it was a sign of relief to hear her say that.</p><p></p><p>After a while the same pain came back and so did the lump. This time, it was different my left breast was a bright red color and it was hot to the touch and the lump was there. I knew this was not my breast growing I knew something had to be wrong with me. When the thought of cancer popped in my head, I ran and told my mom, who later rushed me to the hospital. When we got to the hospital, the wait was making me sick in the inside. All I wanted to know was did I have cancer at twelve and why me? When we finally got to the back and were able to talk to the doctor, he said that it was "inflammation" me I did not understand that but, I knew it wasn't cancer.
