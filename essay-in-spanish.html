For example, a verb ending in a consonant, such as the p in the word jump, would only need an -ed ending to change its tense. The verb smile ends in an e vowel that is silent, and so you only need to add a -d ending to change it tense.May 5, 2019</strong><strong>There are several different verb types in Spanish, including transitive verbs, intransitive verbs, pronominal verbs, reflexive verbs, and reciprocal verbs.</strong><strong>Le and les are the indirect object pronouns of Spanish, but they are sometimes used in situations where English uses direct objects. Verbs used to indicate that something gives pleasure or displeasure often use le.

                            5. EssayWas the Spanish colonization of our country carried out with the Spanish interests or the best interests of the Filipino people in mind? Explain your answer with factual and historical evidence.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Spanish colonization of the Philippines, which lasted for more than three centuries, was characterized by a complex interplay of Spanish interests and the interests of the Filipino people. While the Spanish authorities claimed that they were colonizing the Philippines for the good of the Filipinos, it is clear that the primary motivation behind the colonization was the expansion of Spanish empire and the acquisition of wealth and resources.</p><p></p><p>The Spanish colonial government exploited the resources of the Philippines, primarily through the encomienda system and forced labor. Under this system, Spanish officials granted land to Spanish colonizers, who in turn forced the indigenous population to work on the land for little or no pay. This practice was extremely exploitative, and it led to the exploitation of the native population, who were forced to work under inhumane conditions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Spanish authorities sought to suppress the native culture and religion of the Philippines in favor of Catholicism and Spanish culture. The Spanish colonial government imposed their own language, customs, and religion on the native population, leading to the suppression and erasure of the indigenous culture and traditions.</p><p></p><p>The Spanish also introduced slavery to the Philippines, which led to the mistreatment and exploitation of millions of Filipinos. The Spanish colonizers brought African slaves to the Philippines, where they were forced to work on plantations and mines. This practice continued for centuries and had a devastating impact on the lives of the slaves and their descendants.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it is also true that Spanish colonization brought about certain positive changes in the Philippines, such as the introduction of new technologies, education, and healthcare. Spanish influence on Philippine culture and language is still evident today, and many Filipinos still practice Catholicism, which was introduced by the Spanish.</p><p></p><p>However, overall, it is clear that the Spanish colonization of the Philippines was carried out primarily for the benefit of the Spanish, and not for the best interests of the Filipino people. The exploitation, enslavement, and suppression of the native population were all part of the larger colonial project of expanding Spanish empire and acquiring wealth and resources. While there were certainly some positive outcomes of Spanish colonization, they were ultimately outweighed by the negative impact that colonization had on the lives and well-being of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa Brainliest Po kung Tama </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Spanish colonial motives were not, however, strictly commercial.

History of Manila City 
- Spanish Period 
- American Period</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, has a rich and diverse history that spans several centuries and various cultural influences.</p><p></p><p>During the Spanish period, which lasted from the 16th century to the late 19th century, Manila was a major center of Spanish colonial rule in Southeast Asia. The city was founded by Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi in 1571, and was subsequently used as a base for Spanish exploration and expansion throughout the Philippines. The Spanish also built a number of important institutions in Manila, including the University of Santo Tomas, which is the oldest university in Asia, and the San Agustin Church, which is the oldest stone church in the Philippines. Additionally, Manila became an important port city, with trade connections to Mexico, China, and other parts of Asia.</p><p></p><p>In 1898, following the Spanish-American War, the Philippines was ceded to the United States. This marked the beginning of the American period in Manila, which lasted until 1946. During this time, the United States invested heavily in the city, building infrastructure and institutions such as schools, hospitals, and government buildings. They also introduced new technologies and modernized the city. Additionally, American influence can be seen in the introduction of American-style education, as well as the widespread use of the English language.</p><p></p><p>The American period ended with the Philippines gaining independence in 1946. Manila continues to be a major center of culture, politics, and commerce in the Philippines, and its history continues to shape the city and its people today.</p><br />

</p><p>For over 18 years I have been passionate about taking pictures. It’s been my hobby and pastime. Now, I have decided to create my own corner of cyberspace to share my love of photography. My childhood consisted of a fascination of watching the environment and that's how I love to spend my time to take a snapshots. Photography is my complete existence. I spend countless hours looking at every book and image. There is nothing in my life except photography. We all have creative abilities; I was raised with no exposure to art and grew up believing that I had no talent. As for processing, I spend hours on each image until I am happy with the results.

                            12. write your reflection essay about pre-spanish literature?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PHILIPPINE MEDIA AND LITERATURE  DURING THE PRE-SPANISH ERA
</p><p>
</p><p>The following are accounts of existence and developments of Philippine literature from the Pre-Spanish Colonization:
</p><p>
</p><p>The Start of Recorded History
</p><p>
</p><p>The end of Philippine prehistory is April 21 900 AD, the date inscribed in the oldest Philippine document found so far, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription. From the details of the document, written in Kawi script, the bearer of a debt, Namwaran, along with his children Lady Angkatan and Bukah, are cleared of a debt by the ruler of Tondo. From the various Sanskrit terms and titles seen in the document, the culture and society of Manila Bay was that of a Hindu-Old Malay amalgamation, similar to the cultures of Java, Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra at the time. There are no other significant documents from this period of pre-Hispanic Philippine society and culture until the Doctrina Christiana of the late 16th century, written at the start of the Spanish period in both native Baybayin script and Spanish. Other artifacts with Kawi script and baybayin were found, such as an Ivory seal from Butuan dated to the early 11th century and the Calatagan pot with baybayin inscription, dated to the 13th century.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the years leading up to 1000 CE, there were already several maritime societies existing in the islands but there was no unifying political state encompassing the entire Philippine archipelago. Instead, the region was dotted by numerous semi-autonomous barangays (settlements ranging in size from villages to city-states) under the sovereignty of competing thalassocracies ruled by datus, rajahs or sultans or by upland agricultural societies ruled by “petty plutocrats”. States such as the Kingdom of Maynila, the Kingdom of Taytay in Palawan (mentioned by Pigafetta to be where they resupllied when the remaining ships escaped Cebu after Magellan was slain), the Chieftaincy of Coron Island ruled by fierce warriors called Tagbanua as reported by Spanish missionaries mentioned by Nilo S. Ocampo, Namayan, the Dynasty of Tondo, the Confederation of Madyaas, the rajahnates of Butuan and Cebu and the sultanates of Maguindanao and Sulu existed alongside the highland societies of the Ifugao and Mangyan. Some of these regions were part of the Malayan empires of Srivijaya, Majapahit and Brunei.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Kingdom of Tondo
</p><p>
</p><p>Since at least the year 900, the thalassocracy centered in Manila Bay flourished via an active trade with Chinese, Japanese, Malays, and various other peoples in East Asia. Tondo thrived as the capital and the seat of power of this ancient kingdom, which was led by kings under the title “Lakan” and ruled a large part of what is now known as Luzon from or possibly before 900 AD to 1571. During its existence, it grew to become one of the most prominent and wealthy kingdom states in pre-colonial Philippines due to heavy trade and connections with several neighboring nations such as China and Japan. In 900 AD, the lord-minister Jayadewa presented a document of debt forgiveness to Lady Angkatan and her brother Bukah, the children of Namwaran. This is described in the Philippine’s oldest known document, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription.
</p><p>
</p><p>Other facts:
</p><p>
</p><p> An Indigenous form of communication was already in existence evidenced by writings on barks and bamboos. News were also announced by an umalokohan or the town crier.
</p><p> Literature was already developing: forms included sabi, (maxim), bugtong (riddle), darangan (epic poetry), kumintang (war songs), and hudhud (wedding song).
</p><p>Historical Background
</p><p>
</p><p>Long time before the Spaniards and other foreigners landed on Philippine shores, our forefathers already had their own literature stamped in the history of our race. Our ancient literature shows our customs and traditions in everyday life as traced in our folk stories, old plays and short stories. Our ancient ancestors also had their own alphabet which was different from that brought by the Spaniards. The first alphabet used by our ancestors was similar to that of the Malayo-Polynesian alphabet. Whatever records our ancestors left were either burned by the Spaniards friars in the belief that they were works of the devil or were written on materials that easily perished, like the barks of trees, dried leaves and bamboo cylinders which could not have remained undestroyed even if efforts were made to preserve them. Other records that remained showed folk songs that proved the existence of a native culture truly our own. Some of these were passed on byword of mouth till they reached the hands of some publishers or printers who took interest in printing the manuscripts of the ancient Filipinos. The Spaniards who came to the Philippines tried to prove that our ancestors were really fond of poetry, songs, stories, riddles and proverbs which we still enjoy today and which serve to show to generations the true culture of our people.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As I stumbled upon a mysterious portal, I could not help but be curious about where it would lead me. And to my amazement, I found myself transported back in time to the period when the Philippines was still under Spanish colonization. As I explored my surroundings, I couldn't help but think about the impact of the decisions made during this period, particularly in Philippine politics.</p><p></p><p>If I had the power to change one thing that affected Philippine politics during this period, I would alter the way the Spanish colonial authorities treated the native Filipinos. Instead of treating them as subordinates, I would encourage a more equitable and respectful relationship between the Spanish and Filipinos. By doing so, I believe that the Philippines could have avoided centuries of oppression and exploitation, which ultimately led to numerous social and political issues.</p><p></p><p>The Spanish colonization period in the Philippines was characterized by a power imbalance between the colonizers and the colonized. The Spanish authorities held almost complete control over the Filipinos, including their resources, culture, and governance. This led to a great divide between the two groups, with the Filipinos often marginalized and excluded from political and economic decision-making.</p><p></p><p>By fostering a more equitable relationship between the Spanish and Filipinos, the latter could have been given more agency in shaping their own society. They would have been able to participate more fully in political processes and work towards their own goals and objectives. This, in turn, could have led to greater unity and collaboration between the two groups, ultimately leading to a more stable and prosperous society.</p><p></p><p>Of course, changing the course of history is easier said than done, and there are numerous challenges that would need to be addressed. However, the potential benefits of a more equitable and respectful relationship between the Spanish and Filipinos are too significant to ignore. If I had the power to change one thing that affected Philippine politics during this period, it would be to encourage a more equitable and respectful relationship between the two groups. Only then can we truly begin to address the social and political issues that continue to affect the Philippines today</p><br />

                        <strong>Answer
</strong><p>Dr Jose Rizal's essay, "The Philippines a Century Hence" and "Filipinos is also called Dentro De Cien Anos" or "The Philippine Within One Hundred Years in English."
</p><p>
</p><p>These are my personal choices on Rizal's prediction that already happened and is happening even right now:
</p><p>  1.  Rizal foreshadowed the Filipinos winning their independence against Spain. However, the Americans would come as the new colonizer.
</p><p> 2.Deterioration and disappearance of Filipino indigenous culture – when Spain came with the military might and religion. It started the gradual removal of native Philippine culture. Hence, the Filipinos started losing confidence in their history and heritage. Many doubted their present lifestyle, and eventually lost hope in the preservation of their race and future.
</p><p>3. Passivity and submissiveness to colonizers – the Spanish friars influenced a culture of silence among the Filipinos. While the Spanish Army used force. The Filipinos felt helpless and learned to submit themselves to the will of the foreigners. This is noticeable today, especially in how our society is quickly influenced by foreign culture.<strong>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sobre la indolencia de los filipinos is a socio-political essay published in La solidaridad in Madrid in 1890. It was written by José Rizal as a response to the accusation of Indio or Malay indolence. He admits the existence of indolence among the Filipinos, but it could be attributed to a number of reasons. He traces its causes to factors such as the climate and social disorders. He defends the Filipinos by saying that they are by nature not indolent, because in fact, even before the arrival of Spaniards, Filipinos have been engaged in economic activities such as agriculture and trade. Indolence therefore has more deeply rooted causes such as abuse and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>-SANA MAKATULONG :-)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jose Rizal promoted Filipino consciousness and identity in Spanish. One of the most important themes in developing nationalism was the novels Noli Me Tangier and El Filibusterso, which exposed the abuse of the colonial government and the clergy from the peninsula. The notoriety of the novels further enhanced their popularity among Filipinos. It is forbidden to read the peninsula in the Philippine Islands as it has been exposed and mocked.</p><p></p><p>Indeed a continuation of the Noli, the El Filibusterismo exposes the real picture of Filipino society at the hands of the Spanish authorities. Socio-political issues mentioned in the Noli are also dealt with in its sequel: the abuses and hypocrisy of the members of the Spanish Catholic clergy, superstitions disguising as religious faith, the need for reform in educational system, the exploitation and corruption of government officials, and the pretenses of some social-climbing Filipinos and Spaniards.</p><p></p><p>For more information about Spanish, click here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/774692</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                            26. write an essay discussing the monetary system of the philippines from the pre-spanish regime to the post-war period​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The monetary system of the Philippines has undergone significant changes throughout its history, starting from the pre-Spanish regime up to the post-war period. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish colonizers, the Philippines had a barter system where goods and services were exchanged for other goods and services. The barter system was replaced by the use of gold, silver and copper coins known as piloncitos, which were used by the pre-colonial Filipinos in their trade and economic activities.</p><p></p><p>When the Spanish colonizers arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, they introduced the use of the Spanish peso, which became the official currency of the Philippines. The Spanish peso was divided into 8 reales, which was further divided into 100 centavos. The Spanish peso was used for more than 300 years, until the United States of America took control of the Philippines in 1898.</p><p></p><p>After the Philippines became a colony of the United States, the US dollar was introduced as the official currency. The US dollar was divided into 100 cents, and was used in the Philippines until the end of World War II.</p><p></p><p>After the war, the Philippines became an independent nation and in 1949, the Philippine peso was re-introduced as the official currency. The Philippine peso was divided into 100 centavos, and was pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 2 pesos to 1 dollar. However, the value of the Philippine peso gradually declined due to economic and political instability, resulting in the government's decision to float the peso in the early 1990s.</p><p></p><p>Today, the monetary system of the Philippines is based on the Philippine peso, which is divided into 100 centavos. The Central Bank of the Philippines, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, is responsible for the issuance, regulation and control of the country's money supply. The monetary system of the Philippines is supported by a robust banking system and a stable economy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the monetary system of the Philippines has undergone significant changes throughout its history, from the pre-colonial barter system to the use of various currencies such as the Spanish peso, US dollar, and the Philippine peso. The current monetary system is supported by a stable economy and a robust banking system, which helps to maintain economic stability and growth in the country.</p><br />

History of Manila city
- Spanish period
- American Period
Why is there a need to study history of each period ?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, has a rich history that spans over several centuries. During the Spanish period, which lasted from 1565 to 1898, Manila became the center of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. It was during this time that the city underwent significant changes in terms of architecture, culture, and society. The Spanish built grand churches and government buildings, many of which still stand today, and introduced Christianity and the Spanish language to the local population.</p><p></p><p>The American period began in 1898, following the Spanish-American War, in which the United States defeated Spain and took control of the Philippines. The Americans brought with them new ideas, technologies, and institutions, which greatly impacted the development of Manila and the Philippines as a whole. They also introduced a new system of government and education, which laid the foundation for the modern Philippines.</p><p></p><p>There is a need to study the history of each period because it helps us understand how Manila and the Philippines have evolved and developed over time. It also helps us understand the different cultural and societal influences that have shaped the city, and how these influences have contributed to the formation of Manila's unique identity. Additionally, studying history allows us to better appreciate the achievements and contributions of the people who have lived and shaped Manila in the past, and to learn from their experiences and mistakes. Furthermore, it can give us a better understanding of the Philippines' past and how it has shaped the country we know today.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: studying the history of Manila, especially during the Spanish and American periods, is crucial in understanding the cultural, societal and political influences that have shaped Manila and the Philippines. It can also help us appreciate the achievements and contributions of the people who have lived and shaped Manila in the past and to learn from their experiences and mistakes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

How important the Propaganda Movement and the La Solidaridad in the quest of Filipino Freedom and Independence from the Spanish administration?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Propaganda Movement, reform and national consciousness movement that arose among young Filipino expatriates in the late 19th century. Although its adherents expressed loyalty to the Spanish colonial government, Spanish authorities harshly repressed the movement and executed its most prominent member, José Riza</p><p><strong>Explanation:In 1888 Filipino expatriate journalist Graciano López Jaena founded the newspaper La Solidaridad in Barcelona. Throughout its course, La Solidaridad urged reforms in both religion and government in the Philippines, and it served as the voice of what became known as the Propaganda Movement. One of the foremost contributors to La Solidaridad was the precocious José Rizal y Mercado. Rizal wrote two political novels—Noli me tangere (1887; Touch Me Not) and El filibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed)—which had a wide impact in the Philippines. López Jaena, Rizal, and journalist Marcelo del Pilar emerged as the three leading figures of the Propaganda Movement, and magazines, poetry, and pamphleteering flourished.</strong></p><p></p><br />
