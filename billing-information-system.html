                                            Ann Ellis is a systems analyst at CyberStuff, a large company that sells computer hardware and software via telephone, mail order, and the internet. CyberStuff processes several thousand transactions per week on a three-shift operation and employs 50 full-time and 125 part-time employees. Lately, the billing department has experienced an increase in the number of customer complaints about incorrect bills. During the preliminary investigation, Ann learned that some CyberStuff representatives did not follow established order entry procedures. She feels that with more information, she might find a pattern and identify a solution for the problem. Ann is not sure how to proceed. She came to you, her supervisor, with two separate questions. First, is a questionnaire the best approach, or would interviews be better? Second, whether she uses interviews, a questionnaire, or both techniques, should she select the participants at random, include an equal number of people from each shift, or use some other approach? As Ann's supervisor, what would you suggest, and why?​</a>

                            8. Ann Ellis is a systems analyst at CyberStuff, a large company that sells computer hardware and software via telephone, mail order, and the internet. CyberStuff processes several thousand transactions per week on a three-shift operation and employs 50 full-time and 125 part-time employees. Lately, the billing department has experienced an increase in the number of customer complaints about incorrect bills. During the preliminary investigation, Ann learned that some CyberStuff representatives did not follow established order entry procedures. She feels that with more information, she might find a pattern and identify a solution for the problem. Ann is not sure how to proceed. She came to you, her supervisor, with two separate questions. First, is a questionnaire the best approach, or would interviews be better? Second, whether she uses interviews, a questionnaire, or both techniques, should she select the participants at random, include an equal number of people from each shift, or use some other approach? As Ann's supervisor, what would you suggest, and why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A questionnaire would not be the most effective approach since it would not let her ask dynamic questions and in turn can't provide emerging answers. Ann Ellis should utilize a mix method approach which means that some responses should be collected a semi-structured questionnaire and also conduct interviews with some employees. Instead of using simple random sampling, a shift-wise strategy would seem appropriate and stratified sampling must be utilized to draw samples. A stratified sampling can provide greater precision than a simple random sample in the same size. In conducting the interview, I would suggest that she should be honest and keep herself from any biases. In addition, it could be done through exploration as well as testing the happenings at the workplace.<strong>
