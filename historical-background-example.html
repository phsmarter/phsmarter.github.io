Try to DEDUCE andformulate its Research topic.Massachusetts provides good opportunities for historic population research, sinceregistration of births, deaths, and marriages was made compulsory in 1639 (Spiegelman,1968:3). Deerfield was selected as the community for study after a number of small towns inNorthwestern Massachusetts were considered. The reason Deerfield was chosen is becauseavailable records appeared to be very complete. The community of Deerfield's ownemphasis on its long history, and efforts by such specific groups as the Pocumtuck ValleyMemorial Asaociation, (founded in 1870), and the Heritage Foundation, provide for a goodlibrary with many well preserved records. Although several references concerning Deerfieldand Massachusetts are consulted, the major sources for the information presented beloware Baldwin's Vital Records of Deerfield, Massachusetts to the Year 1850 (1920); andGeorge Sheldon's History of Deerfield (1896). The major emphasis on the complete recordsgiven in Baldwin 2 (1920) with supplementary information being added from Sheldon'spublished genealogies (pp. 4-407, Vol. II). Sheldon's work is considered by many colonialhistorians to be a very well written and thorough local history. The vital statistics compiled byBaldwin appear to be very complete considering the time period covered and are based ongrave inscriptions as well as town and parish records. These statistics include 4943 births,1485 marriages, and 2204 deaths. In an effort to test the accuracy of the records, the localcemeteries around Deerfield were sample surveyed, and virtually 100 percent of thecemetery markers checked are found in Baldwin.Independent Assessment 1 /Direction: Identify the DATA used in the previous paragraph that was used to describe thebackground of the research.

Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – Outstanding Universal Value
The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far as two millennia ago in the pre-colonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippines Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, the Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all products of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years.
The five clusters are: (1) the Nagacadan terrace clusters in the municipality of Kiangan, in two distinctive rows of terraces divided by a river; (2) the Hungduan terrace cluster shaped like a spider web; (3) the central Mayoyao terrace cluster characterized by terraces in intervals with the traditional bale (houses) and alang (granaries); (4) the Bangaan terrace cluster in Banaue, the background of a typical Ifugao village; and (5) the Batad terrace cluster of Banaue that lies in semicircular terraces with a village at its base.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2, 000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization.
Built on steeper slopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terraces have complex irrigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops.
The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of biological resources which exist in the Ifugao agri-ecosystem.

Based on the information that you have learned from the selection, identify the paragraph that provides evidence as to why the Rice Terraces was proclaimed by UNESCO as a world heritage site, making it a world-renowned tourist destination.
Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – Outstanding Universal Value
The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far as two millennia ago in the pre-colonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippines Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, the Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all products of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years.
The five clusters are: (1) the Nagacadan terrace clusters in the municipality of Kiangan, in two distinctive rows of terraces divided by a river; (2) the Hungduan terrace cluster shaped like a spider web; (3) the central Mayoyao terrace cluster characterized by terraces in intervals with the traditional bale (houses) and alang (granaries); (4) the Bangaan terrace cluster in Banaue, the background of a typical Ifugao village; and (5) the Batad terrace cluster of Banaue that lies in semicircular terraces with a village at its base.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2, 000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization.
Built on steeper slopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terraces have complex irrigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops.
The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of biological resources which exist in the Ifugao agri-ecosystem.

                            22. Determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a particular atom. Objectives:1.Differentiate atoms from molecules. 2. Discuss the historical background of the atom and its sub-atomic particles and explain its relevance in the development of the atomic model. 3. Describe the atom and its sub-atomic particles. 4. Determine the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons in an atom. 5. Define isotopes and give examples and their uses. 6. Determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the different isotopes of an element.​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Atom refers to the smallest constituent unit of a chemical element. Molecules refer to a group of two or more atoms that are held together due to chemical bonds.</strong></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Matter is composed of indivisible building blocks. This idea was recorded as early as the fifth century BCE by Leucippus and Democritus. </strong></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>There are three subatomic particles: protons, neutrons and electrons. Two of the subatomic particles have electrical charges: protons have a positive charge while electrons have a negative charge. Neutrons, on the other hand, don't have a charge.</strong></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>To calculate the numbers of subatomic particles in an atom, use its atomic number and mass number: number of protons = atomic number. number of electrons = atomic number.</strong></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Isotope → Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons, but differ in numbers of neutrons. Isotopes are different forms of a single element. Example - Carbon 12 and Carbon 14 are both isotopes of carbon, one with 6 neutrons and one with 8 neutrons.</strong></p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>To find the number of neutrons in an isotope, subtract the number of protons from the atomic mass of the isotope. The atomic number of the element equals the number of protons.</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />
