Kishimoto said that there is a important person in Sarada's life will die to awake her MC something like that, I'm afraid that it would be Sakura because she grow up with her and Sakura gave a lot's of love to Sarada because we all know that she grow up without a father beside on her so she is really close to her mother. I'm just informing you this because that is really testimony of Kishimoto</a>

Beautiful Stories From Shakespeare: Hamlet
Edith Nesbit
Read the following excerpt:
Ophelia's brother, Laertes, had also just come to Court to ask justice for the death of his father, old Polonius; and now, wild with grief, he leaped into his sister's grave, to clasp her in his arms once more.
"I loved her more than forty thousand brothers," cried Hamlet, and leapt into the grave after him, and they fought till they were parted.
Afterwards Hamlet begged Laertes to forgive him.
"I could not bear," he said, "that any, even a brother, should seem to love her more than I."
But the wicked Claudius would not let them be friends. He told Laertes how Hamlet had killed old Polonius, and between them they made a plot to slay Hamlet by treachery.
Laertes challenged him to a fencing match, and all the Court were present. Hamlet had the blunt foil always used in fencing, but Laertes had prepared for himself a sword, sharp, and tipped with poison. And the wicked King had made ready a bowl of poisoned wine, which he meant to give poor Hamlet when he should grow warm with the sword play, and should call for drink.
So Laertes and Hamlet fought, and Laertes, after some fencing, gave Hamlet a sharp sword thrust. Hamlet, angry at this treachery—for they had been fencing, not as men fight, but as they play—closed with Laertes in a struggle; both dropped their swords, and when they picked them up again, Hamlet, without noticing it, had exchanged his own blunt sword for Laertes' sharp and poisoned one. And with one thrust of it he pierced Laertes, who fell dead by his own treachery.
Read this line again: He told Laertes how Hamlet had killed old Polonius, and between them they made a plot to slay Hamlet by treachery.

                                            MY FATHER GOES TO COURTBy Carlos BulosanThere was a family that lived in a small town on the Island of Luzon. Their father’s farm had been destroyed in 1898 by one of the Philippine flood. They had a very rich neighbour with two children that sudden came out of the house. Their rich neighbour also had a tall house that his children could look in the window of their house and watched them played, slept or eat, when they have food to eat.The rich man’s servant usually cooked special foods and the children smell the yummy aroma of the food. They always stay in the window to smell the spirit of the food. Then days passed, and the rich man’s children got thin and anaemic while the happy children, got robust and full of life.One day, the rich neighbour look at them one by one. My sisters, my brothers and then he banged down the window and immediately shut all the windows. From that day they never see the children once again. The window of the neighbour’s house were always closed. But still, they can smell the aroma of the food the servants were cooking.One morning a policeman from the presidencia came to their house with a sealed paper. The rich man had filled a complaint against them. His father took him to th town clerk and asked what is the complaint all about. Then the man claimed that we are been stealing the spirit of the rich man’s wealth and food.The day comes that they need to appear in court. They are the first to arrive and then his father sat on a chair in the centre of the courtroom while his mother occupied the chair by the door. The children sat on a long bench by the wall. The rich man arrived. He had grown old and his face was scarred with deep lines. With him was his young lawyer. Spectators came in and almost filled the chairs. The judge entered the room and sat on a high chair. They stood up in a hurry and then sat down again.The judge asked if the father has a lawyer with him and the father replied that he do not need one. The lawyer of the rich man start it with a question. The father agree that they inhaled the spirit of the food. He also agree that he’s children grow strong and limb while the rich man’s children grow thin and pale. He ask if he could see the complainant’s children. Then, the children arried shyly in the courtroom looking thin and pale. The father asked the judge if he could do examine the complaint, then the judge let him. He asked questions to the complaint that agree on all if it. The father walked across the room of the hall with the judge permission. In his hand is a hat full of coins. The sweet tinkle of the coins carried beautifully in the courtroom. The spectators looked at it with wonder.

"But you're six years too late!"Indeed, the best time to start training children is when they are still infants. Infants who knowthey will be danced to sleep by their adoring parent will demand the ritual every bedtime. But forthose who are used to just staying in the crib will go to sleep on their own without much fanfare.Children who are trained in the good habits of honesty, truthfulness, love, gentleness,obedience, reverence, and self-control develop good character. Responsible children grow up to beresponsible adults.It has often been said that education begins in the home. Truly, parents can give a tremendouschange in the education of their children.

HenryPlot SummaryDella Dillingham Young has one dollar and eighty-seven cents with which to buy her beloved husband, Jim, a Christmas gift. She is dismayed at how meager the amount is, as she has spent months saving. The Dillingham Youngs are very poor, with Jim’s earnings having been reduced from thirty dollars a week to only twenty dollars. Della’s dismay leads her to throw herself upon her “shabby” couch in her cheap and worn-down apartment. She reflects that she has spent many hours fantasizing about buying Jim a nice gift, one that would show him how pleased she is to be his wife. However, with only one dollar and eighty-seven cents, she knows she will be unable to acquire a suitable present.Inspiration strikes when Della catches sight of herself in the mirror. She pulls her hair down and lets the long tresses settle around her. The Dillingham Youngs have two prized possessions: Della’s beautiful hair and Jim’s gold watch, which he received from his father. Della quickly ties her hair up again and, after shedding a few tears, leaves the apartment.Della walks to Mme. Sofronie’s Hair Goods store with a “brilliant sparkle” in her eyes. She asks if Madame Sofronie will buy her hair, to which the Madame replies that she will need to see it first. Della lets down her hair, and Madame Sofronie offers her twenty dollars for it. Requesting only that the Madame make the process “quick,” Della agrees to sell her hair. She spends the next two hours searching for the perfect gift for Jim and finally decides upon a simple but tasteful platinum watch chain. She remarks that the watch chain suits Jim perfectly, as it is understated but undeniably valuable. Once the chain is attached to Jim’s watch, he will be able to proudly show off his prized possession without being ashamed of the battered leather strap he currently uses in place of a chain. Della rushes home, elated with her purchase. She carefully curls and styles her shorn hair but is disappointed with the results, remarking that she looks like a “Coney Island chorus girl.” She begins to worry that Jim will be upset that her hair is gone. When she hears Jim approaching the apartment, she stands beside the door and prays that he will still find her attractive. Jim enters the apartment and immediately stares at Della with an inscrutable expression on his face. Della throws herself into his arms and exclaims that she has sold her hair because she “couldn’t have lived through Christmas” without buying him a worthy present. She reassures Jim that her hair grows “awfully fast” and pleads with him to “be happy.” Jim, seemingly in a daze, asks Della if she has truly cut off her hair and looks around the room almost as if in search of the lost tresses. Della nervously confirms that she has indeed sold her hair, but she reassures Jim that she is still the same person even though her hair is gone. After all, she sold her hair so that she could give Jim a nice gift.Jim, coming out of his trance, pulls Della into an embrace and reassures her that he loves her no matter what. He then pulls a package out of his coat and tells Della that she will understand his reaction when she opens it. Della eagerly opens the package and is elated to discover that it contains a pair of beautiful tortoise shell combs that she had long admired in a shop window. Her elation turns to hysteria as she realizes that her hair is gone, but she tearfully tells Jim that her hair will grow back quickly. Eager to give Jim his gift, Della rises from her seat and presents the watch chain to Jim. However, rather than taking out his watch as Della requests, Jim instead sits down on the couch and tells Della that they should put away their presents, since they are “too nice to use,” given the couple’s current circumstances. He then explains that he sold his watch in order to afford Della’s combs. The story ends with the narrator commenting on the nature of gift-giving and generosity. Though the narrator describes Della and Jim as “foolish,” he also proclaims that among those who give and receive gifts, they are the wisest.The story of the necklace and The gift of the Magi. 1.

While cooking, they had a conversation about Liza, attending the funeral of her half-brother, Lem. Lem died of cancer, but it was evident that he was her father's son. Lem was not always the kindest to Liza when he was still alive. Though he was an acolyte for the church, he would always call Liza "sinverguenza", the shameless daughter. During the funeral, Liza recalled that she was greeted by Lem's mother. She described that she was not as pretty as her mom. Lem's mother asked for forgiveness, to whom Liza just nodded without any emotions. Lem's mother took this as a yes and hugged Liza. She recalled that she smelled like perfume and sweat, but didn't move so as not to be rude.Growing up, Liza always wondered who the boy who kept calling his father on the phone every day. And now that she had the answer, it broke her heart. She was always Daddy's girl. When it was time for Lem's burial, as they watch his coffin being lowered, Liza's father looked at her, and said sorry. The sinigang she and her Tita Loleng cooked will be served for dinner. Everything will be just the same, but different. Her dad will tell her mom about his day, and then ask each of them about theirs, her father will compliment her about the Sinigang they cooked and she would smile at her father like she always did.

"I loved her more than forty thousand brothers," cried Hamlet, and leapt into the grave after him, and they fought till they were parted.
Afterwards Hamlet begged Laertes to forgive him.
"I could not bear," he said, "that any, even a brother, should seem to love her more than I."
But the wicked Claudius would not let them be friends. He told Laertes how Hamlet had killed old Polonius, and between them they made a plot to slay Hamlet by treachery.
Laertes challenged him to a fencing match, and all the Court were present. Hamlet had the blunt foil always used in fencing, but Laertes had prepared for himself a sword, sharp, and tipped with poison. And the wicked King had made ready a bowl of poisoned wine, which he meant to give poor Hamlet when he should grow warm with the sword play, and should call for drink.
So Laertes and Hamlet fought, and Laertes, after some fencing, gave Hamlet a sharp sword thrust. Hamlet, angry at this treachery—for they had been fencing, not as men fight, but as they play—closed with Laertes in a struggle; both dropped their swords, and when they picked them up again, Hamlet, without noticing it, had exchanged his own blunt sword for Laertes' sharp and poisoned one. And with one thrust of it he pierced Laertes, who fell dead by his own treachery.
Read this line again: He told Laertes how Hamlet had killed old Polonius, and between them they made a plot to slay Hamlet by treachery.

Their father’s farm had been destroyed in 1898 by one of the Philippine flood. They had a very rich neighbour with two children that sudden came out of the house. Their rich neighbour also had a tall house that his children could look in the window of their house and watched them played, slept or eat, when they have food to eat.The rich man’s servant usually cooked special foods and the children smell the yummy aroma of the food. They always stay in the window to smell the spirit of the food. Then days passed, and the rich man’s children got thin and anaemic while the happy children, got robust and full of life.One day, the rich neighbour look at them one by one. My sisters, my brothers and then he banged down the window and immediately shut all the windows. From that day they never see the children once again. The window of the neighbour’s house were always closed. But still, they can smell the aroma of the food the servants were cooking.One morning a policeman from the presidencia came to their house with a sealed paper.

He asked questions to the complaint that agree on all if it. The father walked across the room of the hall with the judge permission. In his hand is a hat full of coins. The sweet tinkle of the coins carried beautifully in the courtroom. The spectators looked at it with wonder. The father asked the complainant if he heard the spirit of the money, the complainant answered yes. The father then said that they are paid.The rich man tried to talk but then he fell on the floor without a sound and his lawyer rushed to his aid.

"But you're six years too late!"Indeed, the best time to start training children is when they are still infants. Infants who knowthey will be danced to sleep by their adoring parent will demand the ritual every bedtime. But forthose who are used to just staying in the crib will go to sleep on their own without much fanfare.Children who are trained in the good habits of honesty, truthfulness, love, gentleness,obedience, reverence, and self-control develop good character. Responsible children grow up to beresponsible adults.It has often been said that education begins in the home. Truly, parents can give a tremendouschange in the education of their children. This responsibility can be fulfilled completely only byseeking God and asking Him for wisdom and guidance.Arrogante, et al, Question to be answered in plseparate sheet of paper1.

HenryPlot SummaryDella Dillingham Young has one dollar and eighty-seven cents with which to buy her beloved husband, Jim, a Christmas gift. She is dismayed at how meager the amount is, as she has spent months saving. The Dillingham Youngs are very poor, with Jim’s earnings having been reduced from thirty dollars a week to only twenty dollars. Della’s dismay leads her to throw herself upon her “shabby” couch in her cheap and worn-down apartment. She reflects that she has spent many hours fantasizing about buying Jim a nice gift, one that would show him how pleased she is to be his wife. However, with only one dollar and eighty-seven cents, she knows she will be unable to acquire a suitable present.Inspiration strikes when Della catches sight of herself in the mirror. She pulls her hair down and lets the long tresses settle around her. The Dillingham Youngs have two prized possessions: Della’s beautiful hair and Jim’s gold watch, which he received from his father. Della quickly ties her hair up again and, after shedding a few tears, leaves the apartment.Della walks to Mme. Sofronie’s Hair Goods store with a “brilliant sparkle” in her eyes. She asks if Madame Sofronie will buy her hair, to which the Madame replies that she will need to see it first. Della lets down her hair, and Madame Sofronie offers her twenty dollars for it. Requesting only that the Madame make the process “quick,” Della agrees to sell her hair. She spends the next two hours searching for the perfect gift for Jim and finally decides upon a simple but tasteful platinum watch chain. She remarks that the watch chain suits Jim perfectly, as it is understated but undeniably valuable. Once the chain is attached to Jim’s watch, he will be able to proudly show off his prized possession without being ashamed of the battered leather strap he currently uses in place of a chain. Della rushes home, elated with her purchase. She carefully curls and styles her shorn hair but is disappointed with the results, remarking that she looks like a “Coney Island chorus girl.” She begins to worry that Jim will be upset that her hair is gone. When she hears Jim approaching the apartment, she stands beside the door and prays that he will still find her attractive. Jim enters the apartment and immediately stares at Della with an inscrutable expression on his face. Della throws herself into his arms and exclaims that she has sold her hair because she “couldn’t have lived through Christmas” without buying him a worthy present. She reassures Jim that her hair grows “awfully fast” and pleads with him to “be happy.” Jim, seemingly in a daze, asks Della if she has truly cut off her hair and looks around the room almost as if in search of the lost tresses. Della nervously confirms that she has indeed sold her hair, but she reassures Jim that she is still the same person even though her hair is gone. After all, she sold her hair so that she could give Jim a nice gift.Jim, coming out of his trance, pulls Della into an embrace and reassures her that he loves her no matter what. He then pulls a package out of his coat and tells Della that she will understand his reaction when she opens it. Della eagerly opens the package and is elated to discover that it contains a pair of beautiful tortoise shell combs that she had long admired in a shop window. Her elation turns to hysteria as she realizes that her hair is gone, but she tearfully tells Jim that her hair will grow back quickly. Eager to give Jim his gift, Della rises from her seat and presents the watch chain to Jim. However, rather than taking out his watch as Della requests, Jim instead sits down on the couch and tells Della that they should put away their presents, since they are “too nice to use,” given the couple’s current circumstances. He then explains that he sold his watch in order to afford Della’s combs. The story ends with the narrator commenting on the nature of gift-giving and generosity. Though the narrator describes Della and Jim as “foolish,” he also proclaims that among those who give and receive gifts, they are the wisest.The story of the necklace and The gift of the Magi. 1.

                            14. The story starts with a girl named Liza, and her Tita Loleng, preparing Liza's favorite dish, Sinigang. Usually, it was never Liza's turn to help her Tita Loleng in cooking sinigang. But not today.Liza was the one tasked by her Tita Loleng to pick out the vegetables to use in the Sinigang. While cooking, they had a conversation about Liza, attending the funeral of her half-brother, Lem. Lem died of cancer, but it was evident that he was her father's son. Lem was not always the kindest to Liza when he was still alive. Though he was an acolyte for the church, he would always call Liza "sinverguenza", the shameless daughter. During the funeral, Liza recalled that she was greeted by Lem's mother. She described that she was not as pretty as her mom. Lem's mother asked for forgiveness, to whom Liza just nodded without any emotions. Lem's mother took this as a yes and hugged Liza. She recalled that she smelled like perfume and sweat, but didn't move so as not to be rude.Growing up, Liza always wondered who the boy who kept calling his father on the phone every day. And now that she had the answer, it broke her heart. She was always Daddy's girl. When it was time for Lem's burial, as they watch his coffin being lowered, Liza's father looked at her, and said sorry. The sinigang she and her Tita Loleng cooked will be served for dinner. Everything will be just the same, but different. Her dad will tell her mom about his day, and then ask each of them about theirs, her father will compliment her about the Sinigang they cooked and she would smile at her father like she always did. But this time, her smile won't even reach her eyes.Activity. Directions: Study the following questions carefully and write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.1.
