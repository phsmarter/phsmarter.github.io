Even if my school is a bit far, I just think of it as a good exercise. Another way is I brought my own food to school. I packed the food we have at home and eat it in school so that I do not need money to buy anything. And last, I worked in my aunt's store after class. She would give me Php 50.00 a day after I helped her clean her store. RUBRIC​</a>

Example: There was a time when I was in Grade 5 that my parents cannot give me an allowance going to school. We do not have much money then. It was a big problem for me because I really want to go to school. To help me overcome this problem, I decided to just walk to and from school. Even if my school is a bit far, I just think of it as a good exercise. Another way is I brought my own food to school. I packed the food we have at home and eat it in school so that I do not need money to buy anything. And last, I worked in my aunt’s store after class. She would give me Php 50.00 a day after I helped her clean her store. ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________</a>

You only need to choose one between the two topics you listed. Add relevant details to support your ideas. Use signal words when possible. Example: There was a time when I was in Grade 5 that my parents cannot give me an allowance going to school. We do not have much money then. It was a big problem for me because I really want to go to school. To help me overcome this problem, I decided to just walk to and from school. Even if my school is a bit far, I just think of it as a good exercise. Another way is I brought my own food to school. I packed the food we have at home and eat it in school so that I do not need money to buy anything. And last, I worked in my aunt’s store after class. She would give me Php 50.00 a day after I helped her clean her store. ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________</h2><br />
