This trend is on the rise and is increasingly becoming a problem because it hinders the objective of keeping the environment clean and can have serious impacts on wildlife and habitat.</p><p></p><p>According to environmental protection agencies and departments, this malpractice is termed as illegal dumping. It is considered unlawful on account of the harm it causes to the environment. What’s more, there are officially designated areas with properly integrated waste management systems, which should be used for dumping. Therefore, in defying the clearly outlined laws for appropriate dumping by throwing trash just anywhere, such as by the roadside or in the forest, it becomes unlawful</p><br />

But although they do have their benefits, they don 't always outweigh the consequences.  </p><p>It is how the speeches are laid out causes most of the problems.
