                                            Directions: Read and reflect on the short essay then answer the guide questions on a separate sheet of paper.          Man as a Social Animal        By Ma. Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Yes, I believe that man is a social animal because humans have a natural instinct to live in society with other human beings.</p><p></p><p>2. Man becomes a social animal by forming social groups with common interests and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background, and other personal qualities.</p><p></p><p>3. Human interaction is very important in building a nation because it helps people form social groups that can work together towards common goals.</p><p></p><br />

I strongly believe that <strong>respect should be given to everyone</strong> regardless of age. It is also a part of inclusivity which is an emerging issue in today's society after studies show that an inclusive community means there are <strong>fewer inequalities</strong> which translates to a <strong>progressive nation. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Learn more about The Filipino Way here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2590627</p><p>#SPJ1</p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                            13. ESSAY: how these non-state institutions contribute to nation building?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Providing vital public services is typically seen as the responsibility of the state. However, in practice a number of formal and informal providers are likely to be delivering water, sanitation, education and health in most developing country settings.  Non-state providers (NSP) take many forms, ranging from large-scale for-profit firms, to individual entrepreneurs, to non-profit community groups. In conflict-affected contexts, some basic services may also be delivered by non-state armed groups with territorial control over a particular area. In other contexts, NGOs or faith based organisations may be the provider of choice for some or all parts of the population. Research shows that poor people use private providers to a surprising extent, given the associated costs, and sometimes choose them over free public services.</p><p></p><p>There is considerable debate about the role and impact of private and non-state health and education providers in developing countries. Some experts argue NSPs are pro-poor where they provide access to services in areas not reached by state provision. Others are concerned with the equity, quality, affordability and sustainability implications of non-state provision. Promoting better state engagement with non-state providers is often proposed as a route towards reducing any such negative impacts, but in practice state-NSP relationships are often characterised by mistrust.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p>:)</p><br />

My answer has always been this is the Independence which I yearned for in terms of ideals as well as vision.</p><p></p><p>Only that the reality of being an independent country, in our case, carries difficulties and enormous challenges not only for those who govern but also for the whole population.</p><p></p><p>The building of a nation is a process and the process itself will, of course, take time. Whether short or long term it depends on the policies and programs of those who are tasked with the responsibility to produce.</p><p></p><p>Timor-Leste is in this situation. The post-conflict situation nourishes the psychological basis of the feelings and experiences of the people, because violence and destruction left imprints on the body and soul of our people.</p><p></p><p>It is normal that, in post-conflict situations, trauma (supposedly collective, as in the whole society) is emphasised as the worst thing to be confronted, as though it is a ‘sine qua non’ condition for the resurrection of the people for the new process.</p><p></p><p>And when we speak about reconciliation it is almost a crime not to speak of justice and many argue that it clashes with ethics and morals (in relation to justice for the sake of justice), which the activists – that once we were a part of – today uphold as the sword of human rights.</p><p></p><p>Reconciliation is an important factor, be it at a national level or, above all, at the community level.

                        <p><strong>Yes, I am in favor of including history in the curriculum with its views on nation-building and social awareness.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>     The purpose of studying history</strong> is basically to know important events from the past and the changes or evolution of an object or event. By studying history, students' insight and understanding of world civilization will be wider. </p><p>     As the saying goes, "The best teacher is an experience". Even though the students don't directly experience what happened in the past, through <strong>history</strong> lessons, students can learn and appreciate the important things that happened in every historical event, from positive things, mistakes that happened, to learning positive characters from every historical figure, especially national history. Therefore this lesson is very important to be included in the <strong>curriculum</strong> because it will indirectly increase students' social awareness and help build student character.</p><p>     But for some students,<strong> history</strong> is a boring subject and not many of them really remember the history they have learned and apply it in real life. So, to be able to maximize the benefits of history lessons in the <strong>curriculum</strong> there must be innovation in teaching the material so that students become more interested.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about why history is important</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10496016</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                            24. What does respect have to do with you and with others?Find out more by reading the two excerpts. Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

Remind yourself and others just WHY various media (including friends and relatives) say what they do, hold the views they cling to. In many cases it will be avarice - looking for gain; in others, fear of loss. 2. Turn the conversation to justification, evidence and logic. Unfortunately, so many ‘facts’ are put forth nowadays, from unknown or dubious sources, that this can become a flurry of anecdotes, many of them fantasy. Conspiracy theorists, for example, collect snowstorms of fantasy ‘facts’ that they fling in the faces of reasonable people. So suspect the unlikely.</p><br />
