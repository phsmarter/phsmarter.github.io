The country's unique blend of ancient tradition and modern innovation had always fascinated me, and I knew that a trip there would be an unforgettable experience.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the opportunity to visit Japan presented itself. I eagerly packed my bags and set off on my journey.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in Japan, I was immediately struck by the country's beauty. The streets of Tokyo were a blend of towering skyscrapers and quaint shrines, while the natural landscape of Kyoto was dotted with stunning temples and gardens.</p><p></p><p>I spent my days exploring the bustling streets of Tokyo, trying out new and delicious foods at local markets, and marveling at the city's futuristic technology. I visited the iconic Senso-ji Temple and took a stroll through the peaceful Meiji Jingu Shrine. I even had the chance to witness a traditional tea ceremony, which was a truly special experience.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't just the big cities that left an impression on me. I also had the opportunity to visit the small town of Takayama, where I was able to see firsthand the traditional way of life that still persists in rural Japan. I spent a day exploring the charming streets of the town and even visited a sake brewery to learn about the local specialty.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my trip to Japan was an incredible experience that I will never forget. From the bustling streets of Tokyo to the peaceful small towns, the country had something to offer at every turn. I left Japan with a newfound appreciation for the country's rich culture and a desire to return someday and continue exploring all that it has to offer.</p><p>Japan was a country I'd always yearned to see. I had long been attracted by the nation's distinctive fusion of age-old customs and contemporary innovation, and I was confident that a visit would be a once-in-a-lifetime event.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the chance to travel to Japan arrived. I eagerly prepared my belongings for my trip and left.</p><p></p><p>When I first arrived in Japan, I was astounded by how stunning the nation was. Tokyo's streets were a mix of tall skyscrapers and small shrines, while Kyoto's countryside was filled with beautiful temples and gardens.</p><p></p><br />

That means the break already started very good.</p><p>I had a very good first American Christmas experience.</p><p></p><p>My host-moms family is very big, so one day before Christmas we had a little Christmas party with this side of the family.

It was different to see how the American church works, but interesting. After church we went home and had dinner. It was very delicious.</p><p></p><p>Then it was finally Christmas morning. Santa brought me some very nice presents. One of my favorite presents is the Tommy Hilfiger I got.</p><p></p><p>On new years eve, I was at my friend’s house with a few other friends. We watched movies and talked the whole time. My friend Mercedes was there too and she is a foreign exchange student from Spain. In Spain, they have this tradition. You eat twelve grapes in the last twelve seconds of the year. We all tried it, but I think Mercedes and I were the only ones who ate all the twelve grapes. That was fun, I think I want to do it every year now.</p><p></p><p>I didn’t do anything special after New Years Eve.

                            24. narrative essay about communication issues​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>narrative essay</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Communication is a vital process in organizations and companies in today’s world. It has been defined as an activity that entails transmitting information through interexchange of views or messages by behavior, signals, writing, visuals, and speech. The process of communication requires a sender, the message to be sent, and a receiver. However, it is mandatory for the receiver to be aware of the sender’s intention to communicate. This means that a sender can be able to communicate with a receiver across vast distances (Wilson 2010).
</p><p>
</p><p>Normally, the communication the process is complete after it is clear that the receiver understood the message as intended by the sender. Communicative commonality is integral to effective communication between communicating parties. Effective communication is not only needed inside an organization but also when dealing with external stakeholders. It enables organization to achieve competitive edge considering the fact that it through it that an organization remains responsive to consumer needs (Jones &amp; George 2007). On the contrary, poor communication disrupts almost everything in an organization.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a number of barriers to effective communication (Huczynski &amp; Buchanan 2010). This paper intends to highlight the barriers and how three organizations (Professional Sports, Bernard Mathews, and NHS trust Hospital) have been able to handle the barriers to ensure effective communication. Barriers to Effective Communication Barriers to communication are factors that might hinder effective communication between parties in the workplace. According to Antony and MacVicar (2011), this includes language barriers, cultural barriers, organizational barriers, personal barriers, and interpersonal barriers.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Communication Issues
</p><p>Each of us communicate on a daily basis, but oftentimes we miscommunicate and do not get our intended point across. There are a lot of guidelines that help to make for more effective communications, one being is to have eye contact with the person you are communicating with. By looking at the person it shows that a you are interested in what the person is saying and are paying attention and is engaged with the conversation. By a lack of eye contact with another other person, it shows that you are disinterested in the conversation. By practicing direct eye contact with the person you are speaking to, will assist in maintaining good lines of communication. Besides, eye contact, it is important to be a good listener. By asking “What” and “Why” questions it will ensure that you are attentive to the what the person is saying. In effective communications between two people, it is important that each individual understand what message is being communicated. It also important to reflect upon what a person has said when there is a pause in the communication. This allows for each individual to think about the conversation and maintain a continuous flow of the conversation. It should be noted that good communications between individuals is a two-way street.
</p><p>As for me personally, there are a lot of situations that has made me a good listener. Oftentimes, I was interrupting the people who were speaking and not listening to what they were talking about. There was a problem for me to be attentive to the details of conversation and I had not listened to them during the conversation and forgetting most everything that was said. One day during a conversation, a friend told me that my problem was that I was not a good listener. They went on to say that I needed to develop more effective listening skills. They suggested that during a conversation, I should focus on a what is being said, remain silent until the speaker has completed what they were saying. In turn, it would show to the speaker that I was interested in what they were saying. It should also be noted that during a conversation, the subject should not be changed as it will disrupt the communication process. When engaged in conversation, I should put aside my own thoughts and intently listen to what the person is saying. I should place all of my attention to the speaker and not hurry the speaker before they have completed what they are saying.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps...</p><br />

                        <p>                                    <strong>BEST FRIENDS FOR LIFE
</strong></p><p>“It was the 4th of July, and the summer heat was as blistering as ever in New Mexico. Lilly-Ann, Daniela, and I – the three best friends – set out to go on a girly picnic as we would every year since we were nine years old. I had done all my chores and packed the picnic basket the night before, so as soon as I brushed my teeth and had a coffee, I was ready to dress up and go have a good time with my besties. I took my beat-up Cherokee and sped down the street to meet up with Daniela; we would pick Lilly-Ann later.
</p><p>
</p><p>Daniela and I shared the same birthday – February 27th, 1986. Our moms were also best friends from high school. They went to the same college and got married the same year. Everyone always laughed at how it all resembled a generic best-friends-for-life movie or novel. It seemed like Daniela and I were destined to be best friends. Neither of us had siblings, so we became much like sisters to each other. We shared all interests and hobbies without exception. We both joined the school’s female soccer team, and both played in the defense. But, most important of all, we were always there for each other in the toughest of situations, regardless of how preoccupied either of us might have been.
</p><p>
</p><p>Our traditional spot for Independence Day picnic was on the bank of the Beaver River. Here, half a mile west from the town, it is always as cool as it gets in July in New Mexico. As we were riding the rocky backroad, my bike was screaking in unison with the fireworks that exploded in the clear sky from the early morning.
</p><p>
</p><p>The meadow on our spot always inspired us to go play a little soccer, as we did this time as well. Then, we felt like we need to fresh up a little, so we went into the river. We even managed to catch a small catfish, but we let it go. The ride, the soccer, and the swim made us hungry, and we sat down to have some lunch. We all always pack a little more food than we need for a picnic, so we always have something of a menu to choose from. We all picked Lilly-Ann’s roasted chicken with pineapple and mashed potatoes. During and after the meal, we chattered and giggled non-stop as besties like us always would. Then suddenly, Daniela seized laughing and stared blankly into the water for a moment or two.
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Stunned, without the slightest idea of what was going on, all I could mumble was a faint “I promise.”
</p><p>
</p><p>By this time, it began to get dark, and my dad had already texted me asking about my whereabouts. So, we rushed home. Lilly-Ann’s place was the nearest to the river, then was Daniela’s, and mine wasthe farthest. As Daniela and I said goodbye and I sat on the bike to be on my way, she was still on the porch waving goodbye and shouted “Remember your promise,” reminding me of something I couldn’t wish to forget anyway.
</p><p>
</p><p>These words ring through my head to this day. A pitch black mustang rolled from around the corner and headed our way.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Dani…” I cried out as I leaped off the bike and to the side.
</p><p>
</p><p>Stunned by the loud skiddle of tires and screams, I passed out. After I came to my sense, the first thing I saw was Daniela’s limp body in her mother’s hands as I heard hysterical weeping. My head suddenly felt heavy, and my legs felt cotton-like. Dazed, I landed on my behind in slow motion. The air felt thick and heavy, and I fainted once more. The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed and seeing my mother sitting next to me, sobbing.
</p><p>
</p><p>I urged to tell her about my promise, but all I could utter was “Why her?” – and then I burst into tears myself.
</p><p>
</p><p>Nobody can take their best friend’s death well. I became antisocial. I barely left my room, and whenever someone tried to talk to me about anything, I responded with brief and bitter remarks. I wallowed in myself. Whirlwinds of thoughts circled in my head – Why Daniela? Of all people, why did she have to die? Couldn’t God pick someone more deserving of death? I could not imagine how I was supposed to live on without her. Nobody could replace her in my life, not even all the people in the world.
</p><p>
</p><p>After one month of grieving, I finally found the strength to talk to my mother. “Does God love us?” I asked, “Why does he hurt us?” “My girl,” she said, “He picks the best of us and takes them before the cruel world can deform them. He turns them into His angels, and Daniela must be your angel now.”
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>

                            26. write a narrative essay entitled "my most memorable trip"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It was the summer of my sophomore year in college, and I had been saving up for months to take a trip with my best friend, Sarah. We had decided to travel to Europe, a place we had both dreamed of visiting for years. Our itinerary was packed with sightseeing and adventure, but little did we know, one experience would stand out above all others.</p><p></p><p>Our journey began in London, where we spent three days exploring the city's iconic landmarks, such as the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace. We then took a train to Paris, where we strolled through the charming streets and indulged in the city's famous cuisine. From there, we ventured to Amsterdam, where we marveled at the city's stunning canals and visited the Anne Frank House.</p><p></p><p>But it was our next destination, Venice, that would be etched in our memories forever. As soon as we arrived, we were struck by the city's unique beauty, with its winding canals and stunning architecture. We decided to take a gondola ride through the city, and it turned out to be one of the most magical experiences of our lives.</p><p></p><p>As we drifted along the canals, we were surrounded by the sound of water lapping against the boat and the gentle murmur of Italian voices. Our gondolier, a friendly man with a thick accent, pointed out the city's landmarks and regaled us with stories of Venice's history. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the city, and the colors of the buildings seemed to dance in the light.</p><p></p><p>But then, something unexpected happened. As we approached a small bridge, our gondolier began to sing. His voice was rich and full, and the song was in Italian, a language we didn't understand, but the melody was beautiful. As he sang, the other gondoliers around us joined in, their voices harmonizing in perfect unison. It was as if the entire city had come alive with music.</p><p></p><p>Sarah and I looked at each other, tears in our eyes, and knew that this moment would stay with us forever. We were in awe of the beauty of the city and the warmth of its people. It was a feeling of pure joy and wonder that we will never forget.</p><p></p><p>After our gondola ride, we walked around the city, feeling like we were in a dream. We stopped at a small café and sipped espresso while we watched the sunset over the Grand Canal. We talked about our trip, our hopes and dreams, and the people we had met along the way.</p><p></p><p>As we left Venice the next day, we knew that we had experienced something truly special. Our trip had been full of incredible moments, but our gondola ride and the impromptu concert on the canal was a memory that would always stand out. It reminded us that travel is not just about seeing new places but also about connecting with people, experiencing new cultures, and being open to unexpected moments of beauty and joy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope it helps </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>            Hemophilia is a rare genetic bleeding disorder that causes the blood to clot abnormally. People born with hemophilia are lacking or have very clotting factor, which is the protein needed for blood to clot normally. The clotting factor works together with platelets to clot blood by helping the platelets to stick together and plug cuts on the vessel. This stops the bleeding. A person can have mild, moderate, or severe Hemophilia, depending on how much clotting factor they have. A person without Hemophilia has 100% of these clotting factors, while a person with severe Hemophilia has less than one percent. </p><p>            The disease is more common in men, affecting approximately one in 5,000 each year. this is because the Hemophilia gene is only located on the X chromosome. Men have one X and one Y chromosome, which means that if the X chromosome has the faulty gene, they will be born with Hemophilia. Women, however, have two X chromosomes. They will only be born with Hemophilia if both X chromosomes have the bad gene. If only one has it, the woman becomes a carrier of the disease. This means that she doesn’t have the disease, but she is able to pass it on to her children. A female can be born with Hemophilia if her dad has it and her mom is a carrier of it. Although Hemophilia is a genetic disease, some males are born with it even if neither of their parents have it. </p><p>               An individual with Hemophilia should know all of the signs and symptoms of the disease, as well as when it is necessary to go to the doctor or emergency room such as: very heavy continuous bleeding, limited motion, pain or swelling of the joints, or any signs of bleeding in the brain as these can be life threatening. When dealing with children who have hemophilia, it is best to inform them about the disease that they have, as well as put them in support groups. They should be protected with kneepads, elbow pads, and helmets when biking or doing similar activities. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Hemophilia is usually <strong>an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.</strong> This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery.<p>Hemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.
