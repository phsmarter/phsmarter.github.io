                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Puberty is the period during which boys or girls undergo the process of sexual maturation. Physical changes occur so that way a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilization. Precocious puberty on the other hand, is puberty that occurs significantly earlier than normal. It starts as early as 8 years old for girls and 9 years old for boys. There is said to be two different types of precocious puberty: central precocious puberty and peripheral precocious…</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong:)</p><p>Everybody goes through puberty. Puberty is a series of changes that transform a child into an adult who can bare children. The hypothalamus and the pituitary glands are two parts of the brain that begin to create more hormones, including the growth hormone, which act on the human body to allow these changes to happen. Both males and females have these hormones, but operate on different parts of the body. There is no set age for when puberty occurs; everybody develops at a different rate. Different kinds of changes occur during puberty. There are physical changes (external and internal) as well as emotional, that girls and boys experience during this time, the two are not very similar, but there are a few characteristics that both the male and female acquire. This paper will address the major changes that happen during this time of development.</p><p></p><p>Boys usually develop around ages 10-15. The first sign of the beginning of puberty is the enlargement of the testicles, and the lengthening of the penis. The skin of the scrotum (the external pouch that holds the testes) begins to redden and thin out, and pubic hair begins to sprout around this region. Hair also begins to grow on the face, legs, chest, and underarms. The growth of the body happens the fastest during puberty. Four or more inches added to the height may be obtained in one year. The general shape of the body changes, and muscles are developed, as well as strength. Another attribute that boys receive is a voice change. Before puberty, the voice is high and during this development, the voice may start to crack going from high to low due to the lengthening of the vocal cords and the increase of the larynx. It will eventually mature into a deep, manly voice. Boys usually begin to have spontaneous erections when puberty has begun. An erection is when the nervous system activates an increase in blood flow, and the penis is filled with blood. This causes the penis to become stiff and hard. This can happen when sexual thoughts or arousal is occurring, or sometimes without cause. When erections take place, it might 1. Go away by itself, or 2. ejaculate. Ejaculating is a process by which the sperm from the testicles is released out of the penis. A major process that occurs during puberty is that boys are able to produce sperm, which fertilize a womans egg to make a baby. Ejaculation needs to occur at one point, to release some of these fluids. This happens either after sexual stimulation, or during a natural process called nocturnal emissions or, “wet dreams.”</p><p></p><p>The hormones flowing through a boy’s body frequently leads to emotional ruling. Testosterone produces aggressive behavior, and sometimes they don’t even become aware of their actions. Frustration and anxiety is also another characteristic of the feelings boys are going through. Either they feel like they are not developing as fast as their peers around them, or that they are developing faster than them. Their appearance also may not be appealing or satisfying to them, so worry is often on their minds. Public erections happen every now and then, and it may be uncontrollable to the boy, which is why they become embarrassed if it happens, but once the boy becomes older, it is easier for them to control their erections. Independence also develops. Boys feel like they are able to make their own decisions, without having to rely on mom and dad. All of these emotions lead from a boy, to a man. In first Corinthians 13:11, it says “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.”</p><p></p><p>Puberty is the period during which boys or girls undergo the process of sexual maturation. Physical changes occur so that way a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilization. Precocious puberty on the other hand, is puberty that occurs significantly earlier than normal. It starts as early as 8 years old for girls and 9 years old for boys.

                        <p></p><p>Puberty is the changes physical change that is experienced physically in order to facilitate the dynamic transition of a child to an adult. The whole process is brought about by hormone alerted to gonads from the brain. Gonads release diverse hormones and growth is stimulated in such organs as blood, skin, breasts, bones, muscle, hair, and system of reproduction. Growth proceeds in the initial stages of puberty and ceases once puberty is completed. Transition in shape, size, and composition is experienced in structures of the body and the system as a whole. The outstanding difference between puberty in both girls and boys is the age, which it commences. Girls start getting mature four years after the initial transitions of puberty shows up. Boys move slowly but growth continues even after changes in puberty can still be seen. Testerone is the major hormone for men, which facilitate all changes in them. Boys are generally shorter than girls when they start experiencing puberty changes but this is different on adult men who are taller than their women counterpart. Estrogen is a hormone, which drives a woman puberty stage.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>gusto mo summary mo na lang nakita ko lang Naman sa google yan. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Lets get it shorter</p><p></p>Puberty is a period during which adolescents reach sexual maturity and become capable of reproduction. <br />

Share your experiences and what you have felt at that time.</strong><p>Puberty is a milestone that marks a great transition in our lives. The physical, emotional, and mental changes that occur during this time are often overwhelming but must be embraced to become the individuals we are meant to be. As I reflect on this part of my life, I can recall the distinct feelings I experienced during my own puberty stage and the changes I have seen in myself. </p><p></p><p>Physically, puberty began for me with a growth spurt accompanied by a few awkward moments. My bones and muscles grew quickly, making my body appear lanky and out of proportion. As I got older and my body continued to grow, I noticed subtle changes such as acne and an increase in body hair. My voice also deepened and my shoulders broadened as I transformed from a child into an adult. </p><p></p><p>Emotionally, I felt overwhelmed by the changes occurring in my body. I was often embarrassed about my appearance and how others perceived me. It was a difficult period of adjustment as I learned to accept and embrace my new self. Additionally, I experienced hormonal changes which left me feeling emotional and frustrated at times. </p><p></p><p>Mentally, I underwent tremendous growth and development.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Before puberty — around age 10 in girls and 12 in boys — teens have an increase in appetite.  This paves the way for early adolescence when the human body needs more calories than any other time in life. That hunger spurt usually — but not always — stops when a child stops growing.  During puberty, boys need about 2,800 calories a day. Girls need about 2,200 calories a day.  Typically, the ravenous hunger starts to wane once a child has stopped growing, though not always. Bigger, taller, or more active teens will still need more calories into late adolescence. Getting those calories from the right foods becomes critical for good health during puberty and beyond. Our Core Plan contains sufficient amounts of protein and other nutrients to help your teen thrive. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Changes for Boys and Girls</p><p>For boys, the hormones travel through the blood and tell the testes (say: TES-teez), the two egg-shaped glands in the scrotum (the sac that hangs under the penis), to begin making testosterone (say: tess-TAHS-tuh-rone) and sperm. Testosterone is the hormone that causes most of the changes in a boy's body during puberty, and men need sperm to be able to reproduce (be the father of a baby).</p><p></p><p>In girls, these hormones target the two ovaries (say: OH-vuh-reez), which contain eggs that have been in the girl's body since she was born. The hormones cause the ovaries to start making another hormone, called estrogen. Together, these hormones prepare a girl's body to start her periods and be able to become pregnant someday.</p><p>Boys and girls both begin to grow hair under their arms and their pubic areas (on and around the genitals). It starts out looking light and thin. Then, as kids go through puberty, it becomes longer, thicker, heavier, curlier, and darker. Eventually, boys also start to grow hair on their faces.</p><p></p><p>It's Just a Growth Spurt</p><p>A spurt is a short burst of activity or something that happens in a hurry. And a growth spurt is just that: Your body is growing and it's happening really fast!</p><p></p><p>When you go through puberty, it might seem like your sleeves are always getting shorter and your pants are creeping up your legs. That's because you're having a growth spurt that lasts for about 2 to 3 years. When that growth spurt is at its peak, some kids grow 4 or more inches (10 or more centimeters) in a year! At the end of your growth spurt, you'll have reached your adult height — or just about.</p><p>But your height isn't the only thing that changes during puberty.</p><p>With all this quick growth, it can seem like one part of your body — your feet, for instance — are growing faster than everything else. This can make you feel clumsy or awkward. This is normal, too! The rest of your body will eventually fill out and shape up, and you'll feel less klutzy.</p><p></p><p>Taking Shape</p><p>Your body also fills out and changes shape during puberty. A boy's shoulders will grow wider and his body will become more muscular. He may notice a bit of breast growth on his chest. Don't worry, this is normal — and it goes away for most boys by the end of puberty.</p><p></p><p>In addition, boys' voices crack and eventually become deeper, their penises grow longer and wider, and their testes get bigger. All of these changes mean that their bodies are developing as they should during puberty.</p><p></p><p>Girls' bodies usually become curvier. Their hips get wider and their breasts develop, starting with just a little swelling under the nipples. Sometimes one breast grows more quickly than the other, but most of the time they even out. Girls may start wearing bras around this time, especially if they are involved in sports or exercise classes.</p><p></p><p>Face Up to Changes</p><p>Another thing that may come with puberty is acne (say: AK-nee) — or pimples — caused by all those hormones at work in the body.</p><p></p><p>Skin gets oilier and pimples sometimes start showing up when puberty begins, and you may get them throughout the teenage years. You might see pimples on your face, your upper back, or your upper chest.</p><p></p><p>To help control pimples, wash your face twice a day with warm water and a mild soap or cleanser. Don't squeeze, pick, or pop your pimples. Your doctor can also offer suggestions for clearing up acne. The good news is that acne usually gets a lot better as you get older.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>: “When puberty begins, testicles, which is where most of the hormone testosterone is produced, start to produce sperm. ... For reproduction to happen, the sperm exit the testicles and travel up through the two small tubes called the vas deferens. After they pass through the vas deferens, the sperm cells mix with semen.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Puberty is when a child's body begins to develop and change as they become an adult. Girls develop breasts and start their periods. Boys develop a deeper voice and facial hair will start to appear. </p><p></p><p>Puberty is related to reproduction because when a child already goes to puberty it just means that she/he is already capable of bearing a child. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We have all felt it. The fear-inducing burden of stress that makes hearts race and palms sweat. The definition of stress is a specific response by the body to a stimulus, which disturbs the normal physiological equilibrium of an organism. That’s a mouthful. I think of stress as the weight that sits on my shoulders, the presence of an impending disaster or deadline that lurks just around the corner.  It’s the race to get everything done before life falls apart. I’m sure you all know that feeling, because stress is not biased in whom it chooses to victimize.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Changes During Puberty for Boys and Girls</p><p>What is puberty? Growing up. Everyone goes through the same process. Whether you start at age 9 or at age 15, it’s all “normal.’’ You are still you inside. Your body and feelings are changing at their own pace. Growing up can be a great experience: a time of changing and finding out who you are. Hormones are responsible for the changes you are beginning to notice. In boys, testosterone is the hormone. In girls, it's estrogen. Girls may start normal puberty as early as age 7 or not start at all until age 15. For boys it is usually anywhere between ages 9 and 15.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Changes for Boys and Girls</p><p>For boys, the hormones travel through the blood and tell the testes (say: TES-teez), the two egg-shaped glands in the scrotum (the sac that hangs under the penis), to begin making testosterone (say: tess-TAHS-tuh-rone) and sperm. Testosterone is the hormone that causes most of the changes in a boy's body during puberty, and men need sperm to be able to reproduce (be the father of a baby).</p><p></p><p>In girls, these hormones target the two ovaries (say: OH-vuh-reez), which contain eggs that have been in the girl's body since she was born. The hormones cause the ovaries to start making another hormone, called estrogen. Together, these hormones prepare a girl's body to start her periods and be able to become pregnant someday.</p><p>Boys and girls both begin to grow hair under their arms and their pubic areas (on and around the genitals). It starts out looking light and thin. Then, as kids go through puberty, it becomes longer, thicker, heavier, curlier, and darker. Eventually, boys also start to grow hair on their faces.</p><p></p><p>It's Just a Growth Spurt</p><p>A spurt is a short burst of activity or something that happens in a hurry. And a growth spurt is just that: Your body is growing and it's happening really fast!</p><p></p><p>Taking Shape</p><p>Your body also fills out and changes shape during puberty. A boy's shoulders will grow wider and his body will become more muscular. He may notice a bit of breast growth on his chest. Don't worry, this is normal — and it goes away for most boys by the end of puberty.</p><p></p><p>In addition, boys' voices crack and eventually become deeper, their penises grow longer and wider, and their testes get bigger. All of these changes mean that their bodies are developing as they should during puberty.</p><p></p><p>Girls' bodies usually become curvier. Their hips get wider and their breasts develop, starting with just a little swelling under the nipples. Sometimes one breast grows more quickly than the other, but most of the time they even out. Girls may start wearing bras around this time, especially if they are involved in sports or exercise classes.</p><p></p><p>With all this growing and developing going on, some girls may be uncomfortable with how their bodies are changing, but it's unhealthy for girls to diet to try to stop any normal weight gain. If you have any questions about puberty or are worried about your weight, talk to your parent or doctor.</p><p></p><p>Face Up to Changes</p><p>Skin gets oilier and pimples sometimes start showing up when puberty begins, and you may get them throughout the teenage years. You might see pimples on your face, your upper back, or your upper chest.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
