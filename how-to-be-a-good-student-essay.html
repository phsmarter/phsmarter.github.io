                            1. How to be a good student? Essay </h2><br />
                        What is the main characteristic of a good student? A good student must 
have a huge desire and passion to learn and explore something new. 
Everything would indeed seem very easy and enjoyable if we think of 
school as a place for discovering our self as person not as a 
frustrating place where we are always pressured by a tremendous amount 
of work. Furthermore, a good student must be punctual, organized, and 
know how to develop self-discipline. For instance, he or she must always
 come to class and the assignments and projects on time. Developing a 
good time-management and self-discipline is, in fact, a part of 
professional development for students and directly related to their 
success. In addition, a good student must be active and be polite. A 
good student would actively participate in the class discussions and 
would not hesitate to ask questions to his or her teachers. In addition,
 a good student would also always listen to the teachers and never 
interrupt when the teachers are talking or explaining something. Other 
aspects of a good student are honesty and consistency. A good student 
should be academically honest in all aspects of their schoolwork. For 
example, he or she would never cheat on tests or presents the work done 
by others as if it were his or her own (plagiarizes). Lastly, 
consistency is very critical in the process of learning since it helps 
students to achieve their academic goals.<br />             <br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>How to be a Good Student</p><p></p><p>As a student, it is important to develop good study habits and behaviors to achieve academic success. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, there are several strategies and techniques that can help you become a good student.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important things you can do to become a good student is to develop good time management skills. This means planning your time effectively and prioritizing your tasks to ensure that you are making the most of your available time. A good way to do this is to create a study schedule or timetable, setting aside dedicated time for studying, attending classes, completing assignments, and engaging in extracurricular activities. By doing so, you can ensure that you are devoting enough time to each task, while also avoiding procrastination and last-minute cramming.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of being a good student is developing good study habits. This includes taking good notes during lectures and reading assignments, actively participating in class discussions, and reviewing your notes and assignments regularly. Additionally, it is important to ask questions when you don't understand something, seek out extra help from teachers or tutors, and collaborate with classmates to gain a better understanding of the material.</p><p></p><p>In addition to developing good time management skills and study habits, good students also tend to be organized and disciplined. This means keeping track of assignments, deadlines, and exams, and staying on top of your coursework. It also means avoiding distractions like social media, video games, or other activities that can interfere with your studies. By staying focused and disciplined, you can ensure that you are making the most of your time and achieving your academic goals.</p><p></p><p>Finally, good students tend to be self-motivated and engaged in their learning. This means setting goals for yourself, taking ownership of your education, and finding ways to stay motivated and interested in your coursework. This might involve exploring topics that interest you, pursuing extracurricular activities that align with your goals, or finding ways to apply what you are learning in real-world contexts.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, becoming a good student requires a combination of good time management skills, study habits, organization, discipline, and self-motivation. By developing these skills and behaviors, you can achieve academic success and position yourself for future opportunities. So, start today by setting goals, creating a study schedule, and actively engaging in your coursework. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope it helps!</p><br />

I am also an ordinary individual who wants nothing but a better lifestyle for everyone in the next few days.</p><p></p><p>In the year 2010, face masks and face shields were not introduced.

Public malls, which accommodate thousands of shoppers and guests every day, are also open. Why are schools still not ready to accept students?</p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has surprisingly changed the way people live and work.

The closures of schools and limited techniques to teach students to challenge our country’s literacy rate.</p><p></p><p>During the pandemic, new teaching styles and blended learning which are combinations of two or more methods have been introduced. The pandemic’s negative effect on the educational system is evident as the World Bank reports that Philippine education is disturbing for the year 2021. July 2021, the Malacañang palace expressed alarm over the World Bank report that over 80% of Filipino students fall below the minimum proficiency levels.</p><p></p><p>With the educational crisis our nation is facing, what are the other long-term negative effects will it bring? Will we still deal with the blended learning style or should we shift again to the face-to-face method?</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>You're Welcome&lt;//3</p><br />

It was simply impossible. If you were able to grow enough food for your family to survive, then you were in no position to produce the materials for their clothing. And the food you grew would have been very limited one, maybe two crops with a small vegetable garden on the side. You still had to purchase additional goods to help cook meals and maintain a semblance of variety. You weren't able to produce the nails and horseshoes for your farm and farm animals. If your wagon wheel or plow was damaged, the materials for repair were not readily available. How about that lumber for your home? The point is that you had no self-sufficiency. Time and again, towns were started where the rural folk could gather and begin to build enough custom for the non-farming community to provide much needed specialty services, such as general store, mill and banking.</p><br />
