                        <p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>     I want to change the people, minds of people to be exact. If people change their bad habits and maintain a healthy mind, the world will be a safe and healthy place for future generations to live. Crimes such as robbery occur because we believe it is the simplest way to earn money, but there are legal jobs available to us so why choose the simpliest yet dangerous? Some will also enter a job that could end up hurting our nature. A healthy mind will make a healthy world; if we say we will protect our planet by planting a tree, we must do it. People's mind works different from each, there are some who truly wants our world a better place and some do not care. If we have a healthy mind, we will do what is best for our environment, we will know the good and bad consequences of our actions, injustice will not occur, there will be more honest people, and so on. I want people to be positive and have a good attitude so that our world will be a better place because in the end, we, people, will be the ones who suffer the most if our world dies.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Kung mapipili, gusto ko sana na mapabago ang kahirapan sa mundo. Napakaraming mga tao ang naghihirap sa buong mundo dahil sa kakulangan ng access sa edukasyon, trabaho, at mga basic na serbisyo tulad ng gamot at nutrisyon. Sa panahon ngayon, nakikita natin na kahit na mayroong mga programa at mga solusyon sa kahirapan, hindi pa rin ito naaayon sa lahat ng tao. Sa pamamagitan ng pagbabago ng kahirapan sa mundo, maaaring magkaroon ng mas pantay na oportunidad at pagkakataon ang lahat ng tao na magkaroon ng mas magandang buhay at magsiguro ng mas magandang kinabukasan para sa kanilang mga sarili at sa kanilang mga pamilya.</p><br />

I am just recalling each person’s experience in this cruel world. As a student, we must think of our history especially the wars that is given to us due to jealousy or lack of cooperation for their unity. As my readings and researching, world war one is started began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. This war is started when Archduke was assassinated by people who lives in other country, and the war begin. We all know that, people on that country was so scared of thinking if they will live by the end of the day of that war. In this scenario, we must think of having a justice, by giving your self a forgiveness.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />
