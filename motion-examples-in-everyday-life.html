                                            LABORATORY ACTIVITY
Background: 
Air inside of an inflated balloon consists of individual gas molecules that are in constant motion. These molecules constantly collide with each other as well as with the walls of the balloon and these collisions are what we know as pressure. When the air in the balloon is heated, the gas molecules receive more energy and therefore start to move faster and start hitting the walls of the container with greater force. The result of this greater force is that the volume of the balloon expands. From this example we can see that volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas all have an effect on each other in a given system. Likewise, if we were to pump some more air molecules inside the balloon that would increase the number of collisions with the wall of the balloon, creating more pressure and that would cause the balloon to expand. Today we will directly see the relationship between different measurements of gas and use our data that we collect to graphically show this relationship. Purpose: To identify how pressure, volume, temperature, and the amount of gas are all related to each other and to show how we can graphically represent this relationship. 
Procedure: 
Go to the address below on the internet. http://ch301.cm.utexas.edu/simulations/js/idealgaslaw/ 
The screen will show a simulation of a sample of gas in a cylinder. Click on the picture at the center of the screen to get started. 
To measure the relationship between temperature and volume of a gas (Charles’s Law), this means you will not be varying the pressure in this experiment. Pressure should read the same in all trials. Vary the temperature five different times and read the resulting volume. Enter the data into an appropriate data table. 
To measure the relationship between pressure and volume of a gas (Boyle’s Law), this means you will not be varying the temperature in this experiment. Temperature should read the same in all trials. Vary the volume five different times and read the resulting pressure. Enter the data into an appropriate data table.
To measure the relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas (Gay-Lussac’s Law), this means you will not be varying the volume in this experiment. Volume should read the same in all trials. Vary the temperature five different times and read the resulting pressure. Enter the data into an appropriate data table.
Use Excel to generate graphs for each set of data. Remember to plot the independent and dependent variables on the correct axis, and to include all labels on your graph. 
Questions 
Using the data from the lab explain the relationship between temperature and volume; pressure and volume; and temperature and pressure. Also explain why this happens, making sure you reference information from KMT. 
1.Give a real-world example on where you can see all the above relationships take place in everyday life. Explain how your example fits the relationship shown in the experiments. 
2.Explain why it is dangerous to heat sealed containers. 
3.If you had a balloon at set pressure and set temperature. What would happen to the balloon if more air were added to it? This is called Avogadro’s law. Explain how this works.</a>

                                            The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on. Question :How are you going to differentiate arts from nature. 2.State your reason why art is man-made. 3.How is art related to humanities? ​</a>

</p><p>We can observe a lot of motion-related activities in our daily life. However, different moving things may differ in the manner with which they are moving. For instance, a playing swing exhibits the to-and-fro motion, while movement on a trampoline is up-and-down. Both of them are moving but differently. Based on this, we have different types of motion. Motion can be roughly classified into four categories, namely, linear, rotary, oscillating, and reciprocating.</p><br />

                            5. LABORATORY ACTIVITY
Background: 
Air inside of an inflated balloon consists of individual gas molecules that are in constant motion. These molecules constantly collide with each other as well as with the walls of the balloon and these collisions are what we know as pressure. When the air in the balloon is heated, the gas molecules receive more energy and therefore start to move faster and start hitting the walls of the container with greater force. The result of this greater force is that the volume of the balloon expands. From this example we can see that volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas all have an effect on each other in a given system. Likewise, if we were to pump some more air molecules inside the balloon that would increase the number of collisions with the wall of the balloon, creating more pressure and that would cause the balloon to expand. Today we will directly see the relationship between different measurements of gas and use our data that we collect to graphically show this relationship. Purpose: To identify how pressure, volume, temperature, and the amount of gas are all related to each other and to show how we can graphically represent this relationship. 
Procedure: 
Go to the address below on the internet. http://ch301.cm.utexas.edu/simulations/js/idealgaslaw/ 
The screen will show a simulation of a sample of gas in a cylinder. Click on the picture at the center of the screen to get started. 
To measure the relationship between temperature and volume of a gas (Charles’s Law), this means you will not be varying the pressure in this experiment. Pressure should read the same in all trials. Vary the temperature five different times and read the resulting volume. Enter the data into an appropriate data table. 
To measure the relationship between pressure and volume of a gas (Boyle’s Law), this means you will not be varying the temperature in this experiment. Temperature should read the same in all trials. Vary the volume five different times and read the resulting pressure. Enter the data into an appropriate data table.
To measure the relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas (Gay-Lussac’s Law), this means you will not be varying the volume in this experiment. Volume should read the same in all trials. Vary the temperature five different times and read the resulting pressure. Enter the data into an appropriate data table.
Use Excel to generate graphs for each set of data. Remember to plot the independent and dependent variables on the correct axis, and to include all labels on your graph. 
Questions 
Using the data from the lab explain the relationship between temperature and volume; pressure and volume; and temperature and pressure. Also explain why this happens, making sure you reference information from KMT. 
1.Give a real-world example on where you can see all the above relationships take place in everyday life. Explain how your example fits the relationship shown in the experiments. 
2.Explain why it is dangerous to heat sealed containers. 
3.If you had a balloon at set pressure and set temperature. What would happen to the balloon if more air were added to it? This is called Avogadro’s law. Explain how this works.</h2><br />

His name was Melu, and when he sat on the clouds, which were his home, he occupied all the space above. His teeth were pure gold, and because he was very cleanly and continually rubbed himself with his hands, his skin became pure white. The dead skin which he rubbed off his body was placed on one side in a pile, and by and by this pile became so large that he was annoyed and set himself to consider what he could do with it.</p><p>2 Finally Melu decided to make the earth; so he worked very hard in putting the dead skin into shape, and when it was finished he was so pleased with it that he determined to make two beings like himself, though smaller, to live on it.</p><p>3 Taking the remnants of the material left after making the earth he fashioned two men, but just as they were all finished except their noses, Tau Tana from below the earth appeared and wanted to help him.</p><p>4 Melu did not wish any assistance, and a great argument ensued.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kayorama nano ha</p><br />

Motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement, distance, velocity, acceleration, speed, and time. The motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame with change in time. The branch of physics describing the motion of objects without reference to its cause is kinematics; the branch studying forces and their effect on motion is dynamics.</p>example:Wind.

                            13. The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on.
