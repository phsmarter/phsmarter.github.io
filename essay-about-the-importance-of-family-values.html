Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

Read the argumentative essay and complete the argument chart.Topic:Claim:Arguments:a.b.C.d.Counterarguments:a100Note: An argument shows support for the author's claim (for example: reasons, evidence, data and statistics) while a counterargument explains the opposite point of view.   individualism is a fundamental part of a society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</a>

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</a>

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

For many months, he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom,and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that it was all he wanted.As graduation day was approaching, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morningof his graduation, his father called him into his private study room. His father told him how much he loved him. He handed his sona beautiful wrapped gift box Curious but somehow disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather-boundBible. Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said,"With all your money, you give me a Bible?" and stormed out of the house, leaving the holy book.Many years passed and the young man was very successful in his business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family.He realized his father was very old and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Beforehe could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away and willed all of his possessions to hisson. He needed to come home immediately and took care of things.When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search his father's importantpapers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it few years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn pages. Ashe read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealerwho had the sports car he had desired.

Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</h2><br />

Finally, on the morningof his graduation, his father called him into his private study room. His father told him how much he loved him. He handed his sona beautiful wrapped gift box Curious but somehow disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather-boundBible. Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said,"With all your money, you give me a Bible?" and stormed out of the house, leaving the holy book.Many years passed and the young man was very successful in his business.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons. First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore. Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced. Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing.​</h2><br />
