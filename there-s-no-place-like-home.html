                                            Lessons One Can Learn About Life from a DogThere are so many lessons one can learn about life from a dog. Imagine this scenario; it s Taining heavily oursite and you need to leave for someone's house. The dog is up and eager to 80 with you You tell it to stay home. As you leave, you see it squeezing out through the gap in the doorway. You scald it and order it back home. Then at every turn you make, you suddenly follow you sheepishly at a distance. It follows at a risk of being reprimanded for the sore reason of being somewhere nearby, How else can we experience so selfless aninstance of love and faithfulness? We can learn a lifelong lesson from this sincere warm displayof perpetual companionship.Observe the eating habit of your dog. It does not eat, except when hungry. It does notdrink, unless it is thirsty, it does not gorge Itself. It stops eating when it had enough. A dog also sets a perfect example of adaptability, if it moved to a strange place, it is able to adapt itself to that place and to its thousand peculiarities without a murmur of complaint. It is able to learn and adapt to a new family's ways and customs it is quick and ready to please Man, being accustomed to comfort and wealth will be lost if suddenly stripped of all he is accustomed to A dog also teaches us a thing or two about, unselfish love: When a dog knows death is approaching, it tries, with its last vestige of strength, to crawl away elsewhere to die, in order toburden its owners no more A dog does things with all vigor, However, when there is nothing to do, it lies down and rests, it does not waste its strength and energy needlessly. Many working people are burning the candles at both ends. Many suffer nervous breakdowns due to stress. Perhaps, they should learn to rest like a dog does.SUMMARY​</a>

                                            " THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER"Once upon a time, in a a forest far away, there lived a woodpecker. The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.--------------------------------The map below is called the story grammar map. Write the missing elements of the story in it.

It has affected everything and everyone. It has taken lives and is continuouslyinfecting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, around the world. To date, scientistsand health experts are still working together to discover a vaccine as a means to cureand to stop the spread of the aforesaid virus. Currently, the best ways for people not tocontract the virus are to observe proper hygiene, frequent hand washing, and use ofmask and alcohol anytime, anywhere, and everywhere they go. Equally important, is tostrengthen one’s immune system by eating healthy and nutritious food, having enoughrest and sleep, as well as doing healthy exercises. Furthermore, staying at home andstrictly observing physical distancing are also some of the best measures in avoiding thecontraction of the virus.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME1.)____________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER2.)___________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE3.)___________========================It’s Adverb Harvest Time!Read the text below and pick all the adverbs you can see, and then put them inthe column where they belong in the table provided below.Man and FaithBy Eneri S. OgeinamBowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilienceare again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one isexempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying7loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also, on a lighter note,it came as a great global equalizer.This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and severaluniversal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary.Our life, our wealth, and all possessions we have, including our own skills andknowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even themost powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything isunpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation,we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go, and our social connectionsand interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations, and all things we hold dearly,with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftlybecomes volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA worldwhere all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change.And the very question is, “Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on thegovernment, family, and friends for help?As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More thanever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faithto a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps usgoing¢ and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and hugechanges in this “new normal”. We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, wecontinue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive always. We learn how to look at thebrighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, ourfaith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life’s challenges. Therefore, let us holdonto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble norfear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of virusessuch as this COVID-19.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME4.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE5.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER6.)______________</a>

                            17. Lessons One Can Learn About Life from a DogThere are so many lessons one can learn about life from a dog. Imagine this scenario; it s Taining heavily oursite and you need to leave for someone's house. The dog is up and eager to 80 with you You tell it to stay home. As you leave, you see it squeezing out through the gap in the doorway. You scald it and order it back home. Then at every turn you make, you suddenly follow you sheepishly at a distance. It follows at a risk of being reprimanded for the sore reason of being somewhere nearby, How else can we experience so selfless aninstance of love and faithfulness? We can learn a lifelong lesson from this sincere warm displayof perpetual companionship.Observe the eating habit of your dog. It does not eat, except when hungry. It does notdrink, unless it is thirsty, it does not gorge Itself. It stops eating when it had enough. A dog also sets a perfect example of adaptability, if it moved to a strange place, it is able to adapt itself to that place and to its thousand peculiarities without a murmur of complaint. It is able to learn and adapt to a new family's ways and customs it is quick and ready to please Man, being accustomed to comfort and wealth will be lost if suddenly stripped of all he is accustomed to A dog also teaches us a thing or two about, unselfish love: When a dog knows death is approaching, it tries, with its last vestige of strength, to crawl away elsewhere to die, in order toburden its owners no more A dog does things with all vigor, However, when there is nothing to do, it lies down and rests, it does not waste its strength and energy needlessly. Many working people are burning the candles at both ends. Many suffer nervous breakdowns due to stress. Perhaps, they should learn to rest like a dog does.SUMMARY​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Dogs are indeed wonderful companions and can teach us many valuable lessons about life. Some of the lessons that one can learn from a dog include the importance of loyalty, the value of adaptability, the virtue of moderation in eating and drinking, the value of unselfish love, and the importance of rest and relaxation. Dogs are known for their unwavering loyalty and faithfulness to their owners, and they can serve as an example of how to be a loyal and faithful friend to others. They are also highly adaptable animals, and they can quickly learn and adapt to new environments and situations. This ability to adapt can serve as a reminder to us to be flexible and open to change. Dogs also demonstrate the value of moderation in their eating and drinking habits, and they can serve as a reminder to us to not overindulge or engage in excess. In addition, dogs are known for their selfless love and devotion to their owners, and they can teach us about the power of unselfish love and compassion. Finally, dogs also understand the importance of rest and relaxation, and they can serve as a reminder to us to take time to relax and recharge.</p><p></p><br />

                            18. " THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER"Once upon a time, in a a forest far away, there lived a woodpecker. The woodpecker lived in a tree in which he slept all night and worked all day.In the tree next door, there came to live an owl who liked to work all night and slept all day.The woodpecker worked so hard and made so much noise that his tapping woke the owl. You see, a woodpecker pecks at the wood and makes a continuous tapping sound."I say, you there!" screeched the owl. "How can I possibly sleep with all that noise going on?""This is my three," the woodpecker said, "and I shall tap it as I please."The owl lost his temper. His screeches and hoots echoed through the forest and animals for miles came running to see what was the matter."You carry on tapping, Master Woodpecker," squeked the mouse. "Owl is always bossing and chasing us about,""Oh, do be quiet," growled the bear, "Woodpecker, stop tapping and let Owl sleep. We like a peaceful life around here."Angrily, the owl swooped down on the small animals who ran for their lives and hid in all kinds of curious places. "Bully," they shouted when they were very safe.Then the owl ask the bigger animals what he could do to stop the noise but they all shook their heads. "How should we know?" they said. "You are the wise and clever one. Perhaps you could move to another tree.""Why should I?" snapped the owl. "I like living in this tree. That noisy woodpecker must move."But the woodpecker would not move. Day after day, his noisy tapping kept the owl awake. And day after the day the became more and more bad-tempered. He began to be so crotchety and rude that all the other animals decided that something must be done.So they held a meeting."Something must be dome," said the badger."Woodpecker was here first, so owl must leave.""But he says he will not leave his tree," replied the Deer"In that case we shall have to push down the tree, and then he will have to leave," said the crafty Fox.That night, while the owl was out hunting they all tried to push down tree. But no matter how hard they pushed and pulled and panted they could not move the tree the smallest bit. So they gave up and went back home.Some time later, two strangers came to the forest. They were a pair of beavers, and the took fancy to the owl's tree, and started to gnaw at the trunk.Every day they gnawed a little more, until it seemed as if they would gnaw the trunk right through.Then one day a great storm shook the forest. The wind roared through the trees. It was so strong the woodpecker gave up tapping, and so for once, the owl slept in peace. The owl's tree began to creak and crack and groan as the wind grew more and more fierce, but the tired owl slept soundly on.Suddenly the woodpecker saw the owl's tree begin to away and fall. At once he struggled bravely through the storm and tapped loudly close to the owl's ear to wake him. The owl woke up in a fury, hearing the woodpecker tapping on his tree, but when realized his tree was being blown down his anger quickly disappeared. Together the woodpecker and the owl struggled to safety just as the tree crashed to the ground.Then the storm died away, and the owl thanked the woodpecker for saving his life. Now he was glad that the woodpecker had been his neighbor.--------------------------------The map below is called the story grammar map. Write the missing elements of the story in it.

It has affected everything and everyone. It has taken lives and is continuouslyinfecting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, around the world. To date, scientistsand health experts are still working together to discover a vaccine as a means to cureand to stop the spread of the aforesaid virus. Currently, the best ways for people not tocontract the virus are to observe proper hygiene, frequent hand washing, and use ofmask and alcohol anytime, anywhere, and everywhere they go. Equally important, is tostrengthen one’s immune system by eating healthy and nutritious food, having enoughrest and sleep, as well as doing healthy exercises. Furthermore, staying at home andstrictly observing physical distancing are also some of the best measures in avoiding thecontraction of the virus.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME1.)____________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER2.)___________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE3.)___________========================It’s Adverb Harvest Time!Read the text below and pick all the adverbs you can see, and then put them inthe column where they belong in the table provided below.Man and FaithBy Eneri S. OgeinamBowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilienceare again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one isexempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying7loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also, on a lighter note,it came as a great global equalizer.This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and severaluniversal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary.Our life, our wealth, and all possessions we have, including our own skills andknowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even themost powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything isunpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation,we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go, and our social connectionsand interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations, and all things we hold dearly,with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftlybecomes volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA worldwhere all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change.And the very question is, “Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on thegovernment, family, and friends for help?As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More thanever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faithto a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps usgoing¢ and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and hugechanges in this “new normal”. We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, wecontinue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive always. We learn how to look at thebrighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, ourfaith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life’s challenges. Therefore, let us holdonto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble norfear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of virusessuch as this COVID-19.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME4.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE5.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER6.)______________</h2><br />
