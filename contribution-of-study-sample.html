                                            College students are often considered a bellwether of Internet use, but the Internet is not the only technology they have incorporated into everyday life. Thanks to a plethora of technologies (video game consoles, computers, handheld devices, Internet) a range of entertainment options is at their disposal, a range that is much wider than was available to their predecessors. Furthermore, today’s college students are using technologies like cell phones, mp3 players and other devices to entertain themselves wherever they may be. The goal of this study was to learn about college students’ use of video, computer and online games, and to determine the impact of that use on their everyday life. To meet those goals the researchers used three approaches. First, surveys were randomly distributed to college students at a wide range of two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities in the continental United States. Students from 27 colleges and universities participated and the surveys were collected between March 2002 and June 2002, and September 2002 and October 2002. This sample was intended to produce results that would correspond to the demographics for all U.S. college students as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual almanac issue.10 The sample was tested against known population parameters (gender, race, age) and found to be reflective of the national population of college students. In all, 1,162 surveys were returned. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points. This study focused on traditional college students, ones who are seeking a college degree and who devote much or all of their time to their studies. Second, a team of graduate student researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was recruited to observe the behaviors of college students at 10 Chicago area institutions of higher education. The researchers were trained in ethnographic methods of observation and data collecting, and rotated the times of the day and days of the week they spent in various public settings where college students could be found using computers and the Internet. Third, additional material was based on a previous study of college students’ Internet use conducted by this research team for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project11 and on the findings of surveys of Americans about their use of the Internet conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 2001 and 2002 for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.1.

________1. A research title capsulizes the main thought or idea of the whole research paper and it also
reflects the variables under study.
________2. In writing the significance of the study, the researcher should start from specific to general
contribution.
________ 3. Controversial topic should be avoided in writing a research paper because it is prone to
opinions of the subject.
________ 4. You can narrow down the topic by exploring and extending the explanation of a theory and
by focusing on a specific group.
________ 5. A research question should not be answerable with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but rather
requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to composition of an answer.
________ 6. In writing the title of a qualitative research, it is always necessary to complete all the data
that answers what, where, who, and when even though it’s too long.
_________7. A research question should be arguable. Its potential answers are open to debate rather
than accepted facts.
________ 8. Research is usually limited in scope by sample size, time and geographic area; while the
delimitation of study is the description of the scope of study.
_________9. Research titles that start with indefinite adjectives such as several, many, some, etc., make
the topic vague.
________ 10. Your problem statement can guide you in identifying the specific contribution of your study.</a>

It is a problem that affects all students, the person who bully, those who are victims, and the persons who witnesses to interpersonal violence. Bullying may include verbal and physical assaults, threats, 'jokes' or language, mockery and criticizing, insulting behavior and facial expressions. These factors work individually, or collectively, to contribute to a child's likelihood of bullying. Bullying is difficult to eradicate in schools because it is so often effectively used by students. Teachers as professionals have to deal with the consequences of pupil-on-pupil bullying. The impact of prejudice-related bullying should not be underestimated. Bullying must be recognized, understood and taken seriously. The major objectives of this study were (i)To understand the nature of bullying (ii)To find out the causes of bullying (iii) To find out impact of pupil-on-pupil bullying on students 'learning. 10 teachers and 40 students were constituted as sample of the study. Simple random sampling technique was used to select respondents. Restricted response questionnaire was used as research tool for the collection of data about prejudice-based bullying in schools. Collected data were analyzed through SPSS by running frequencies, mean score, percentage and standard deviation. The findings of the study revealed that the most commonly mentioned cause of bullying behavior was power fullness (for example, I depend on myself rather than other) and physical (for example, hitting and punching) abuse. There is an urgent need to develop anti bullying policies in schools to identify and find ways of enabling pupils to seek out the help that they needed.

1. ... South Africa is a diverse society with multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic,
and multi-lingual attributes. It is a country that has a rich history, a history that has
contributed to how people of this society construct their lives, their identities, their
behaviors and their world-views. This study made use of this diverse context by
choosing a sample from the wide population that could be experiencing similar
challenges. The target population for this study was Black women who have
professional careers.
Nwoye further argues that in traditional African societies individuals operate
within a community and one's identity is largely influenced by sharing and
acknowledging cultural principles. He also suggests that the communal identification
comes with multiple obligations and loyalties. For example, amongst Black South
Africans in particular, there are cultural practices relating to marriage, which will be
discussed in detail in subsequent sections. These cultural practices can be seen as
socially constructed loyalties to which people adhere.</a>

                            14. College students are often considered a bellwether of Internet use, but the Internet is not the only technology they have incorporated into everyday life. Thanks to a plethora of technologies (video game consoles, computers, handheld devices, Internet) a range of entertainment options is at their disposal, a range that is much wider than was available to their predecessors. Furthermore, today’s college students are using technologies like cell phones, mp3 players and other devices to entertain themselves wherever they may be. The goal of this study was to learn about college students’ use of video, computer and online games, and to determine the impact of that use on their everyday life. To meet those goals the researchers used three approaches. First, surveys were randomly distributed to college students at a wide range of two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities in the continental United States. Students from 27 colleges and universities participated and the surveys were collected between March 2002 and June 2002, and September 2002 and October 2002. This sample was intended to produce results that would correspond to the demographics for all U.S. college students as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual almanac issue.10 The sample was tested against known population parameters (gender, race, age) and found to be reflective of the national population of college students. In all, 1,162 surveys were returned. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points. This study focused on traditional college students, ones who are seeking a college degree and who devote much or all of their time to their studies. Second, a team of graduate student researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was recruited to observe the behaviors of college students at 10 Chicago area institutions of higher education. The researchers were trained in ethnographic methods of observation and data collecting, and rotated the times of the day and days of the week they spent in various public settings where college students could be found using computers and the Internet. Third, additional material was based on a previous study of college students’ Internet use conducted by this research team for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project11 and on the findings of surveys of Americans about their use of the Internet conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 2001 and 2002 for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.1.

It is a problem that affects all students, the person who bully, those who are victims, and the persons who witnesses to interpersonal violence. Bullying may include verbal and physical assaults, threats, 'jokes' or language, mockery and criticizing, insulting behavior and facial expressions. These factors work individually, or collectively, to contribute to a child's likelihood of bullying. Bullying is difficult to eradicate in schools because it is so often effectively used by students. Teachers as professionals have to deal with the consequences of pupil-on-pupil bullying. The impact of prejudice-related bullying should not be underestimated. Bullying must be recognized, understood and taken seriously. The major objectives of this study were (i)To understand the nature of bullying (ii)To find out the causes of bullying (iii) To find out impact of pupil-on-pupil bullying on students 'learning. 10 teachers and 40 students were constituted as sample of the study. Simple random sampling technique was used to select respondents. Restricted response questionnaire was used as research tool for the collection of data about prejudice-based bullying in schools. Collected data were analyzed through SPSS by running frequencies, mean score, percentage and standard deviation. The findings of the study revealed that the most commonly mentioned cause of bullying behavior was power fullness (for example, I depend on myself rather than other) and physical (for example, hitting and punching) abuse. There is an urgent need to develop anti bullying policies in schools to identify and find ways of enabling pupils to seek out the help that they needed.

Collaboration is widely recognized as the best way for libraries to cope with the ever increasing challenges: volume of information resources, nature and quality of information, user needs and expectations, information and communication technology competencies and infrastructure, Inflated cost of information resources and staffing needs. However, although these challenges have continued to prevalt, libraries working under collaborative initiatives like the Consortium of Academic and research Libraries in Illinois (CARL) have registered tremendous success. This research reports the findings of a thorough study to establish the factors that have led to the success of CARLI and how such success factors can be applied in libraries of developing countries like Uganda. Emphasis is placed on the establishment of CARLI leadership, the sharing of responsibility and decision making process, as well as sources of funding for the consortium... Also central to the research study is exploration of the role and responsibility of participating member libraries and their contributions to and expectations from the consortium. This present study has incorporated interviews with CARLI staff and a questionnaire survey to all the participatingCARLI membership1_________are/is involved in the study. 2.The study was conducted at ____3.The study was conducted in ____4.The present study is all about ____5.The study was conducted to_____pa help po​​</h2><br />

1. ... South Africa is a diverse society with multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic,
and multi-lingual attributes. It is a country that has a rich history, a history that has
contributed to how people of this society construct their lives, their identities, their
behaviors and their world-views. This study made use of this diverse context by
choosing a sample from the wide population that could be experiencing similar
challenges. The target population for this study was Black women who have
professional careers.
Nwoye further argues that in traditional African societies individuals operate
within a community and one's identity is largely influenced by sharing and
acknowledging cultural principles. He also suggests that the communal identification
comes with multiple obligations and loyalties. For example, amongst Black South
Africans in particular, there are cultural practices relating to marriage, which will be
discussed in detail in subsequent sections. These cultural practices can be seen as
socially constructed loyalties to which people adhere.</h2><br />

                            29. Sample 2 With diminishing finances, it is rarely possible for a library of information center to have enough resources to fulfil the needs of its clients... Collaboration is widely recognized as the best way for libraries to cope with the ever increasing challenges: volume of information resources, nature and quality of information, user needs and expectations, information and communication technology competencies and infrastructure, inflated cost of information resources and staffing needs. However, although these challenges have continued to prevail, libraries working under collaborative initiatives like the Consortium of Academic and research Libraries in Illinois (CARL) have registered tremendous success. This research reports the findings of a thorough study to establish the factors that have led to the success of CARLI and how such success factors can be applied in libraries of developing countries like Uganda. Emphasis is placed on the establishment of CARLI leadership, the sharing of responsibility and decision making process, as well as sources of funding for the consortium... Also central to the research study is exploration of the role and responsibility of participating member libraries and their contributions to and expectations from the consortium. This present study has incorporated interviews with CARLI staff and a questionnaire survey to all the participating CARLI membership.
