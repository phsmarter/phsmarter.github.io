                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                                            "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</a>

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

                        <p><strong>NUMBER</strong><strong> </strong><strong>1</strong></p><p>Why is the story “The Wedding at Cana” important in the life of every Christian</p><p>because Jesus performed His first miracle at a wedding in the city of Cana. When the hosts ran out of wine to serve the guests, Mary had total confidence that her son, Jesus, would take care of the situation. He miraculously turned plain water into excellent wine.The exact location of Cana is not known. It is west of the Sea of Galilee. It is close enough to Nazareth and the area around the Jordan that Jesus, his mother and Jesus’ disciples were all guests at the wedding.</p><p><strong>NUMBER</strong><strong> </strong><strong>2</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>The feast was a big part of the wedding custom. It would have been shameful for the host to run out of wine for his guests. Mary must have been well acquainted with the host because she saw it as her responsibility to help with the problem. She also seems to have charge over the servants since she gave them orders to obey Jesus. Perhaps this was a relative or even another of Mary’s children (Jesus’ sibling) who was getting married.<strong>NUMBER</strong><strong> </strong><strong>3</strong></p><p>It is interesting that Mary trusts Jesus to fix the problem. We know that he has not performed a public miracle before this time (verse 11). In what way did Mary know that Jesus would solve the problem? She may or may not have expected him to perform a miracle. Jesus knew that his power was not given to him for his own gratification. He reminds Mary that what she is asking him to do is not of the magnitude that his purpose on earth was. Whatever Mary’s expectations might have been, they were surpassed. Jesus miraculously produced some more wine. He ordered the servants to fill six stone water jars with water. These were not special jars. They were used to hold water used in ceremonies. The text says that the jars were quite large (verse 6).</p><p>Jesus then ordered the servants to take a sample from the jars. This was to be given to the man in charge of the banquet. When he tasted it – it was wine! The water had been miraculously turned to wine!..It was not just any wine – it was excellent wine. Usually guests were served the best wine at the beginning of the banquet. After they had been satisfied with wine then their taste was dulled. That is when the inferior (cheaper) wine was brought out. In this case the person in charge thought the bridegroom might have made a mistake. The wine that Jesus had produced was the best wine of the nigth</p><br />

Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Hello everyone, my name is [insert name], and I am excited to talk to you today about the importance of friendship in our lives. As the famous quote goes, "Life is better with friends," and I couldn't agree more. We all need friends in our lives, whether it's to share our joys or to lean on during tough times. Today, I will share some insights on why friendships are important and how they can enhance our lives.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, friendships provide us with a sense of belonging. As human beings, we all have an innate need to feel connected to others, and friends fulfill that need by accepting us for who we are. They provide a safe space where we can be ourselves without fear of judgment. Moreover, studies have shown that people with strong social connections are generally happier and healthier than those who lack social support.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, friendships provide us with emotional support. Life can be challenging, and we all face difficult times at some point. Having friends who we can talk to, confide in, and seek advice from can help us navigate these tough times. Friends offer a listening ear, empathy, and a shoulder to cry on. They can provide us with the encouragement and motivation we need to keep going.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, friendships provide us with fun and laughter. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and having friends to share experiences with can make life more enjoyable. Whether it's going to the movies, trying out new restaurants, or simply hanging out at home, friends can make ordinary moments extraordinary. Laughter is also contagious, and friends can lift our moods and brighten up our days.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, friendships are essential for our emotional, mental, and physical well-being. They provide us with a sense of belonging, emotional support, and fun and laughter. So, I encourage you to cherish the friendships in your life and make an effort to nurture them. Remember, life is better with friends.</p><p></p><p>Advice:</p><p></p><p>If you are struggling to make friends, try joining groups or clubs that align with your interests. This will give you the opportunity to meet like-minded people and build relationships based on shared passions. Also, be open to making new friends, even if they don't fit the mold of your ideal friend. Sometimes, the most unlikely friendships can be the most fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>Question:</p><p></p><p>What are some ways you can show appreciation for your friends and strengthen your friendships?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                            17. "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</h2><br />

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.
