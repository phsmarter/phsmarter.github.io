                        <p>The answer is <strong>4. </strong></p><p>Please see https://brainly.ph/question/1949611 for the explanation. But basically, since each sister has 2 more sisters than brothers, and the narrator also has 2 more sisters than brothers, the narrator is a girl.</p><p>Now, since she's a girl, the youngest brother has 4 more sisters than brothers, 3 from the 3 sisters (2 sisters and narrator), and 1 more because he has to remove himself from the count of brothers of the girls.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><br />

                            3. I have two more sisters than brothers. Each of my sisters has two more sisters than brothers. How many more sisters than brothers does my youngest brother have?</h2><br />
                        <p>This is a really interesting puzzle!</p><p>The speaker can either be a girl or a boy.</p><p>If the speaker is a girl, then:</p>We have at least three girls, the speaker (SP), and two sisters (S1, S2). Each sister would have two more sisters than brothers, the two sisters being the speaker, and the other sister earlier mentioned. For example, S1 would have S2 and SP as sisters.The youngest brother has <strong>4</strong> more sisters than brothers, because he has SP, S1, and S2 as sisters. Also, he has to remove himself from the count of the brothers.<p>If the speaker is a boy, then:</p>We have at least two girls (S1, S2), and the speaker (SP) is a boy.S1 has two more sisters than brothers, so she has S2, and S3. But, if S3 is her sister, S3 is also SP's sister. Thus, SP would have 3 more sisters than brothers. This is a contradiction with the first point. So, SP cannot be a boy.<p>Since SP is not a boy, she is a girl. From the conclusion in that part, the final answer is <strong>4.</strong></p><p>To illustrate, let's let B1 ... BN be the boys, and G1 ... GN be the girls.</p><p>We know that there are at least 3 girls, and 1 boy (the youngest brother).</p><p>In the case of G1 G2 G3 B1, G1 has 2 sisters and 1 brother. This is wrong because G1 has "two more sisters than brothers".</p><p>Then, we can have G1 G2 G3 G4 B1. This works because each girl has 3 sisters and 1 brother. So, all have "two more sisters than brothers". Again, here, B1 has no brothers (0), and 4 sisters, so the difference is <strong>4</strong> <strong>.</strong></p><p>What about if we add another sister? So the kids are G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 B1. Each girl has 4 sisters and 1 brother, so 4 - 1 = 3, which is a contradiction since the difference should be 2. </p><p>We can add another brother though, for example, G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 B1 B2. Each girl has 4 sisters and 2 brothers, so 4 - 2 = 2, correct. Each brother would have 5 - 1 = 4 sisters, still. </p><p>So from our base of G1 G2  G3 G4 B1, we can add pairs of girls and boys, and the puzzle would still work. And, the answer would still be <strong>4.</strong></p><p>Hope this helps!</p><br /><br />
