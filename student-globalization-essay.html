Writeyour answer on the blank.As our world recognizes increased globalization, 21st century learning refers to the skills and technologies that will position our students to succeed in a world that ever increasingly requires collaboration, critical thinking, adaptability, grit, perseverance and relies less on the learning of facts and data. The how and why of learning becomes central and is far more important than the what or who from past models. Students must approach lifelong learning with a flexible mindset as they tackle 21st century issues. They must learn to work with and listen to a variety of points of view.Technology plays a big part in 21st century learning. The use of podcasts, audio and video blogs and online learning all play into how education is moving and is significant in high schools and universities. The Internet is the connection to our global world. Students will acquire internet navigation skills as they move through our program. The vast array of resources on the Internet provides a wealth of data and students will learn to filter the essential from the nonessential; to incorporate visual images and graphics. The use of the interactive White Board is a valuable classroom tool. Students will have facility with iPads and laptop computers.

                                            Instructions: Read the example of an argumentative essay below.  
Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

Then, write the hook and the thesis statement on the boxes below._____ According to recent reports, cigarette smoking in youth is getting serious. Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2011 (GYTS), a school-based national survey, showed that 13.7 percent of students are currently using tobacco. Although 92 percent of the surveyed schools already included tobacco control in their curriculum, it was not a priority in schools, division offices, and local government units. Thus, the Department of Education (DepEd) called for the effective implementation of a cohesive and comprehensive tobacco control program in schools through a new policy, DepEd Order No. 48, s. 2016._____ However, despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Ultimately, students should be intensively educated on the harms of tobacco use and health hazards of smoking including giving corrective actions to offenders. This is not only to save them from the “slow death” but to secure the nation’s public and economic health in the future.____ Therefore, DepEd Order No. 48 is a very vital policy, which should be followed and applied to all schools and DepEd offices to completely trash the ash and for everyone to savor a breath of fresh air.____ No surprise, cigarette smoking can literally “take your breath away.” It’s no secret that tobacco has finally been linked to being a bad drug which wreaks havoc on your body. Its avoidance is a general goal but for many years now, the issue on cigarette smoking particularly in schools still hasn’t declined. That’s why we should advocate in educating the youth on the adverse effects of tobacco and make it clear that just starting to smoke can end up giving them lifetime problems.Hook: _____________Thesis Statement: ____________​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A holistic approach to education – that addresses students’ learning, social and emotional needs – is crucial, especially in times of crisis. School closures related to the current COVID-19 pandemic mean that students from diverse backgrounds who are more at risk of increased vulnerability are less likely to receive the support and extra services they need, and the gap between students that experience additional barriers and that do not might widen. Closures can also have considerable effects on students’ sense of belonging to schools and their feelings of self-worth – these are key for inclusion in education.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>follow mo Ako ❤️</p><p></p><br />

Audience: Your classmates and teachers.
Situation: In this time that your generation’s (Generation Z) sense of nationalism, is being challenged by globalization, you are tasked to reflect and ask yourself about how much love you have for your country. You should share your own experience, which you think is comparable to the experiences of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization in their struggle to achieve freedom and unity. You should also suggest ways on how your generation can deepen the sense of nationalism.
Performance: As you write your essay, you should consider the following:
1. For your introduction, choose one of the struggles experienced by the Filipinos during the Spanish period. Explain how these struggles affect their lives as native Filipinos.
2. For the body of your essay, relate these struggles with your own experiences by citing instances where you encountered struggles in your life and how you were able to cope with them.
3. For your conclusion, as a student explain how these struggles helped deepen your sense of nationalism. You may cite ways on how a student like you can deepen the sense of nationalism.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Read the explanation :).</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. As the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere increases due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, the Earth's temperature rises, leading to climate change.</p><p></p><p>2. As a student, the changing of seasons can affect your mood, energy levels, and productivity, which can impact your academic performance. In this time of pandemic, the changing of seasons can also affect your mental health due to limited social interactions and increased stress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>3. We can lessen air pollutants by reducing our use of fossil fuels, promoting the use of renewable energy sources, improving public transportation systems, and enforcing stricter regulations on industrial emissions. We can also practice sustainable habits such as reducing waste and composting to help improve air quality.</p><p></p><p>4. Three superstitious beliefs about eclipses include that they are a sign of impending doom or disaster, that they are caused by mythical creatures devouring the sun or moon, and that pregnant women should avoid looking at eclipses to prevent harm to their unborn child.</p><p></p><p>5. Superstitious beliefs about eclipses are unreliable because they are not based on scientific evidence and have been debunked by modern astronomy. Eclipses are predictable astronomical events that occur due to the alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth, and do not have any supernatural or harmful effects on humans.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Solar radiation trapped in our atmosphere because of too many greenhouse gasesVery hot temperature, it is normal that the temperature is higher during summer but nowadays temperature is extemely hot.Just do 3R's Reduce reuse recycle, lessen the emmision of carbon dioxide and lessen the consumption of water and electricity.They thought the world would come to an end or a great evil would follow.Eclipses are evil omens that bring death and destruction.Pregnant women should not go outside during an eclipse, as it is believed that the eclipse can harm the unborn child.Because there is no evidence or proof proving that the beliefs of the people are true or fact.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong</p><p>pa brainliest po</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If I have to go to a certain place, I can just use a bike or just walk. In this case, I won't be able to contribute to the pollution because I won't generate harmful smoke. I can also encourage my friends to do the same. Riding a vehicle may be convenient but the negative effects it can cause is the issue. If the place is just near, try to reach it without putting the environment at stake. </p><p></p><p>Another thing is, I will avoid burning garbages especially plastic. The smoke from burning plastic isn't good for the environment and to our health. Instead, I will try to recycle these plastics to make something useful out of them. I will practice proper waste management to separate biodegrable to non-biodegrable. I will start this in our home then continue to do it in our school. </p><p></p><p>There are a lot of things I can do even if I'm still a student. The best way is to be a role model in promoting the advocacy of taking care of our environment. If we will not take any action about the issue, then we will be the one to suffer in the end. If I want to make a change in our environment, the change should start with me. </p><p></p><p></p><p>(Hi, I saw your post about no one answering your question so here it is. I hope it will help you.

Writeyour answer on the blank.As our world recognizes increased globalization, 21st century learning refers to the skills and technologies that will position our students to succeed in a world that ever increasingly requires collaboration, critical thinking, adaptability, grit, perseverance and relies less on the learning of facts and data. The how and why of learning becomes central and is far more important than the what or who from past models. Students must approach lifelong learning with a flexible mindset as they tackle 21st century issues. They must learn to work with and listen to a variety of points of view.Technology plays a big part in 21st century learning. The use of podcasts, audio and video blogs and online learning all play into how education is moving and is significant in high schools and universities. The Internet is the connection to our global world. Students will acquire internet navigation skills as they move through our program. The vast array of resources on the Internet provides a wealth of data and students will learn to filter the essential from the nonessential; to incorporate visual images and graphics. The use of the interactive White Board is a valuable classroom tool. Students will have facility with iPads and laptop computers.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

Although 92 percent of the surveyed schools already included tobacco control in their curriculum, it was not a priority in schools, division offices, and local government units. Thus, the Department of Education (DepEd) called for the effective implementation of a cohesive and comprehensive tobacco control program in schools through a new policy, DepEd Order No. 48, s. 2016._____ However, despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Ultimately, students should be intensively educated on the harms of tobacco use and health hazards of smoking including giving corrective actions to offenders. This is not only to save them from the “slow death” but to secure the nation’s public and economic health in the future.____ Therefore, DepEd Order No. 48 is a very vital policy, which should be followed and applied to all schools and DepEd offices to completely trash the ash and for everyone to savor a breath of fresh air.____ No surprise, cigarette smoking can literally “take your breath away.” It’s no secret that tobacco has finally been linked to being a bad drug which wreaks havoc on your body. Its avoidance is a general goal but for many years now, the issue on cigarette smoking particularly in schools still hasn’t declined. That’s why we should advocate in educating the youth on the adverse effects of tobacco and make it clear that just starting to smoke can end up giving them lifetime problems.Hook: _____________Thesis Statement: ____________​</h2><br />

Do you agree or disagree? Use facts, statistics, and studies to supplement your views.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a world where globalization has become the norm, the ability to understand and speak a foreign language has become increasingly important. I strongly agree that learning a foreign language is critical for several reasons. Firstly, it allows individuals to communicate with individuals from different parts of the world. Secondly, it can help improve cognitive abilities as individuals who speak multiple languages have been found to perform better in tasks such as problem-solving, creativity, and multitasking. Finally, it can open up new career opportunities and make individuals more marketable in today's job market.</p><p></p><p>Learning a foreign language can help individuals communicate and connect with people from different cultures. As travel becomes more accessible, individuals are finding themselves needing to speak foreign languages to communicate with hotel staff, tour guides, and local residents. For example, individuals who speak Chinese Mandarin can easily interact with individuals living in China, as well as Chinese-speaking individuals in other countries. This can lead to a better and more positive experience for both parties, which can foster deeper connections and stronger relationships.</p><p></p><p>Studies have also shown that individuals who speak multiple languages display better cognitive abilities compared to those who speak only one language. Bilingual individuals have been found to perform better in tasks that require problem-solving and creative thinking. This is because of the cognitive benefits of learning a foreign language. Learning a new language requires individuals to develop better memory, concentration, and multitasking skills, which can help them become more effective in other areas of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Learning a foreign language provides individuals with new career opportunities, making them more marketable in today's job market. With globalization, many multinational companies require their employees to speak at least two languages to communicate with clients, suppliers, and shareholders. This means that individuals who speak a foreign language have a better chance of obtaining a higher salary, job promotions, and new job opportunities. Additionally, learning a foreign language can help individuals interact and network with people from different regions and cultures, further expanding their employment opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, learning a foreign language is essential in today's globalized world. It provides individuals with the ability to communicate with people from different parts of the world, improves cognitive abilities, and increases career opportunities. With statistics and studies supporting the benefits of learning a foreign language, it's clear that individuals should make every effort to learn a second language.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) answer. </p><p>As a student, I believe that homework is essential to promoting learning, and I do not support the idea of reducing or eliminating it. While I understand the concerns of some parents who feel that their children are being overloaded with homework, I believe that homework has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As a student, I believe that homework is essential to promoting learning, and I do not support the idea of reducing or eliminating it. While I understand the concerns of some parents who feel that their children are being overloaded with homework, I believe that homework has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework promotes independent learning and time management skills. When students are given homework, they are required to complete it on their own, without the immediate support of a teacher. This allows them to develop their own learning strategies and work at their own pace, which is a valuable skill that they will need in higher education and beyond. Furthermore, homework helps students to develop time management skills, as they must learn to balance the demands of school work with other activities and responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework provides an opportunity for students to practice and reinforce what they have learned in class. In subjects like mathematics, science, and foreign languages, students need to practice regularly to master the concepts and skills. Homework assignments allow students to apply what they have learned in class to real-world situations, which helps to reinforce the learning and deepen their understanding of the subject matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, homework provides teachers with a means of assessing student learning and progress. By assigning homework, teachers can evaluate the level of understanding and mastery of the subject matter, and adjust their instruction accordingly. Homework also provides a basis for feedback and evaluation, which is essential for improving student performance.</p><p></p><br />

What are the top examples of globalization? What famous quotes have been said about globalization?</p><p></p><p>What is Globalization? All Definitions of Globalization</p><p>A Simple Globalization Definition</p><p>Globalization means the speedup of movements and exchanges (of human beings, goods, and services, capital, technologies or cultural practices) all over the planet. One of the effects of globalization is that it promotes and increases interactions between different regions and populations around the globe.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are those who are not privileged enough to afford to go to different countries. Globalization exists to connect us to everyone worldwide and technology has also played a part in digitalizing it. We acquire new information every day by news or from books. Understanding the culture of everyone implies respecting what they do, act, and eat. In case, we meet individuals who have different cultures online, we are knowledgeable enough on what to say appropriately and how to act mannerly. </p><p></p><br />
