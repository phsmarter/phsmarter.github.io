Student life is the daily life of a student, typically involving social activities within the educational campus, or the time spent with school-mates and teachers. Student life is the happiest and the most crucial period in the life of a person. As a learner, I play a crucial and active role in education. I involve and interact with students and teachers, participate in classroom discussions, and act in a receptive manner. </p><br />

                            3. life of an student during online class essay, 3 paragraph​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In today's society, online courses are widely used in colleges providing easy access to course materials, classroom discussions, and feedback to instructors. The course materials and activities may be accessed from any computer, whether it is from the University or from the comfort of your own home. I've taken two online courses since I've been in college and have benefited from those classes. There are a few reasons to why I'm drawn to an online education course as opposed to taking courses in a traditional classroom setting. First of all, I have a full-time job, which limits my opportunities to attend classes scheduled during normal school hours. Also online classes allow me to work on my own and move at my own pace. Finally, these classes offer more of a one-on-one teacher-student relationship rather than a teacher having to spread their focus amongst thirty other students.</p><p></p><p>Having a full time job makes it very difficult to schedule your classes. The hours I have scheduled at my job conflict with the times that most classes are offered. The use of online courses has made life at work easier, since my manager refuses to work around school schedules. Since I don't have to meet on a regularly basis, I don't have to leave my job to meet on campus. It is very convenient for me not having to meet on a regular basis. When a person has to work full time, it is hard for that person to successfully juggle their job responsibilities along with homework and study. A person can always take an online course to deal with the time constraints that a job will put on you. The use of online courses allows you to cover the material needed in school while maintaining your workload.</p><p></p><p>I've learned that to be a successful distance learner, you have to be self-disciplined and able to work well on your own. Since you won't be physically going to class each week, you can take part in class from the comfort of your own home. You must be self-disciplined because the instructor won�t constantly be there to remind you of assignments or of project deadlines. Other obligations may mean that you are not able to do the work as regularly as if you were physically attending class, it will be up to you to make sure that you are keeping up with all the work for the course. Also, one of the main objectives of college is to become a well-rounded individual, with the skills needed to successfully manage a busy agenda.</p><p></p><p>The first online course I took, I just thought that the work for the course could be put off until I had time to do the work. In doing this, I got very far behind. It took me awhile to catch back up with the assignments and I promised myself that I would never let that happen again. The students who procrastinate about their assignments, usually either wind up withdrawing from the course late in the semester because they have fallen far behind or receiving an "F" in the course because they have not completed the required class-work by the time the course is over. A student should leave time in their schedule in order to complete the online courses successfully. Although online classes are more convenient, than traditional college classes, they should be looked at as typical college classes and not taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>Being able to communicate with instructors and other students, that are taking these courses, has made me be a more active participant during the courses. With the two online courses I�ve taken, I have never felt it difficult to communicate with my instructor to ask for help or clarification of an assignment. All of these instructors and the students taking these classes have been very helpful to me. The online courses offer a discussion board to send posts to your fellow students. You get a chance to read and critique each other�s work and respond to the comments of your classmates. I�ve learned that by discussing each other�s ideas we are in turn challenging each other to examine our own thoughts and feelings. This makes class work more interesting as we get a chance to share personal experiences in the discussion while improving on our writing style.</p><p></p><p>Any student that is interested in taking an online course should do research on the class and speak with the instructor before enrolling. Personally, I would recommend online courses to anyone that has a busy schedule, such as having a full time job or having family responsibilities. Also, you are able to learn well by doing the required work on your own, without depending solely on interaction with other students as a means of learning. Online courses are a great alternative to the student who must hold a full-time job while enrolled in college. Online courses are not only convenient but they teach you how to become a more disciplined scholar.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#PLEASE MARK ME AS BRAINLY<br />

                            4. How can academic text affect your life as a student?less than 3 paragraph -.-​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Academic writing is an important part of our lives, as it aids us in a variety of ways, from obtaining good grades to expanding our knowledge. It is regarded as one of the most important aspects of studies that has a huge impact on our lives, particularly throughout the academic stage. Despite the fact that the majority of students dislike the practice of writing academic assignments, they do so for the sake of grades and do not learn anything in the process. As a result, students must be aware of both the positive and negative sides of academic assignment writing for their own benefit.</p><p></p><p>One of the most beneficial habits for academic performance is writing. If you write down your thoughts on a daily basis, you will be able to better channel your thoughts. Thousands of thoughts pass through our heads every day, but we don't take the time to write them down. It's a time-consuming process to write down each and every thought, and it can't be done every time. However, in our fast-paced lives, we fail to notice that some thoughts are worth noting and can be beneficial to us in the long term. Our minds will not be swamped with other lingering notions if we continue to write down these thoughts.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Members of Advanced Field Study, a select group of Social Ecology students who are chosen from a pool of applicants to participate in a year-long field study experience and course, had their internships and traditional college experience cut short this year. During our final quarter of the year together, during which we met weekly for two hours via Zoom, we discussed their reactions as the world fell apart around them. First came the pandemic and social distancing, then came the death of George Floyd and the response of the Black Lives Matter movement, both of which were imprinted on the lives of these students. This year was anything but dull, instead full of raw emotion and painful realizations of the fragility of the human condition and the extent to which we need one another. This seemed like the perfect opportunity for our students to chronicle their experiences — the good and the bad, the lessons learned, and ways in which they were forever changed by the events of the past four months. I invited all of my students to write an essay describing the ways in which these times had impacted their learning and their lives during or after their time at UCI. These are their voices. — Jessica Borelli, associate professor of psychological science</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#hope its help</p><p>#carry on learning</p><br />

                        <p></p><p> </p><p> COVID-19 pandemic has introduced uncertainty into major aspects of national and global society, including for schools. For example, there is uncertainty about how school closures last spring impacted student achievement, as well as how the rapid conversion of most instruction to an online platform this academic year will continue to affect achievement. Without data on how the virus impacts student learning, making informed decisions about whether and when to return to in-person instruction remains difficult. Even now, education leaders must grapple with seemingly impossible choices that balance health risks associated with in-person learning against the educational needs of children, which may be better served when kids are in their physical schools.</p><p></p><p>Amidst all this uncertainty, there is growing consensus that school closures in spring 2020 likely had negative effects on student learning. For example, in an earlier post for this blog, we presented our research forecasting the possible impact of school closures on achievement. Based on historical learning trends and prior research on how out-of-school-time affects learning, we estimated that students would potentially begin fall 2020 with roughly 70% of the learning gains in reading relative to a typical school year. In mathematics, students were predicted to show even smaller learning gains from the previous year, returning with less than 50% of typical gains. While these and other similar forecasts presented a grim portrait of the challenges facing students and educators this fall, they were nonetheless projections. The question remained: What would learning trends in actual data from the 2020-21 school year really look like?</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The use of social media has had a profound effect on the lives of students. On one hand, it has allowed them to connect with people from all over the world and share ideas and experiences. It has also enabled them to stay up-to-date with current events, find new job opportunities, and even access educational resources. On the other hand, it can be a major distraction from studying and can lead to cyberbullying or other negative behaviors. Social media can also lead to feelings of isolation or depression if used too much or in an unhealthy way. Therefore, it is important for students to use social media responsibly in order to maximize its positive effects while minimizing its potential harms.</p><br />

                        <p>Those who are not worried about the financial aspect or the thought never crossed their minds have privilege. Merriam Webster defines privilege as “a right or immunity granted as a peculiar benefit, advantage, or favor.” Privilege can have a negative connotation. What you choose to do with your privilege is what matters. Talking about privilege can bring discomfort, but the discomfort it brings can also carry the benefit of drawing awareness to one’s privilege, which can lead the person to take steps to help others. My parents help pay for school expenses, including housing, tuition, and food. I do not have to worry about paying rent or how to pay for food because my parents are financially stable to help me. However, there are millions of college students who are not financially stable or do not have the support system I have. Here, I have the privilege and, thus, I am the one who can offer help to others. I may not have millions in funding, but volunteering for centers who need help is where I am able to help. I was not aware of my privilege during these times until I started reading more articles about how millions of people cannot afford to pay their rent, and landlords are starting to send notices of violations. Rather than feel guilty and be passive about it, I chose to put my privilege into a sense of purpose: Donating to nonprofits helping those affected by COVID-19, continuing to support local businesses, and supporting businesses who are donating profits to those affected by COVID-19.</p><p></p><p><strong>A </strong><strong>simple </strong><strong>'Thank </strong><strong>you' </strong><strong>will </strong><strong>do.</strong></p><br />

                            26. 2 descriptive paragraph about your life as a student in this new normal learning​</h2><br />
                        <p>Adapting to a New Normal During COVID-19</p><p>Keri CloptonKerri Clopton, Nicole Skaar and Stephanie Schmitz are College of Education associate professors who specialize in school psychology. They drew on their expertise to share advice for parents and others who are navigating this new world of COVID-19. </p><p></p><p>Adapting to the new normal associated with COVID-19 was difficult and then the new normal changed….and changed again. The new normal is continuing to change and there is no clear timeline for when we can expect our lives to return to the “old normal” many of us long for. </p><p></p><p>Stephanie SchmitzFor many students and their caregivers (e.g., parents, family members, guardians), the newest normal includes “continuous learning” opportunities provided by their school district that may be voluntary or required. As a caregiver, you have now added teacher and/or “classroom manager” to your list of daily responsibilities. We imagine there have been a wide range of responses to the new responsibilities and we believe handling these new responsibilities with grace and flexibility will be critical for the well-being of caregivers and their children.</p><p></p><p>Nicole SkaarCaregivers are dealing with a range of demands and stressors as the new normal continues to change. Stress associated with safety and health issues, financial issues and juggling working from home with caregiving demands is likely common. Children’s academic, emotional and behavioral needs also vary, with some children requiring substantial support in their typical school environment. Children also vary in their levels of interest in and motivation for school and school work. Given the range of needs, stressors and demands, we make the following recommendations as caregivers and children continue their learning:</p><p></p><p>Give grace to yourself and others. These are difficult circumstances for everyone. It is important to remember that what you may see on other people’s social media pertaining to  “amazing continuing learning opportunities” is probably not representative of what is occurring in most homes, and may not be possible for your home.</p><p>Keep routines if you can. Children thrive with routine. It can provide a sense of comfort and predictability in a time when we are unsure of what comes next. </p><p>Communicate with your kids (clearly and at a developmentally appropriate level) about your expectations for behavior and engagement in academic activities. Seek their input about what is and is not working. They may be able to tell you what tasks they can do independently and what tasks require your support. Also talk about how much time you can spend with them each day and work time with them into the routine for the day. This may help you get your work done without interruption, while also giving kids some assurance that the connection they need with you is coming. Set realistic goals and allow yourself to abandon them as needed. There are likely going to be good, bad and ugly days. Celebrate the good days and allow yourself to change the day’s plan when needed.</p><p>Communicate with your child’s teacher if you and your child are struggling with required work or don’t have the resources you need to complete assigned tasks. </p><p>Create time for student-led activities. This is a great time for kids to learn to cook or bake, to learn about their favorite singer or athlete, or to learn a new instrument using YouTube videos. Ask your kids what they want to spend time learning and make time for this student-led learning. Relatedly, offer kids choices when it comes to the schedule for the day. When do they want to do academic activities? What academic activities do they want to do first? Have your student(s) work with you to create a schedule for the day.</p><p>Take care of your relationship with your child. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As this challenging academic term begins, and some students are learning remotely, while others are heading back in person, we urge educators to pause and reflect on what worked — and didn’t — during remote learning last spring. While we eagerly await the moment when all schools can safely resume in person, we strongly caution against reverting back to the “normal” way of doing things. “Normal” was not working for so many students prior to COVID-19.</p><br />

                            28. Make a paragraph explanation about "students life" (Thankyou in advance!)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Student life is a time of growth and development, both academically and personally. It is a time when students are immersed in a diverse and dynamic community, where they are exposed to different ideas, perspectives, and experiences. The typical student life includes attending classes, studying for exams, participating in extracurricular activities, making new friends, and exploring new interests. Balancing academic work with social and personal commitments can be challenging, but it is also an opportunity for students to learn important life skills such as time management, responsibility, and prioritization. As students progress through their academic journey, they gain knowledge, skills, and experiences that prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the future. Student life is a unique and exciting time that shapes the trajectory of students' lives, and provides them with a strong foundation for success in their chosen paths</p>Student life refers to the experience and daily routine of individuals who are pursuing education at various levels, including primary, secondary, and tertiary education. It encompasses all aspects of student experience, including academics, social activities, personal development, and extracurricular activities. In addition to attending classes, students also engage in studying, group projects, research, and exams. The social aspect of student life includes interacting with peers, joining clubs or organizations, attending events, and participating in sports or recreational activities. Personal development is also an important aspect of student life, as students learn to manage their time, set goals, and develop critical thinking skills. Overall, student life can be challenging but also rewarding, as students gain knowledge and skills that will benefit them throughout their lives.<br />

                            30. Please give a 8-10 line paragraph about high school students life</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>High school students range in age from 14 to 18. With this wide range of ages comes a wide range of abilities. As you look at your class, you will notice that some students are able to focus for only half an hour and others for upwards of one and a half hours. Some are ready to move from the concrete to discussion of abstract ideas, while others are lost. These differences are related to many factors beyond merely age.</p><p></p><p>Many students are more focused on their personal relationships and on the here and now than on their education or future. Some students prefer to focus on the coolness of not participating in any activity or discussion rather than on actively engaging in their education. To some degree, this reflects both teenage culture and the culture at large.</p><br />
