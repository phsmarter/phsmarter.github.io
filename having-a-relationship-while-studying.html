                                            When people are interested in exploring a problem using a scientific approach, it is said that they are doing a 1. ________________. In relation to this, the person who is in control of the research is called the 2. ________________. On the other hand, the people who are being examined in the study are called 3. ________________. Another important notion in research that is defined as an abstract generalization that describes a systematic presentation about relationships among phenomena is called a 4. ________________. Aside from that, another factor that plays a significant purpose in research that is also known as the building blocks of theories are called 5. ________________. In general, the concepts that are studied and observed in a research are called 6. ________________. These may be classified into several types. The concept that is being studied that usually indicates the influence or cause is called the 7. ________________ variable while the onethat the researcher is most interested in understanding is called the 8. ________________variable. In addition to these two, variables that may influence or contaminate the data are called 9. ________________ variables. Eventually, a research will become successful if the researchers are concerned about the groups involved in their study. If the group that is being studied has members that are different from one another, it is said to be 10. ________________ while groups with members having similar qualities are called 11. ________________. When studying variables, definitions must be clarified. A variable such as anxiety may be defined as a feeling of uneasiness. This type of definition is also known as 12. __________________. To measure anxiety, the State - Traite Anxiety Scale might be used. This, in contrast, would be called the 13. ________________ definition. Furthermore, researchers have to keep in mind that there are two major categories for research designs. One design, the 14.________________ approach, uses data with numerical representation or values whereas the second design, 15. ________________, uses narrative data. pa help sa magaling dyan.. mas maganda ma perfect :)​</a>

                                            Implications and Conclusion what is your opinion or comments of this ?Although emerging segmentations offer improved richness of data, trade-offs include the increasing complexity in processes and the potential for loss of control. These developments may require marketers to develop new competencies. As marketing matures, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of approaches to segmentation. A single marketer active in CRM, direct marketing and strategic planning could potentially have access to four independently conducted segmentation studies, each using different methodologies and different variables, giving rise to practical and computational problems linking multiple segmentation studies. Databases of online transaction histories are likely to become a more important resource in segmentation and profiling. Arguably this will impact on external relationships as marketers reduce their dependence on market research firms while increasing their reliance on IT services and proprietary software systems. ​</a>

Use the graphic organizer as your guide in writing the report. (1-5) "Advantages and disadvantages of online games for children." Children spend a lot of their time playing games online. That is why most of the learnings used it as a tool in studying their lessons. It is easy for them to understand their lessons while playing it through online games. Through playing games, it is possible to stimulate connections and brain activity. However, spending too much time playing games online might be dangerous for children. For instance, some children may not do their homework, study, or play sports because they are addicted to play games and play those most of the time. Second, playing games that narrow their relationship. Children did not have much time to socialize with the outside and they were immersed in the game. Playing games is a virtual world, through which children will have some friends, but that number is not much, and it does not make up for friends and good relationships they have lost. Online games can be both useful and harmful to all children that is why guidance is necessary. Play the game intelligently and balanced it all the time.

                                            Last week we studied about describing and identifying triang' according to sides and angles as well as the different kinds c quadrilaterals. Polygons are also discussed as plane figures having sides a corners. Two of their kinds are triangles and quadrilaterals. Bo triangles and quadrilaterals are polygons. A triangle has three sic while a quadrilateral has four. This week, we are going to study the relationship of triangles quadrilaterals and discover how one quadrilateral relates to anoth quadrilateral. In this lesson you are expected to: ● Relate triangles to quadrilaterals. and Relate one quadrilateral to another quadrilateral (ex. square to rhombus) Let's read this: Relating Triangles to Quadrilaterals A triangle is half of a quadrilateral The sum of the angles of quadrilateral is always 360°, whereas the sum of the angles a triangle is always 180° 30 60 900 DOP 30% Shown above is an illustration on how we can relate a triangle to quadrilateral. Here, the sum of the measures of the angles of each trian has a total of 180 degrees and since a quadrilateral contains two triang therefore, the sum of the measures of its angles equals 360 degrees. Area Area of a Quadrilateral A=x Area of a Triangl A =6xJ€ Another illustration above shows the relationship of triangles c quadrilaterals where their formulas clearly relate. The formula in getting area of a quadrilateral is A=B x H while a triangle is A=(B x H)/2, which she that in every quadrilateral there are two triangles. There are many different types of quadrilaterals and they all share the similarity of having four sides, two diagonals and the sum of their interio: angles is 360 degrees. They all have relationships to one another, but they are not all exactly alike and have different properties. Answer this pls I need it​</a>

                        Tricky question. <br /><br /> Sa tingin / opinion ko "balance" lang dapat sa relationship at sa studies. Di naman kasi pwedeng more on studies ka, kasi may tendency na mawalhan ka ng oras sa partner mo. At sa relationship, di dapat nakatuon yung oras mo sa partner mo kasi nandun yung point na mapapabayaan mo yung pag-aaral mo tas yung relationship na meron ka ii yun na yung magiging sanhi kung bakit ka nag didistract sa pag aaral mo. <br /><br />I hope naka tulong ako :)<br />

                            10. When people are interested in exploring a problem using a scientific approach, it is said that they are doing a 1. ________________. In relation to this, the person who is in control of the research is called the 2. ________________. On the other hand, the people who are being examined in the study are called 3. ________________. Another important notion in research that is defined as an abstract generalization that describes a systematic presentation about relationships among phenomena is called a 4. ________________. Aside from that, another factor that plays a significant purpose in research that is also known as the building blocks of theories are called 5. ________________. In general, the concepts that are studied and observed in a research are called 6. ________________. These may be classified into several types. The concept that is being studied that usually indicates the influence or cause is called the 7. ________________ variable while the onethat the researcher is most interested in understanding is called the 8. ________________variable. In addition to these two, variables that may influence or contaminate the data are called 9. ________________ variables. Eventually, a research will become successful if the researchers are concerned about the groups involved in their study. If the group that is being studied has members that are different from one another, it is said to be 10. ________________ while groups with members having similar qualities are called 11. ________________. When studying variables, definitions must be clarified. A variable such as anxiety may be defined as a feeling of uneasiness. This type of definition is also known as 12. __________________. To measure anxiety, the State - Traite Anxiety Scale might be used. This, in contrast, would be called the 13. ________________ definition. Furthermore, researchers have to keep in mind that there are two major categories for research designs. One design, the 14.________________ approach, uses data with numerical representation or values whereas the second design, 15. ________________, uses narrative data. pa help sa magaling dyan.. mas maganda ma perfect :)​</h2><br />

                            11. Implications and Conclusion what is your opinion or comments of this ?Although emerging segmentations offer improved richness of data, trade-offs include the increasing complexity in processes and the potential for loss of control. These developments may require marketers to develop new competencies. As marketing matures, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of approaches to segmentation. A single marketer active in CRM, direct marketing and strategic planning could potentially have access to four independently conducted segmentation studies, each using different methodologies and different variables, giving rise to practical and computational problems linking multiple segmentation studies.

                            12. Make an ad argumentative essay about this issue/topic:"Boy and Girl having a relationship while studying".​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In today's society, relationships between boys and girls while studying are becoming more common. While some may argue that these relationships are a distraction from academic goals, I believe that they can actually enhance a student's academic experience and personal growth.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, relationships can provide emotional support and motivation for students to excel in their studies. When a student is in a healthy relationship, they have someone to confide in, bounce ideas off of, and provide encouragement during difficult times. This emotional support can lead to increased motivation to achieve academic goals and improve overall academic performance.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, relationships can teach important life skills such as communication, compromise, and time management. These skills are essential for success both in academics and in personal relationships. Learning to effectively communicate and compromise with a partner can lead to more successful academic collaborations and group projects, while also improving personal relationships.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, relationships can expose students to new perspectives and ideas. In a relationship, two people come from different backgrounds and experiences, which can lead to the exchange of new ideas and ways of thinking. This exposure to different perspectives can enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are important in both academic and personal contexts.</p><p></p><p>However, it is important to note that relationships should not interfere with academic responsibilities. Students should prioritize their studies and make sure that their relationships do not become a distraction. It is also important for students to maintain healthy boundaries and ensure that the relationship is not toxic or detrimental to their mental and emotional well-being.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, relationships between boys and girls while studying can provide emotional support, teach important life skills, and expose students to new perspectives and ideas. While it is important to prioritize academic responsibilities and maintain healthy boundaries, these relationships can enhance a student's academic experience and personal growth.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />

                            21. Last week we studied about describing and identifying triang' according to sides and angles as well as the different kinds c quadrilaterals. Polygons are also discussed as plane figures having sides a corners. Two of their kinds are triangles and quadrilaterals. Bo triangles and quadrilaterals are polygons. A triangle has three sic while a quadrilateral has four. This week, we are going to study the relationship of triangles quadrilaterals and discover how one quadrilateral relates to anoth quadrilateral. In this lesson you are expected to: ● Relate triangles to quadrilaterals. and Relate one quadrilateral to another quadrilateral (ex. square to rhombus) Let's read this: Relating Triangles to Quadrilaterals A triangle is half of a quadrilateral The sum of the angles of quadrilateral is always 360°, whereas the sum of the angles a triangle is always 180° 30 60 900 DOP 30% Shown above is an illustration on how we can relate a triangle to quadrilateral. Here, the sum of the measures of the angles of each trian has a total of 180 degrees and since a quadrilateral contains two triang therefore, the sum of the measures of its angles equals 360 degrees. Area Area of a Quadrilateral A=x Area of a Triangl A =6xJ€ Another illustration above shows the relationship of triangles c quadrilaterals where their formulas clearly relate. The formula in getting area of a quadrilateral is A=B x H while a triangle is A=(B x H)/2, which she that in every quadrilateral there are two triangles. There are many different types of quadrilaterals and they all share the similarity of having four sides, two diagonals and the sum of their interio: angles is 360 degrees. They all have relationships to one another, but they are not all exactly alike and have different properties. Answer this pls I need it​</h2><br />

                            27. Make an argumentative essay about this issue/topic: 500-700 words"Boy-girl having a relationship while studying"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In today's society, it is not uncommon for boys and girls to form relationships while studying. However, this issue has been the subject of much debate, with some people arguing that it can be a distraction from academics, while others believe that it can enhance a student's experience in school. In this essay, I will present both sides of the argument and provide my opinion on the matter.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, there are those who argue that having a relationship while studying can be a significant distraction from academics. They believe that students who are involved in romantic relationships tend to prioritize their significant others over their studies, leading to a decline in their grades. Additionally, students who are in relationships may spend more time socializing with their partners rather than studying, which can also have a negative impact on their academic performance. Furthermore, breakups can be emotionally draining and affect students' mental health, leading to even more significant distractions from their studies.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there are those who argue that being in a relationship while studying can have a positive impact on a student's experience. They believe that relationships can provide emotional support and encouragement, which can help students overcome academic challenges. Moreover, being in a relationship can promote a sense of belonging and connection, which can lead to improved overall well-being and happiness. Additionally, being in a relationship can provide opportunities for students to learn important skills such as communication, compromise, and problem-solving, which can be valuable in both their personal and professional lives.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I believe that having a relationship while studying can be a positive experience as long as students can balance their academics and their romantic relationships. While it is true that being in a relationship can be a significant distraction, it is also true that students can find emotional support and motivation from their partners. As with any activity or commitment, it is important for students to learn how to manage their time effectively and prioritize their responsibilities.
