I grew up in a caring and nurturing home where I always felt safe and cherished from a young age. My parents always treated me as if I mattered. Throughout my life, I've been a tenacious young man, If things didn't go my way, I used to throw a tantrum. Despite the fact that my mother loved me unconditionally, I was a very demanding child. My mother was always understanding and patient with me, and she used to explain things to me in such a manner that I could understand why things didn't always work out the way I wanted them to. I never wanted to understand her preachings as a child, though. However, a trip to an orphanage on a school trip completely transformed my perspective on life.</p><p></p><p>The place where orphans (children who are homeless and have no parents) are cared for is known as an orphanage. Our school once arranged an educational trip to an orphanage institute when I was in fourth grade. We were instructed to bring whatever we wished to donate. My mum gave me some old toys, clothes, and sweets as a gift. We were able to gather a large amount of information for distribution.</p><p></p><p>All of the children gathered in a hall as we entered the institution. Children of all ages were present. They looked up at us with a hopeful look in their eyes. We were given the task of dispersing the items and spent some time with them. They were ecstatic when they received these old items. We learned from our conversations with them that they only have two or three dresses to choose from. For their food, they'll have a plate and a bowl. The food that was supplied to them was always the same and restricted in quantity. There aren't many meal options for them to choose from. They have the same set of toys to play with. These children have no idea what it is to be loved, cared for, or adored. They have no right to demand anything. I realized all of my mistakes after seeing how horrible every child's situation was. I realized how fortunate I am to be able to enjoy all of the luxuries.</p><p></p><p>When my parents criticized me for not studying correctly, making mistakes, or not listening to them, I didn't enjoy it because they were concerned about every word they uttered. They were there for me at every stage of my life, no matter how ill they were. But I felt so sorry for these children because they don't have the words to express their concern, rage, or affection. For me, going to the orphanage is a life-changing experience. I started to appreciate the little things in life from that day on. I've never been one to demand unexpected things. I feel compelled to assist everyone who is in need. As time went on, I began to grasp my mother's preachings, and, with her aid, I learned how to deal with my own emotions and situations, which formed my conduct and personality in the process. I consider myself exceedingly blessed to have parents who take care of me in every way possible. It is for this reason that I am really grateful.</p><p></p><p>===Ani===</p><p></p>#HopeItHelps^-^<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Why is Life Important?</strong></p><p><strong>One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one’s death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.</strong></p><p></p><br />

Why do you think so? 2. Can you share your personal experiences or observations about this issue? 3.How does poverty affect you, your family, and the community in general? 4.in your opinion, how can poverty be lessened?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Poverty is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects individuals, families, and communities. It is a socio-economic problem that belongs to the larger issue of social inequality. Poverty is often linked to various issues such as unemployment, lack of education, and inadequate access to basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare. It is a systemic issue that affects millions of people around the world, and it requires a comprehensive and sustained effort to address it.</p><p></p><p>2. Growing up in a developing country, I have seen firsthand how poverty can impact families. I have seen families struggle to put food on the table, send their children to school, and provide basic healthcare. Many families are forced to live in cramped and unhygienic conditions, which leads to health issues. Children in poverty are also at risk of malnutrition, which can have long-term effects on their physical and mental health. Poverty can cause immense stress on families, leading to mental health issues and relationship breakdowns.</p><p></p><p>3. Poverty has a significant impact not only on individuals and families but also on the community in general. It can lead to social exclusion, crime, and violence. Poverty creates a vicious cycle, making it difficult for individuals and families to break free from its grip. To lessen poverty, we need a multi-faceted approach that addresses the root causes of poverty. This approach should include measures such as improving access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. We also need to provide social safety nets and support for those who are most vulnerable, including children, the elderly, and those with disabilities. Addressing poverty requires a collaborative effort between governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals to create sustainable solutions that can lead to positive change in society.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>FUN FACT ABOUT PANGEA AND PANGEAULTIMA</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pangaea was the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists. The distribution of fossils across the continents is one line of evidence pointing to the existence of Pangaea.Pangaea Proxima (also called Pangaea Ultima, Neopangaea, and Pangaea II) is a possible future supercontinent configuration. Consistent with the supercontinent cycle, Pangaea Proxima could occur within the next 200 million years.Pangea Ultima is projected as the next supercontinent 250 million years. If you incorporate the velocities and trajectories of current plate movement, then you can model how continents will evolve. The landmass itself would extend 13,000 miles with one superocean covering two-thirds of Earth.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p></p><p>Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights, focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems. Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.[3] Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have the obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights.[4] Human rights cannot be separated from the societal contexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, which include the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancing their ability to participate as active members of society.[5] Such an understanding of social rights calls our attention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the “collective.”[6] Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rights is not optional.[7] In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respect and protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic and social rights for all.</p><br />

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?
