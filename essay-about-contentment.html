                        Contentment is the state of being satisfied with one's lot. The contented man is pleased with what he has. He does not make himself miserable by envying those who have what he has not. Such contentment breeds happiness. It is, therefore, worth cultivating; and this can be done.Discontent is an ugly thing. It brings nothing but unhappiness. A discontented man is unhappy himself, and his constant grumbling and bad temper make all round him unhappy too. He is always comparing his lot with the lot of those better off than himself. His envy of them makes him bitter. He hates others for their greater success and prosper­ity. He is a miserable wretch. So we must value every thing we have and be grateful because compare to the other people, we are very lucky<br />

The novella was published six days in advance of the Christmas celebrations of 1843; it was sold out three days later. Although a socially engaged narrative, Dickens’ work is not occupied with trivialities such as the introduction of Christmas cards; instead A Christmas Carol focuses on the transforming beliefs and values within society and endeavours to contribute to these changes. A hundred and forty years later, the story was (once again) retold: The Disney film…show more content…</p><p>In line with this change, Dickens’ contemporary George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) marked “the ideal of goodness entirely human” (Jenkins 143). In The Scriptures of Charles Dickens, Vincent Newey states that A Christmas Carol shows its readers a world in which the religious motive for celebrating Christmas has started to attenuate and a humanist motive to augment; evidence for this assumption is found in the first stave of the novella in the speech of Scrooge’s nephew: </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po to help others narin</p><p></p><br />

                        <p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>Heal the world, make it a better place,” is the tagline of the famous song Heal the World, by pop legend Michael Jackson. (Jackson) Jackson was always concerned about bettering the lives of children, which inspired him to write this song. It brought a lot of awareness to issues faced by people daily all throughout the world. Heal the World was not onlya song that people enjoyed listening to, but one that had an impact on our lives, and showed that bettering the lives of children and people was necessary worldwide. As you learn more about this song in your reading, you will hear a personal explanation and opinion of the story Jackson is telling, and as a result what our society has accomplished in trying to correct the problems people face daily. You will also hear the opinion of how these issues should be handled by the government and key figures in society. Heal the World allowed Jackson to show people that loving one another and helping each other is vital in life.Heal the World was written, produced, and sung by Michael Jackson himself. He wrote and recorded the song in 1991, in the branches of his “Giving Tree” at his Neverland Ranch. Epic Records was where Jackson recorded the song, which was released the same year on his hit album Dangerous, on November 26. (“All Music”) The music video features children from othercountries suffering from unrest. However, their circumstances are improved throughout certain sections of the video when the scene correlates with positive aspects of the lyrics. It is also one of the few videos that did not feature Jackson himself. (Official Music Video) The Heal the World Foundation was created by Jackson in 1992, mainly due to the inspiration of his song. It was a charitable organization that gave back to people, children, and countries that were living in</p><p></p><p>Image of page 2</p><p></p><p>Bowman 3poverty. The purpose of the charity was to provide medicine to children, fight world hunger, homelessness, child exploitation and abuse. Jackson stated that he wanted "to improve the conditions for children throughout the world". (Pabst) This foundation showed Jackson’s compassion about people all over the world, and his restless atempts to make people’s lives better.Heal the World is a very touching song that motivates people to want to make a difference in the world. As the song is repeatedly played, the message of the song can easily be interpreted. The first two verses of the song are telling individuals to make a place in their heart to give back and help those in need.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student, I firmly believe that anti-bullying and anti-hazing campaigns are essential in creating a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. These campaigns aim to address issues that often go unnoticed but can have long-lasting impacts on individuals and communities. Through these campaigns, we learn about the negative effects of bullying and hazing, and how we can prevent and intervene in these situations. Additionally, we also learn about the importance of acceptance and respect for diversity. </p><p></p><p>As a reflection, I think that these campaigns have been effective in creating awareness and addressing these issues. However, more needs to be done to ensure that students feel safe and included in their school communities. It is important for schools to have clear policies and procedures in place for dealing with bullying and hazing, as well as providing support for victims and bystanders. </p><p></p><p>In terms of mechanics, I tried my best to make sure that my essay is free from any grammatical or spelling errors. I also made sure to follow proper sentence structure and use appropriate vocabulary.

From this statistic, we can see that classical music is losing its popularity amongst people living in the 21st century. This may be due to the fact that Western Classical Music is stereotypically seen to uninteresting due to the lack excitement in their concerts.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, teen pregnancy is becoming more and more common throughout the world. So many people frown upon this whole idea. Such people act as if the teenage parents’ world is going to come to an end. Although these kids’ life is going to be making a big turn, there are many of them who are mature enough to take on the responsibilities of a baby. As the medical field advances, the ways to avoid teen pregnancy goes up as well. There are ways such as abortion, plan B pills, and birth control. Some people use this because they know they are not ready to become parents, which I feel is a good and responsible choice. On the other hand, those who use these methods as a way to technically “kill” the unborn is what should be frowned upon instead.</p><p>I was on birth control to try to avoid pregnancy only because I knew that I was one of those people who wasn’t ready to have a baby. I was still a kid myself, living a teenage life in my parents’ home without a job. The pills were a bad choice for me because I forgot to take them at least once a week. This lack of responsibility on my part led me to getting pregnant and having to change my life completely. It took a few weeks to adapt and to except my predicament, but as soon as I did, I had a different perspective on teen pregnancy. I felt at that moment that my situation wasn’t as bad as I originally thought. It was hard to tell people knowing that everyone would possibly think of me in a different way, the way I used to think of people that were in the same position. I refused to hide it, due to the fact that I felt nothing was wrong with being pregnant as a teenager. I had to do what was best and make a plan to make everything.</p><p>This is known to be the best time of your life. Girls who are faced with teen pregnancy go through dramatic changes. They have to make adjustments in their life and limit the partying and most of the physical activities. Along with those changes, pregnant teens need to focus on getting an education in order to get a job that will support themselves and their child. No one’s life is easy, especially going through a drastic change like this. Even though it gets rough at times it can still be manageable and that is what a lot of people don’t realize. From my personal experience, I feel that anyone can get through it. Not only am I a parent as a teenager, but I am also juggling my college classes and a full time job. It’s hard to accept that I will miss a lot of my baby’s first time experiences, however, I have to focus on what’s best for my child and myself.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pabrainliest </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>FIGHT NOT FRIGHT</strong></p><p>     Writing has always been a part of my life, it is my pastime, way of self-reflection, and best friend that knows the thoughts and ideas I have kept to myself. If I am going through a lot pain, I can make several masterpieces. The masterpiece I made boosts my confidence to try the opportunities around me.</p><p>     One time on July 2021, there was a National Disaster Resilience Month Regional Essay Competition and I was hesitant to join because I am having frequent emotional breakdown that time. In the end, I was won over my emotions and decided not to join the competition which left me a lot of regrets. If I have joined the competition, I have a chance to win. If I have fought the negative thoughts in my mind, I would have written my best piece for the contest. If I only have tried, it would not haunt me until now.</p><p>     Opportunities are easier to catch if it is right in front of us but it is harder to chase once it has passed by. If only regret comes first, it will hurt me less.</p><br />

                        <p>Hello there, Khirk!  I apologize, we cannot do that here.  We can only give you some tips on how to make a scientific essay.</p><p></p><p>Commonly, an essay is composed of three paragraphs which are the introduction, body, and the conclusion.  However, in your case, you were given a task to have a 5-paragraph essay; hence, the 3 major parts are excluded.</p><p></p><p>In a paragraph, usually, has 3-7 sentences; depending on the likes of the instructor or the likes of yours—because we have what we call writing style, originality is.  Additionally, an outline technique is important in making a good essay, because this is when you brainstorm all the necessary information.</p><p></p><p>To make a scientific paragraph, normally, you must have a opening statement, main idea, supporting details, and examples.</p><p></p><p>The "opening statement" (or known as the thesis statement) is a statement where your essay is all about.  For example, "The Global Warming on Earth."  It must be a general thought or a broad topic that must be elaborated.  More likely a title, but...nah.</p><p></p><p>The "main idea" is the supporting idea on the opening statement.  This is where the outline technique will begin.  You will specify the information related to your statement.  For example, "Global warming deflates the ozone layer on Earth."  In this part, you have started a good topic about global warming, and that relates to the ozone layer deflation.  You can have several main idea as long as it does not affect the required number of essay.</p><p></p><p>The "supporting details" are the back-ups of your main idea.  This is where a more specific explanation shall be given.  For example, "As the ozone layer decreases, climate change will be affected and Earth's temperature might rise unimaginably."  More supporting details, much better.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the "Examples."  These are the back-up of the supporting details; but, not actually backing-up, they are just an idea that made creatively; to be understood very clearly.  Although, I think, having an example is not really important, because I could not give examples on my example supporting detail.</p><p></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Opening statement &lt;-- Main idea &lt;-- Supporting details &lt;-- Examples</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since it is a scientific essay, a specific (or straight-to-the-point) information is needed; no more story telling happen.  Statistical information (numerical) and informative sentences are the types to be considered.</p><p></p><p>I guess those are all?  I hope these help.  I am really sorry, I cannot give you the specific answers about these.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: I have indicated one example as your main idea; however, it is just an idea, you must revise it.</p><br />
