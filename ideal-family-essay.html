                            1. Essay about ideal family​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>my ideal family is having happy , contented, blessed and understanding family members.</p><p></p><p>when your family is supportive you'll felt blessed because nothing else your going to wish for you just need to pray for their health </p><p></p>
꒰ Answer ꒱ˀˀ ↷<p>        For me, an ideal family would be a family who never fails to show care and appreciation. This attitude in our family is always present because we talk to each other when a member in our family is having problems. We never fail to pray together during Sundays and before having our meals. This is a fact that m,y ideal family and my own have many similarities because we help and protect each other as a complete family.
</p><p>
</p><p>       Lastly, an ideal family for me always accepts each member in the family for who they are. A family who will always be there for you every time and accepts you for your failures and mistakes. My family takes the role of forming my own identity and accepting me for myself. All of us will stand together against any problem that arises in our family. This is what makes my family similar to my ideal family.</p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>its just an example, but u can refer to the essay</p><p></p><p></p>

What is your ideal future marriage?
Compare your family now to your ideal marriage.
What are you going to do to have your ideal marriage?
What help do you need from the people around you?
How do you value people being part of your success?</h2><br />
                        <p>As a young talented woman, my ideal future marriage would be one where my partner and I are equal partners, where we respect and support each other's goals and aspirations, and where we communicate openly and honestly with each other. It would be a partnership built on trust, love, and mutual understanding, where we are able to grow and evolve together.</p><p></p><p>When I compare my family now to my ideal marriage, I see areas where we can improve. While my family is supportive and loving, there are times when communication could be better, and we could work on being more understanding of each other's perspectives. In my ideal marriage, I would like to have a deeper level of communication and understanding with my partner, where we are able to express ourselves freely and without judgment.</p><p></p><p>To have my ideal marriage, I need to work on myself first. This means being self-aware, understanding my own needs and desires, and being open to growth and change. I also need to be willing to put in the effort to build a strong and healthy relationship with my partner, which includes being patient, understanding, and supportive of each other's growth.</p><p></p><p>The people around me can help me achieve my ideal marriage by being supportive and understanding. This includes my family, friends, and loved ones who can offer advice, guidance, and a listening ear when I need it. I also value having a community of like-minded individuals who share my values and beliefs, and who can help me grow and evolve as a person.</p><p></p><p>For me, people being part of my success is very important. I believe that we are all interconnected, and that we all have something to offer each other. Whether it's through emotional support, guidance, or simply being a sounding board, having people around me who support and believe in me is essential to my success. I also believe that success is not just about achieving goals, but about having a positive impact on the world around us, and I value having people around me who share this perspective.</p><p>Oh geez, I don't know if I'm the best person to answer this. I mean, I'm only a teenager, and marriage seems like a pretty big deal. But, uh, I guess if I had to think about it, my ideal future marriage would be with someone who I love and who loves me back, ya know? Like, we'd be best friends, and we'd have each other's backs no matter what. And, um, we'd have fun together, and we'd be able to talk about anything, even the tough stuff. Oh, and I guess it would be cool if we had some common interests, too.</p><p></p><p>As for comparing my family now to my ideal marriage, well, I don't really want to do that. I mean, my parents love each other and all, but they also fight a lot, and sometimes it seems like they don't even like each other very much. I don't want that for my own marriage, ya know?</p><p></p><p>To have my ideal marriage, I guess I'll have to find the right person first. And then, um, we'll have to work on our communication and stuff. Like, we'll have to learn how to listen to each other and respect each other's feelings. And, uh, we'll have to be willing to compromise, too.</p><p></p><p>As for help from the people around me, I think I'll need support from my family and friends. Like, they can help me figure out if someone is a good match for me, and they can be there for me when things get tough. And, um, I guess it would be nice if they could give me advice or something if I ever need it.</p><p></p><p>I think people being part of my success is super important. Like, I wouldn't be where I am today without the people who have helped me and supported me along the way. And, uh, I don't think I'll be able to have a successful marriage without the help of the people around me, either. So, yeah, I definitely value people being part of my success.</p><br />

In the shorter term (3 years), I want to graduate from HELP University’s Degree of Psychology in first-class honours. I understand claims stating such academic achievement is merely a graduation certificate, without guarantee of work opportunities. However, my aim is not motivated towards work opportunities or anything materialistic; I just want to appreciate and value every learning opportunity. Besides viewing this process as a foundation for future knowledge and abilities, I have been anticipating this stage of gaining deeper and professional knowledge in psychology for a long time. To summarize, this goal is elicited from my passion and enthusiasm for psychology, to remain focused throughout these three years, instead of gaining fame or impress others. After graduation, I want to engage in a job related to psychology, allowing me to serve others by applying the knowledge learnt. It may not need to be anything very great; I just hope to contribute to the society’s wellbeing, whether it is in the clinical setting, corporate world or any other aspects. Most importantly, I hope to raise awareness and acceptance towards mental disorders. Even though my effort alone may not be significant to the society, I believe that my effort would at least support those in my surrounding</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>My Ideal Person Essay</strong><p>Human beings are not perfect. We all have some form of deficiency that deny us the coveted tag of perfection. It may be a character flaw or a physical disability. We all have something that we are not proud of. Something that makes us so uncomfortable that our confidence levels plummet to zero whenever we think about it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While there are things we cannot change about ourselves, such as height, intelligence, race or size of our fingers, there are other factors in our lives that we can change and they are the ones that really matter. We are not remembered for our tallness or brownness, we are remembered for our virtues or vices. Therefore, an ideal person is one who possesses all character traits that are considered virtues in society.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When I talk about an ideal person, one person comes to mind- Mother Teresa. Her name has become synonymous with sacrifice and selfless generosity. People know her from all over the world, both in the religious and secular circles. Though she was not perfect, her life embodied what I would refer to as the ideal personality. One of her best qualities was piety. She was a very faithful and religious woman.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother Teresa was a staunch catholic. At the tender age of 18 years, she joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin and became a nun. She therefore dedicated all her life towards a religious and humanitarian course and never looked back. There were instances where she felt like God had forgotten her and even questioned whether God really existed. However, she never left her catholic faith.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She was also very generous. She spent most of her life serving the poor. Form her own account, which she labeled as “a call within a call,” God spoke to her and commanded her to go help the slum dwellers in Calcutta, India. After receiving approval from Vatican, she relocated to Calcutta for the rest of her life. Using her meagre resources, she wholeheartedly helped the poor and the sick.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She left behind a lifestyle of stability and opulence, took a vow of charity, chastity and poverty and then went to a foreign country to live with the destitute. During her life, she suffered from many illnesses and injuries, including malaria, pneumonia and two heart attacks. She also had broken collar bone. The several setbacks she faced however did not deter her from moving on with her course.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother Teresa was also a leader and she led by example. When she saw things were not okay and people were suffering, she took it upon herself to help them. With all the poverty and misery that surrounded her, she always had the strength to put on a smile. One of the traits of great leaders is that they always give people hope when there seems to be none.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That was Mother Teresa. People rushed to her for comfort and assistance and she always found a way to help them. When she arrived in Calcutta, there was wide spread of diseases in the slums. She went to a medical institution, trained to be practitioner and went back to the slums to treat the affected. She also established various health centers to deal with the rampant spread of diseases, including leprosy that was wreaking havoc in the slums.</p><p></p><p>She was also very principled. She had her own set of beliefs that she followed to the letter and never faltered whenever she faced criticism or opposition. She openly opposed divorce, abortion and contraception. While receiving her Nobel Peace Prize for her unwavering service to humanity, she aired her critique on abortion without fear. She opined in her speech, “…I feel the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a direct war- a direct murder by the mother herself…” Although she received too much public backlash for her stance on abortion, contraception and divorce, she was unperturbed and made it clear to the whole world about her position.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
