Review of Related Literature is one of the major activities in research that makes you examine or studyagain the concepts or ideas related to your research that people managed to publish in books, journalsor other reading materials in the past.2. RRL is an important component of research regardless of the type of research.3. Examining of the written works related to your study is necessary.4. Finding out the connection of your study to the current conditions or situations in the world is thepurpose of RRL.5. Knowing more about theories or concepts underlying your research work and to learn from them withrespect to your own research study must be observed.6. To discover the relation of your research with the previous research studies is not totally important.7. Printed books, journals, magazines and Newspaper are examples of reading material to be used in RRL.8. RRL does not offer concepts, ideas and information for the study.9. RRL is an analysis of man's written or spoken knowledge of the world to determine the connection ofyour research with what people already know about it.10. Conceptual review is an analysis of concepts or ideas to give meaning to some national or world issues.​</a>

Significance of the Study.The researches thought that if this study would be successful, it would be able to help the community in preventing harmful diseases from insects, most especially from mosquitoes, also in a way that it would be natural. Oregano is effective because it is versatile. Also because it can easily be found in the neighbourhood, so there would be no need for families, especially those less fortunates, to use money that can be used instead for food or other necessities.Note:The "researchers" not researches.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Significance of the Study: Exploring the Effectiveness of Oregano Extract as a Natural Mosquito Repellent</p><p>Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue, malaria, and Zika, pose a significant health risk to communities worldwide. Insecticides and other chemical-based repellents have been used to prevent mosquito bites, but the harmful effects of these products on human health and the environment have been widely documented. Therefore, there is a need for a natural and safe alternative that can effectively repel mosquitoes.</p><p>The significance of this study lies in its potential to provide a natural and affordable solution to prevent harmful diseases from insects, specifically mosquitoes. Oregano is an herb that is readily available in most communities, and its effectiveness as a mosquito repellent has been suggested by previous studies. By exploring the effectiveness of oregano extract as a natural mosquito repellent, this study can provide valuable insights into the development of safe and effective mosquito control strategies.</p><p>In addition, this study can benefit communities, especially those with limited resources, by providing a cost-effective and accessible solution for mosquito control. Oregano extract is easy to make and does not require expensive equipment or materials, making it a viable option for families, especially those who cannot afford chemical-based repellents. By providing a natural alternative to commercial mosquito repellents, this study can help families save money that can be used for other necessities.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of oregano extract as a mosquito repellent can promote sustainability and environmental consciousness. Unlike chemical-based repellents, which can have adverse effects on the environment, oregano extract is a natural and eco-friendly solution. By promoting the use of natural products for mosquito control, this study can contribute to the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in the community.</p><p>Overall, this study's significance lies in its potential to provide a safe, affordable, and accessible solution to prevent harmful mosquito-borne diseases while promoting sustainability and environmental consciousness in the community.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
