TOPIC: WHY FILIPINOS NEED TO STAY AT HOME UNTIL DECEMBER (OR EVEN LONGER) Think of your favorite zombie movie or video game. How do people survive in those fictional situations? They avoid contact with the infected usually by quarantining themselves. That's exactly what isolation does in our present situation. Some people think this is all an overreaction. We've seen plenty of comments on Android Authority articles from readers who think that there's no reason for self-isolation during this pandemic. We've even seen people call this whole thing a hoax. I think we need to stay at home until December (or even longer) because COVID-19 spreads very easily, asymptomatic persons do exist, and there is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19 yet.

How do people survive in those fictional situations? They avoid contact with the infected usually by quarantining themselves. That's exactly what isolation does in our present situation. Some people think this is all an overreaction. We've seen plenty of comments on Android Authority articles from readers who think that there's no reason for self-isolation during this pandemic. We've even seen people call this whole thing a hoax. I think we need to stay at home until December (or even longer) because COVID-19 spreads very easily, asymptomatic persons do exist, and there is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19 yet. What will the first body paragraph be about? What will the second body paragraph be about? What will the third body paragraph be about? What will be the concluding paragraph? 4 | ENGLISH 10 FOURTH QUARTER WEEK 7​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First body paragraph: The first body paragraph will likely provide evidence and arguments supporting the statement that COVID-19 spreads very easily. It may discuss the high transmission rate of the virus, the importance of social distancing measures, and examples of how the virus has spread rapidly in different regions.</p><p></p><p>Second body paragraph: The second body paragraph will focus on the existence of asymptomatic individuals and their role in the spread of COVID-19. It may discuss studies and cases that have demonstrated how asymptomatic carriers can unknowingly transmit the virus to others, emphasizing the need for caution and preventive measures even in the absence of apparent symptoms.</p><p></p><p>Third body paragraph: The third body paragraph will address the absence of a cure or vaccine for COVID-19. It may discuss the challenges in developing a vaccine, the importance of mitigating the spread through isolation and preventive measures until a cure or effective vaccine becomes available, and the potential consequences of lifting restrictions prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Concluding paragraph: The concluding paragraph will summarize the main points discussed in the body paragraphs, reiterating the importance of staying at home until December (or longer). It may emphasize the need for collective responsibility and solidarity in combating the pandemic, urging readers to prioritize public health and safety over personal conveniences. The conclusion may also provide a call to action, encouraging readers to stay informed, follow guidelines, and contribute to the collective effort of controlling the spread of COVID-19.</p><br />
