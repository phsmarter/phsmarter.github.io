Drafting a Descriptive Essay d. Revising a Descriptive Essay e. Editing a Descriptive Essay b. Publishing a Descriptive Essay c. Prewriting for the Descriptive Essay In the prewriting phase of descriptive essay writing, students should take time to think about who or what they want to describe and why. The topic doesn't have to be famous or unusual. The person could be a grandparent, an object, a favorite toy, a place, or a tree house. When creating the initial draft of a descriptive essay, follow the outline, but remember, the goal is to give the reader a rich experience of the subject. In the revision phase. students review, modify, and reorganize their work with the goal of making it the best it can be. In revising a descriptive essay, students should reread their work with these considerations in mind. At this point in the writing process, writers proofread and correct errors in grammar and mechanics. It's also the time to improve style and clarity. Watch out for clichés and loading up on adjectives and adverbs. Having a friend read the essay helps writers see trouble spots and edit with a fresh perspective. Sharing the descriptive essay with the rest of the class can be both exciting and a bit scary. Remember, there isn't a writer on earth who isn't sensitive about his or her own work. The important thing is to learn from the experience and take whatever feedback is given to make the next essay even better.​</a>

                                            Assignment essay tasks are set to assist students to develop mastery of their study subject. Firstly, assignment tasks enhance understanding about subject matter. (Yang and Baker 2005, p. 1) reason that “to master your learning materials and extend your understanding, you need to write about the meanings you gain from your research”. Secondly, research (Jinx, 2004; Zapper, 2006) clearly demonstrates that students learn the writing conventions of a subject area while they are researching, reading and writing in their discipline. This activity helps them to “crack the code” of the discipline (Bloggs, 2003, p. 44). Thus, students are learning subject matter and how to write in that disciplinary area by researching and writing assignment essays. (111 words/6 sentences)

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The kinetic molecular theory can be used to describe the behavior of solids and liquids, just as it can for gaseous substances. An atom, molecule, or ion will be referred to as a particle in the following definition. It's worth noting that we'll use the term "intermolecular attraction" to refer to the attractive forces that exist between the particles of a substance, regardless of whether these particles are atoms or molecules. The strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make up each phase are reflected in the properties of a solid, liquid, or gas. The relative extents of a substance's intermolecular forces (IMFs) and the kinetic energies (KE) of its molecules determine the process in which it resides. The different forces of attraction that can exist between the atoms are referred to as IMFs.</p><br />

                            12. Assignment essay tasks are set to assist students to develop mastery of their study subject. Firstly, assignment tasks enhance understanding about subject matter. (Yang and Baker 2005, p. 1) reason that “to master your learning materials and extend your understanding, you need to write about the meanings you gain from your research”. Secondly, research (Jinx, 2004; Zapper, 2006) clearly demonstrates that students learn the writing conventions of a subject area while they are researching, reading and writing in their discipline. This activity helps them to “crack the code” of the discipline (Bloggs, 2003, p. 44). Thus, students are learning subject matter and how to write in that disciplinary area by researching and writing assignment essays. (111 words/6 sentences)
