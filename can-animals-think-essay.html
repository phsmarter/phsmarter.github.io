Question text
Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.

                                            Differences Between Tokyo and Kyoto
In recent decades, the title of one of the most popular cultures worldwide should be definitely given to Japan. Millions of people all over the world study the Japanese language, watch dorama (dramatic TV series on all kinds of topics) or animation, read and write haiku, and make pen pals with Japanese people. Countless people buy tickets and fly to the country of the rising sun to see its wonders with their own eyes.
Among the most popular destinations—mostly because these city names are most known to the western public—are Tokyo and Kyoto. And perhaps for an inexperienced traveler, there is a dilemma: where to go? Mostly, people know that Tokyo is a mega city of the future, and Kyoto has more to do with ancient culture, traditions, and so on. Basically it is true, but at the same time, there also exist more subtle differences one should consider when choosing their destination point in Japan.
The first of them is prices. Tokyo is expensive—as you might expect from the capital of the most urbanized country in the world (the prices below are listed in Japanese yen: 1 USD approximately equals 100 yen). So, to grab some inexpensive snack in Tokyo would cost around 850 yen. Having a three-course meal for two people in a mid-range restaurant, in case you travel with your spouse, will cost you 5,230 yen. A one-way ticket on Tokyo transport costs you 190 yen, and renting one room apartment outside of the city center costs 77,853 yen (and this is probably a weekly price). Just do not expect this apartment to be big and cozy; most likely it will be tiny, with basic utilities, and with no central heating (actually, there is no such thing in Japan at all—everyone warms their house up on their own). If you think of buying an apartment in Tokyo, forget it—one square meter of a room outside of the city center is around 1 million yen (double the price if you want to live closer to the city center).
Kyoto is not much cheaper. Although dining in a restaurant is cheaper—only 4,000 yen for two persons in a mid-range restaurant—transportation costs are surprisingly higher: 235 yen for a ride (however, if you want to purchase a monthly pass, it is cheaper to do in Kyoto rather than in Tokyo: 8,410 yen compared to 10,000 yen). If you think you can save some money buying food in a market, you are correct only in particulars: some products in Japan cost a lot of money no matter where you buy them. For example, white rice costs 850 yen for 1 kg in Kyoto (453 yen in Tokyo). White bread, tomatoes, chicken breasts, and especially cheese—these are the most expensive products both in Kyoto and in Tokyo. Speaking of accommodation, renting or buying an apartment in Kyoto is much cheaper: for a one room apartment outside of Kyoto’s center, you must pay 48,000 yen to rent, or 300,000 yen per square meter if you want to buy it (Numbeo.com).
Tokyo is great to visit if you enjoy hustle and bustle, if you want to feel the heartbeat of a mega-city, dive into its life, and experience all those crazy things people in the West usually tell about Japan. Be prepared for the overcrowded subway— and “overcrowded” is a gentle way to put it; in fact, you can take a 60-minute ride in the subway, and your feet will not even touch the floor, because you will be squeezed between other people so tight that you can even take a nap in this position. Kyoto, on the other hand, is good to visit for all those who feel inspired by traditional Japanese culture: haiku, hanami, court customs, the No theater, and so on. In Kyoto, you will not see amazing skyscrapers, over 280 subway stations, and the craziness of the famous Shibuya crossing; instead, get prepared for temples, tea houses, museums: all things antique and authentic. But, if you want modernity, go to Tokyo, and you will not feel disappointed—this city already lives in the future (Go Overseas).
It is difficult to say which city is better for an inexperienced tourist to visit, Tokyo or Kyoto. Kyoto is cheaper, especially in terms of renting an apartment, and is more suitable for those looking for the old Japanese culture weaved into sophisticated palaces made during Heian-jidai. Tokyo, on the contrary, is an enormous metropolis, with crazy prices, crazy transportation, crazy everything. The atmospheres are different, but both of the cities will make you awed, so if you have a chance, you should definitely visit them.

Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</a>

                                            11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

Question text
Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.

                            9. Differences Between Tokyo and Kyoto
In recent decades, the title of one of the most popular cultures worldwide should be definitely given to Japan. Millions of people all over the world study the Japanese language, watch dorama (dramatic TV series on all kinds of topics) or animation, read and write haiku, and make pen pals with Japanese people. Countless people buy tickets and fly to the country of the rising sun to see its wonders with their own eyes.
Among the most popular destinations—mostly because these city names are most known to the western public—are Tokyo and Kyoto. And perhaps for an inexperienced traveler, there is a dilemma: where to go? Mostly, people know that Tokyo is a mega city of the future, and Kyoto has more to do with ancient culture, traditions, and so on. Basically it is true, but at the same time, there also exist more subtle differences one should consider when choosing their destination point in Japan.
The first of them is prices. Tokyo is expensive—as you might expect from the capital of the most urbanized country in the world (the prices below are listed in Japanese yen: 1 USD approximately equals 100 yen). So, to grab some inexpensive snack in Tokyo would cost around 850 yen. Having a three-course meal for two people in a mid-range restaurant, in case you travel with your spouse, will cost you 5,230 yen. A one-way ticket on Tokyo transport costs you 190 yen, and renting one room apartment outside of the city center costs 77,853 yen (and this is probably a weekly price). Just do not expect this apartment to be big and cozy; most likely it will be tiny, with basic utilities, and with no central heating (actually, there is no such thing in Japan at all—everyone warms their house up on their own). If you think of buying an apartment in Tokyo, forget it—one square meter of a room outside of the city center is around 1 million yen (double the price if you want to live closer to the city center).
Kyoto is not much cheaper. Although dining in a restaurant is cheaper—only 4,000 yen for two persons in a mid-range restaurant—transportation costs are surprisingly higher: 235 yen for a ride (however, if you want to purchase a monthly pass, it is cheaper to do in Kyoto rather than in Tokyo: 8,410 yen compared to 10,000 yen). If you think you can save some money buying food in a market, you are correct only in particulars: some products in Japan cost a lot of money no matter where you buy them. For example, white rice costs 850 yen for 1 kg in Kyoto (453 yen in Tokyo). White bread, tomatoes, chicken breasts, and especially cheese—these are the most expensive products both in Kyoto and in Tokyo. Speaking of accommodation, renting or buying an apartment in Kyoto is much cheaper: for a one room apartment outside of Kyoto’s center, you must pay 48,000 yen to rent, or 300,000 yen per square meter if you want to buy it (Numbeo.com).
Tokyo is great to visit if you enjoy hustle and bustle, if you want to feel the heartbeat of a mega-city, dive into its life, and experience all those crazy things people in the West usually tell about Japan. Be prepared for the overcrowded subway— and “overcrowded” is a gentle way to put it; in fact, you can take a 60-minute ride in the subway, and your feet will not even touch the floor, because you will be squeezed between other people so tight that you can even take a nap in this position. Kyoto, on the other hand, is good to visit for all those who feel inspired by traditional Japanese culture: haiku, hanami, court customs, the No theater, and so on. In Kyoto, you will not see amazing skyscrapers, over 280 subway stations, and the craziness of the famous Shibuya crossing; instead, get prepared for temples, tea houses, museums: all things antique and authentic. But, if you want modernity, go to Tokyo, and you will not feel disappointed—this city already lives in the future (Go Overseas).
It is difficult to say which city is better for an inexperienced tourist to visit, Tokyo or Kyoto. Kyoto is cheaper, especially in terms of renting an apartment, and is more suitable for those looking for the old Japanese culture weaved into sophisticated palaces made during Heian-jidai. Tokyo, on the contrary, is an enormous metropolis, with crazy prices, crazy transportation, crazy everything. The atmospheres are different, but both of the cities will make you awed, so if you have a chance, you should definitely visit them.

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1.

Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</h2><br />

Adopting a Pet from the Pound Owning a pet from the pound or Animal Rescue League has many advantages. First of all a child feels good about rescuing an abandoned or abused animal and giving it a whole new life. Besides, if the animals from the pound aren't adopted right away, they might be put to sleep. Having a pet also means lots of responsibilities.

                            22. 11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.
