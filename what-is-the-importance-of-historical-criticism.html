                            16. III.b. Write the letter of the correct answer on the blank provided before each number. 6. Formalist criticism focuses on the text itself. Which of the following is not included in critiquing the form of a particular short story? A. literary devices B. moral of the story C. elements of a short story D. figures of speech 7. Which of the following is not included in the analysis using the Marxist approach? A. author's style of writing using literary devices B. social classes that constitute the setting of the story (their importance and role to run the plot and in injecting ideas) C. author's message on the issue or problem whether stated directly through Characters or merely implied D. author's idea about the prevailing social issue like oppression 8. Reader response critics are not interested in a "correct" interpretation of a text or what the author intended. They are interested in A. political and historical background of the story B. reader's individual experience while or after reading a text. C. inequality of gender issues raised D. the ethics and morals the story gives 9. Padre Damaso, a Franciscan Spanish priest supposed to be the personification of Christianism had committed abuses such as ordering the exhumation and transfer of Don Rafael's body to the Chinese cemetery. In the later part of the novel, it was revealed that he abused Dona Pia Alba, making him the father of Maria Clara. What approach will you use to develop a literary criticism for these details? A. Historical B. Marxist 10. Criticism that places literature in a social context and attempts to understand representation from a woman's point of view is called A. Marxist B. Reader-response C. Moralist D. Formalist C. Feminist D. Moralist​</h2><br />
                        <p>6 B</p><p>7 A</p><p>8 B</p><p>9 A</p><p>10 C</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>6) The answer is B, moral of the story. Formalist criticism is concerned with analyzing the form of a work of literature, such as the literary devices used and the elements of a short story, to better understand the meaning and impact of the text. The moral of the story, however, is not a formal aspect of the text, but rather a thematic one.</p><p></p><p>7) The answer is A, author's style of writing using literary devices. Marxist criticism focuses on the ways in which literature reflects and reinforces social and economic inequality, particularly in terms of social class. This approach analyzes the social classes portrayed in the story, the author's message about social issues, and the role of these issues in shaping the plot and themes of the text. The author's style of writing is not typically of interest to Marxist critics.</p><p></p><p>8) The answer is B, reader's individual experience while or after reading a text. Reader-response criticism is concerned with how readers interpret and respond to a text, and the ways in which their personal experiences, biases, and cultural backgrounds influence this interpretation. This approach is less concerned with a "correct" interpretation of the text or the author's intentions, and more focused on understanding how different readers might respond to the same text in different ways.</p><p></p><p>9) The answer is A, historical. Historical criticism is concerned with understanding a text within the context of its historical period, including the social, cultural, and political factors that may have influenced its creation and reception. In the case of Padre Damaso's character in Jose Rizal's "Noli Me Tangere," historical criticism could be used to examine the historical context of the novel's setting and the role of the Spanish colonial government in the Philippines at the time.</p><p></p><p>10) The answer is C, feminist. Feminist criticism is concerned with analyzing literature from a gendered perspective, particularly with regard to the ways in which women are represented and how gender roles and power dynamics are depicted in the text. This approach often seeks to uncover and challenge patriarchal assumptions and biases in literature, and to highlight the experiences and perspectives of women in the text.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Some primary sources may be judged more reliable than others, but every source is biased in some way. As a result, historians read sources skeptically and critically. They also cross-check sources against other evidence and sources. ...

2. In the context of Marcos as a war hero, why it is important to perform external and internal criticisms on historical sources?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>.</strong>Without specific information about the claim in question, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to this question. However, in general, people may continue to believe a claim even if it has been debunked or proven false due to a variety of factors. These factors may include personal beliefs or biases, emotional attachment to the claim, lack of exposure to information that contradicts the claim, or misinformation campaigns that intentionally spread false information. Additionally, people may rely on anecdotal evidence or personal experiences rather than empirical evidence when forming beliefs, which can contribute to the persistence of false claims.</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>It is important to perform external and internal criticisms on historical sources in the context of Marcos as a war hero because it allows us to assess the accuracy and reliability of the information presented in those sources. External criticism involves evaluating the credibility of the source itself, such as considering the author's credentials, potential biases, and the historical context in which the source was produced. Internal criticism involves evaluating the content of the source itself, such as assessing its consistency with other historical sources and examining any inconsistencies or contradictions within the source. By performing these types of criticisms, we can better understand the context in which historical claims are made and make more accurate assessments of their veracity. In the case of Marcos as a war hero, external and internal criticisms can help to separate fact from fiction and prevent the spread of myths and misinformation about his wartime experiences.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Read the selection below and find out how you can analyze and interpret literary text using Marxist Criticism. What is Marxist Criticism / Marxism? - A type of literary criticism based on the writings of German philosopher Karl Marx. It is a critical approach to literature which shows the relationship between literature and the social-mainly economic-conditions under which it was produced. Originally, Manist critics focused on literary representations of workers and working classes. For later Manxists, however, literature became a document of a kind of knowledge and a record of the historical conditions that produced that knowfedge. Like cultural criticism, Marxist literary criticism offers critiques of the "canon and focuses on the ways in which culture and power intersect; for a Marxist critic, literature both reproduces existing power relations and offers a space where they can be contested and redefined. Important 20th-century Marxist literary critics include Georg Lucaks. Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Teny Eagleton, Raymond Williams, and Frederic Jameson. Some of the key concepts of Marxism include worker's uprising, materialism, class struggle, effect of capitalism, classless society, ideology, and working class​</h2><br />

                        <p>Historical and Reader-Response Approaches to literary criticism can be important to me as a reader because they provide different perspectives and ways of understanding and interpreting literature. The Historical Approach can help me understand the context in which a work was written and how it may have been influenced by the events and culture of its time. The Reader-Response Approach, on the other hand, focuses on my personal experience and interpretation of the text. This approach can help me connect with the text on a more personal level and can also encourage me to think critically about my own reactions and interpretations. Both approaches can enrich my understanding and appreciation of literature.</p><br />
