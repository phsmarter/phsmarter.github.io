1. Place a book on top of a table. What keeps the book from falling?
How is this possible?
2. Roll a marble on top of a level surface. Make it stop. Slide a light book
on top of the same level surface by giving it an initial push. Did the
book continue to slide? What is responsible for making the sliding
book slow down and eventually stop?
3. Drop a small stone and a piece of paper from the same height at the
same time. Observe closely the motion of the stone and the paper

1. Place a book on top of a table. What keeps the book from falling?
How is this possible?
2. Roll a marble on top of a level surface. Make it stop. Slide a light book
on top of the same level surface by giving it an initial push. Did the
book continue to slide? What is responsible for making the sliding
book slow down and eventually stop?
3. Drop a small stone and a piece of paper from the same height at the

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The table stops the book from falling.</p><p>2. Because of the book and the force change, the marble going down is now going up and because of the gravity it slows down.</p><p>3. the rock hit the ground first because the rock has more mass the the paper and more mass attract gravity more.</p><p>4. It is really important like if where going to make a fire we need a lightstick and we create a friction to make it.</p><p>5. we really need gravity because it's hard to move on a zero gravity like in space if you jump you go forever because no one stops you.</p><br />

                            12. what is the importance of refraction of light in our daily life ?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Refraction of light is an important phenomenon that occurs when light travels through a medium with a different optical density, such as from air to water or from air to glass. Here are some examples of the importance of refraction of light in our daily life:</p><p></p><p>1. Corrective lenses: Refraction is the principle behind corrective lenses used to correct vision problems. Glasses, contact lenses, and intraocular lenses work by bending light to focus it properly on the retina, which can improve vision.</p><p></p><p>2. Cameras: Refraction is also used in cameras to focus the image on the film or sensor. The lens in a camera bends the light to form a sharp image on the film or sensor, which is then recorded as a photograph.</p><p></p><p>3. Prisms: Prisms use refraction to split light into its component colors. This is useful in spectroscopy, where different materials can be identified by the unique colors they absorb or emit.</p><p></p><p>4. Mirage: Refraction causes mirages, which are optical illusions that occur when light is bent by the atmosphere, creating a distorted image of distant objects. This phenomenon is commonly observed in deserts or on hot roads.</p><p></p><p>5. Magnifying glass: A magnifying glass works by using refraction to make an object appear larger than it is. The lens of the magnifying glass bends the light, which makes the object appear closer and larger.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the refraction of light is an important phenomenon that has many practical applications in our daily life, from correcting vision problems to capturing photographs to identifying materials. It has enabled us to see and understand the world around us in ways that would not have been possible otherwise.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Because it is important to how to be successful Ang refraction and you must be willing to your daily life and relationship</p><br />

The marble did not keep slipping. The stone is sliding and slowing down due to <strong>friction.</strong></p><p>3. Since the stone weighs more than the paper, it makes sense that it will fall to the ground first.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>For example, when a book is placed on a table, the normal force keeps the book from falling through the table. Gravity is pulling the book downward, but since the book isn't actually falling, something must be pushing it up. This force is called the normal force</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>the sliding of the book cannot continue because the friction will slow down the sliding book to stop completely</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Stone </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Friction can slow things down and stop stationary things from moving.

<p>
</p>2) The book did not continue to slide. Friction is responsible for making the sliding book slow down and eventually stop.
<p>
</p>3) The stone is much speeder because it's flat and the stone is small so it motion to our gravity is slow.

The three transmissions of light are reflection, transmission, and absorption.</p><p></p><p>3. Examples of each transmission are:</p><p></p><p>-Reflection: When light strikes a smooth surface and bounces back, such as a mirror reflecting an image or a pool reflecting the sky.</p><p></p><p>-Transmission: When light passes through a transparent or translucent material, such as a window allowing sunlight to enter a room or a prism separating white light into its component colors.</p><p></p><p>-Absorption: When light is absorbed by an opaque material, such as a black wall absorbing all the light that falls on it or a plant absorbing light for photosynthesis.</p><p></p><p>4. Light is important in our daily life for many reasons, including:</p><p>Vision: Light allows us to see the world around us and perceive colors, shapes, and textures.</p><p></p><p>-Health: Exposure to natural light can help regulate our sleep-wake cycle, boost mood, and support vitamin D synthesis.</p><p></p><p>-Communication: Light is used in various forms of communication, such as signaling with flashlights or using fiber optics to transmit data.</p><p></p><p>-Technology: Light is used in various technologies, such as lasers, LEDs, and solar panels.</p><p></p><p>-Aesthetics: Light is used in art, architecture, and design to create atmosphere, highlight features, and add beauty to our surroundings.</p><br />
