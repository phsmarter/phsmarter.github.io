                                            Direction: Read the Checklist for Formalist Criticism and use it as a guide in critiquing a selection. A formalist critic analyzes: how the work is structured or organized (formed) how it begins how it is advancing or transiting to the next line how it ends ✓ how the plot is built how each part of the work relates to the work as a whole how the narrator or speaker narrates the story what is the point of view of the narrator who are the major and minor characters how the characters are related to one another what are the actions of the characters what are the literary devices used ✓ how the literary devices function to create meaning Directions: Read the story from Benguet and discover the origin of rice and small streams. The Origin of Rice and Streams (Ibaloy Tale) Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but went on living each day as best as they could. Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling footholds among the hilly paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand. The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell what you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal. One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am too blind and I cannot work for a living in the fields." The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I, too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring." The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty. To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both thanked the old woman profusely and they felt their way back home. They lived together happily, never wanting any more than what they already had. After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So, the one who owned the magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch water for their various needs.

                            8. Direction: Read the Checklist for Formalist Criticism and use it as a guide in critiquing a selection. A formalist critic analyzes: how the work is structured or organized (formed) how it begins how it is advancing or transiting to the next line how it ends ✓ how the plot is built how each part of the work relates to the work as a whole how the narrator or speaker narrates the story what is the point of view of the narrator who are the major and minor characters how the characters are related to one another what are the actions of the characters what are the literary devices used ✓ how the literary devices function to create meaning Directions: Read the story from Benguet and discover the origin of rice and small streams. The Origin of Rice and Streams (Ibaloy Tale) Once upon a time, there were two blind women. They were kindhearted, but they were very poor. In order to eat, they had to beg from their neighbors and sometimes they were driven away or given nothing. Nevertheless, they did not complain but went on living each day as best as they could. Once when they had no food for some time, they decided to walk to the next village to try their luck there. They walked slowly, feeling footholds among the hilly paths. When they had walked some distance, they bumped into a large rock. The impact sent their bodies reeling. Dazed, they held on to each other and tried to get back on their feet. But they had gone too long without food, and now they could not even stand. The rock opened magically, and out of its granite depths a young woman emerged. She took the two blind women by the hand and let them inside. An old woman seated them at a stone table and gave them food to eat. "Now tell what you need," said the old woman to them when they had finished their meal. One of the blind women said, "I am always hungry. I need food, but I am too blind and I cannot work for a living in the fields." The other replied, "I am always thirsty. I always need something to drink, but I, too, am blind and I cannot find my way even to the smallest spring." The old woman gave the first woman a sack of rice that would never be empty. To the other she gave a bottle of water that would never be drained dry. They both thanked the old woman profusely and they felt their way back home. They lived together happily, never wanting any more than what they already had. After some time, though, they told each other that it was not right to keep to themselves the good fortune that they had been given. So, the one who owned the magic sack of rice took a handful of grain and sowed it; when the grain was harvested she gave it to the people in the village. The one who owned the magic bottle poured some of the water out onto the land where it changed into many small brooks and streams. On their banks flowers soon grew, and to the streams people came to fetch water for their various needs.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This Ibaloy tale is structured in a traditional folktale format, beginning with the introduction of two blind women who are poor and must beg for food. The plot then follows their journey to the next village, where they encounter a magical rock that opens up and reveals an old woman who gives them a sack of rice and bottle of water that will never be empty or drained dry. The story ends with the two women sharing their good fortune with others by sowing some of the rice and pouring out some of the water, which turns into small streams. </p><p></p><p>The point of view is third person omniscient, as it allows readers to understand what is happening from both characters' perspectives. The major characters are the two blind women, while minor characters include the old woman from within the rock and those in their village who benefit from their generosity. </p><p></p><p>The actions taken by these characters include walking to another village, bumping into a large rock, being given food by an old woman inside it, receiving gifts from her (a sack of rice and bottle of water), returning home happily together afterwards, sowing some grain from one's sack and pouring out some water from one's bottle so that it turns into small streams for others to use. </p><p></p><p>Literary devices used in this story include imagery (the hilly paths they walk on) as well as personification (the rock opening magically). These devices help create meaning by providing vivid descriptions that bring life to this tale about how kindness can be rewarded through generosity towards others.</p><br />

Feminist / Gender Criticism. This viewpoint considers particular aspects of the political content of the text, the author, the historical and socio-cultural context of the work, and the cultural, political, and personal situation of the reader in relationship to the text.​</h2><br />
