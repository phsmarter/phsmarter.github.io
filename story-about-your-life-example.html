Culture can be associated with a specific nationality, race, geographic area, or religion, just to name a few examples. Having insight into the culture of the characters in a novel or other work of writing provides important insights relevant to interpreting the story or situation. For example: A book or story about growing up will be very different if the main character's culture is one that values independence and making one's own way in the world as opposed to one in which young people are expected to follow in the footsteps of their parents and grandparents. A news story written by a reporter in a country that values free and unbiased journalism where the legal structure guarantees freedom of the press is likely to be very different from one in which the government controls the news media or journalists can be punished for speaking out about certain issues.​</a>

                                            Give an example of a quote: Any quote is accepted except for rude ones.
Mine: "Sometimes you say that you are never wrong, but in reality, you are also never perfect, so don't hold something you know against another you never knew."
My 2nd Example: "Life is somehow pretty tough, but you know what keeps you stronger? the way you cry is how you show your pain to others, and if others think you are weak, they are too blind to see the closeness of your strength because crying doesn't make you weak, you've just stayed strong for a particular time, and you can continue to do all this for as much as long you can hold it for, so there's no need to compliment yourself inadequately, we are all equal and we're just humans, but there is a difference between us, it's about the habits we have and what we wave for when we want to show a different path between sins and forgiveness..."
My 3rd Example: "Sometimes words may hurt others, but don't let them hurt you, you should be the one giving them hope, the time you realize it's you making them experience to not give up."
My 4th Example: "Knowing is meticulous, but experiencing is even more considerable, it makes you realize perpetually."
My 5th Example: "Every story has to give the main character a problem to face and solve it. If he or she can't solve it, then there's no point in making a chronicle, if the story keeps going on without an end, then you're making a whole life history, there's no other way to keep going on, it's just between life and death."

                                            Be aware that the "simple present tense" is an oddity. Despite its name, it is not always about activities in the present. The simple present tense can be used for activities that are not currently happening, and it can be used for future events. It is used: 1. To describe facts and habits. For example: He plays chess. 2. To describe scheduled events in the future. For example: The plane lands in 5 minutes. 3. To tell stories (particularly jokes). For example: He asks the policeman for directions. 4. To describe facts and habits. For example: Angela runs a youth club full of glue-sniffers. (Fact) I ride horses in the summer. (Fact and habit) 5. To describe scheduled events in the future. For example: The train arrives at 5 o'clock. 6. To tell stories (particularly jokes) to make your listener or reader feel more engaged with the story. For example: We heard the helicopter overhead. Suddenly, the radio bursts into life.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I was just a girl who lived an ordinary life. A life that I lived, I liked. I liked how my days are good, or when it's bad. I don't think much about guys, nor feel any intimacy with one. I'm not even scared of them—I just feel numb. I don't feel love, nor don't feel hate. I'm like someone who's both alive and dead. But not until I've gone through a hard time of my life.</p><p>There was a day where I got tired of the world. I've got tired of living my life, to the point where I wanted things to come to end. Surprisingly, he came into the background. He was like a sunlight that shined into my darkest days. He holds me close, keeps me safe—and I do feel safe. I feel like we can overcome the world when we're together. Funny, how things got so much easier for me. Things were great and good, and it feels nice. My feet were stumbling in a rock, but he's always there holding me up.</p><p>My story was miserable, not until he came into my life. He became my life, and I became his. We endured, love each other, and were able to pass the tests of this life. Even things are like these, I'm happy. I'm happy that he's around, and is always there to reach his hand and make me feel safe. I love him. And that's how our story goes.</p><p>cttro</p><p></p><br />

One summer, my family and I decided to take a road trip to the countryside. It was a long and tiring journey, but the sight of the rolling hills and vast greenery made it all worth it. We arrived at a small town nestled in the heart of the countryside, and we were greeted by friendly locals who welcomed us with open arms.</p><p></p><p>One of the highlights of our trip was visiting a local farm. We were given a tour of the vast fields where we saw rows upon rows of crops and vegetables. We also saw different farm animals such as cows, pigs, and chickens. It was fascinating to see how everything worked, from the seed planting to the harvesting. We even got to try some of the fresh produce, and it was the best-tasting food I have ever had. I will never forget the feeling of the warm sun on my face as we explored the farm, and the sound of the animals in the background.</p><p></p><p>Paragraph 2:</p><p></p><p>Another unforgettable experience from that trip was when we went hiking in the nearby mountains. We woke up early in the morning and started our ascent up the steep trail. The view was breathtaking, and we were surrounded by the beauty of nature. We saw wildflowers, butterflies, and even a deer. As we reached the top, we were rewarded with a panoramic view of the countryside below. It was a sight that I will never forget.</p><p></p><p>On our way back down, we decided to take a different path that led us to a river. The water was crystal clear, and we could see the fish swimming in it. We took off our shoes and dipped our feet in the cool water. We also found some rocks that we used to skip across the river. It was a fun and relaxing way to end our hike.</p><p></p><p>Overall, that road trip to the countryside was one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life. It taught me the importance of exploring new places and trying out new things. It also showed me the beauty of nature and the simple joys it can bring.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Paragraph 1: Growing up, I had always dreamed of traveling to different countries and experiencing different cultures. But little did I know that the most unforgettable experience of my life would happen right in my own backyard. It was a beautiful summer day and my friends and I decided to go on a hike in the nearby mountains. We were all excited to take in the beautiful scenery and spend some quality time outdoors. As we started our hike, we came across a beautiful waterfall that was hidden away in a small cove. The sound of the water cascading down the rocks was like music to our ears, and we knew that we had to get closer to it. We scrambled down the rocks using the crevices between them as a ladder. When we finally made it down, we found ourselves in the most enchanting place I have ever seen.Hearing the roar of the waterfall and feeling its mist on my face was an experience like no other. I sat on a rock by the edge of the water watching the sun dance on its surface like diamonds. The water was cool and refreshing and it felt like it was cleansing my soul. As I sat there, I realized how small I was in the grand scheme of things, and yet how important it was to be in the moment and appreciate the beauty that surrounded me. The sound of the birds chirping, the rustle of the leaves, and the sound of the water gushing were like a symphony that stirred my soul. It was like time stood still, and the world revolved around the beauty we found ourselves in. Paragraph 2: As we made our way back up the hill, I realized that this experience has brought us closer together. We had all pushed our limits, overcame our fears, and worked as a team to get to the waterfall, and back up to the trail. We started to sing songs, tell stories, and laugh like we had never done before. I had made memories that would last a lifetime. As we walked back to our cars, I was grateful for the experience and the people that I had shared it with.The feeling of pure joy and contentment stayed with me for days, and in a way, it changed me. It made me appreciate the simple things in life, and it taught me to live in the moment. I realized that I didn't need to travel to far-off lands to find beauty, that it was all around us, waiting to be discovered with just a little bit of effort. The experience showed me that life is meant to be experienced, lived, and savored. It is the memories that we create that will stay with us forever, and in that moment, I knew that I had created a memory that would be with me for the rest of my life.<br />

                            23. Text-to-self connections are highly perso a reader makes between a piece of reading material and the reader's own experiences or life. Example: are occur This story reminds me of a vacation we took to my grandfather's farm Text-to-text connections when readers reminded of what they have read/viewed with the other books by the same author, stories from a similar text types, or perhaps on the same topic. Readers gain insight during reading by thinking about how the information they are reading connects to other familiar text.

This allows the reader's ideas about how the world works that goes far beyond own experiences. We learn about things through television, movies, magazines, and newspapers. Often, it is the text-to-world connections that teachers are trying to enhance when they teach lessons in science, social studies, and literature. personal Example: I saw a program on television that talked about things described in this article. (http://www.mandygregory.com/makingconnections_mini_lessons.htm) Making connections is truly vital as a comprehension skill since it helps you relate and connect what you heard/read and viewed. Moreover, it enhances your understanding of the text/passages or videos you read or viewed. Lets take this picture as another example for you to understand the competency at hand clearly.​</h2><br />

                        FERMENTATION<p></p><p>What is<strong> Fermentation</strong>?</p><p>Maturation or<strong> Fermentation</strong>, compound cycle by which particles, for example, glucose are separated anaerobically. All the more comprehensively, aging is the frothing that happens during the production of wine and lager, an interaction somewhere around 10,000 years of age.

</p><p>To dominate maturation or <strong>fermentation</strong>, you really want to comprehend the science behind the compound cycle.  </p><p>Microorganisms endure utilizing starches (sugars, like glucose) for energy and fuel.
</p><p>Natural synthetics like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) convey that energy to all aspects of a cell when required.
</p><p>Microorganisms create ATP utilizing breath. High-impact breath, which requires oxygen, is the most effective method for doing that. Oxygen consuming breath starts with glycolysis, where glucose is changed over into pyruvic corrosive. When there's sufficient oxygen present, high-impact breath happens.
</p><p>Maturation or <strong>fermentation </strong>is like anaerobic breath—the sort that happens when there isn't sufficient oxygen present. Be that as it may, maturation prompts the development of various natural particles like lactic corrosive, which additionally prompts ATP, dissimilar to breath, which utilizes pyruvic corrosive.
</p><p>Contingent on natural conditions, individual cells and organisms can switch between the two distinct methods of energy creation.

                            26. Give an example of a quote: Any quote is accepted except for rude ones.
Mine: "Sometimes you say that you are never wrong, but in reality, you are also never perfect, so don't hold something you know against another you never knew."
My 2nd Example: "Life is somehow pretty tough, but you know what keeps you stronger? the way you cry is how you show your pain to others, and if others think you are weak, they are too blind to see the closeness of your strength because crying doesn't make you weak, you've just stayed strong for a particular time, and you can continue to do all this for as much as long you can hold it for, so there's no need to compliment yourself inadequately, we are all equal and we're just humans, but there is a difference between us, it's about the habits we have and what we wave for when we want to show a different path between sins and forgiveness..."
My 3rd Example: "Sometimes words may hurt others, but don't let them hurt you, you should be the one giving them hope, the time you realize it's you making them experience to not give up."
My 4th Example: "Knowing is meticulous, but experiencing is even more considerable, it makes you realize perpetually."
My 5th Example: "Every story has to give the main character a problem to face and solve it. If he or she can't solve it, then there's no point in making a chronicle, if the story keeps going on without an end, then you're making a whole life history, there's no other way to keep going on, it's just between life and death."

                            29. Be aware that the "simple present tense" is an oddity. Despite its name, it is not always about activities in the present. The simple present tense can be used for activities that are not currently happening, and it can be used for future events. It is used: 1. To describe facts and habits. For example: He plays chess. 2. To describe scheduled events in the future. For example: The plane lands in 5 minutes. 3. To tell stories (particularly jokes). For example: He asks the policeman for directions. 4. To describe facts and habits. For example: Angela runs a youth club full of glue-sniffers. (Fact) I ride horses in the summer. (Fact and habit) 5. To describe scheduled events in the future. For example: The train arrives at 5 o'clock. 6.

The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants were always cooking something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always closed, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind. One morning, a policeman knocked on the door of the narrator’s house.

When it was time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who questioned him. The rich man agreed that while their family was having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad, and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the farmer’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooked the food. The narrator’s father committed to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collected some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father was ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed. The judge told the narrator’s father the story where his uncle died because of laughing. The judge likes to hear the narrator's family laughing. The kid’s sisters started to laugh, and all of the people in the courtroom laughed and the judge’s laugh was the loudest of all. </p><p></p><p>Source: English Grade 7 Learner's Material (1st ed.).
