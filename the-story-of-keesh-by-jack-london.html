                        <p>Jack London's short story '"The Story of Keesh" explores the themes of sacrifice and remembrance. The story follows Keesh as he attempts to prove the sacrifices that his father made for his people and incite some remembrance of the losses.</p><p>The conflict in the Story of Keesh is the distrust and misunderestimation of the council members to the 13-year old Keesh. When Keesh went to the council meeting to express his thoughts on the fair sharing of hunted meat, the elders in the meeting questioned and laughed at him.</p><p>The term theme can be defined as the underlying meaning of a story. It is the message the writer is trying to convey through the story. Often the theme of a story is a broad message about life. The theme of a story is important because a story's theme is part of the reason why the author wrote the story.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>SHEP O'NEAL: Keesh lived at the edge of the polar sea. He had seen thirteen suns in the Eskimo way of keeping time. Among the Eskimos, the sun each winter leaves the land in darkness. And the next year, a new sun returns, so it might be warm again.</p><p>The father of Keesh had been a brave man. But he had died hunting for food. Keesh was his only son. Keesh lived along with his mother, Ikeega.</p><p>One night, the village council met in the big igloo of Klosh-kwan, the chief. Keesh was there with the others. He listened, then waited for silence.</p><p>He said, “It is true that you give us some meat. But it is often old and tough meat, and has many bones.”</p><p>The hunters were surprised. This was a child speaking against them. A child talking like a grown man!</p><p>Keesh said, “My father, Bok, was a great hunter. It is said that Bok brought home more meat than any of the two best hunters. And that he divided the meat so that all got an equal share.”</p><p>“Naah! Naah!” the hunters cried. “Put the child out! Send him to bed. He should not talk to gray-beards this way!”</p><p>Keesh waited until the noise stopped. “You have a wife, Ugh-gluk,” he said. “And you speak for her. My mother has no one but me. So I speak. As I say, Bok hunted greatly, but is now dead. It is only fair then that my mother, who was his wife, and I, his son, should have meat when the tribe has meat. I, Keesh, son of Bok, have spoken.”</p><p>Again, there was a great noise in the igloo. The council ordered Keesh to bed. It even talked of giving him no food.</p><p>Keesh jumped to his feet. “Hear me!” he cried. “Never shall I speak in the council igloo again. I shall go hunt meat like my father, Bok.”</p><p>There was much laughter when Keesh spoke of hunting. The laughter followed Keesh as he left the council meeting.</p><p>The next day, Keesh started out for the shore, where the land meets the ice. Those who watched saw that he carried his bow and many arrows. Across his shoulder was his father’s big hunting spear. Again there was laughter.</p><p>One day passed, then a second. On the third day, a great wind blew. There was no sign of Keesh. His mother, Ikeega, put burned seal oil on her face to show her sorrow. </p><br />

                        <p>Jack London's “Story Of Keesh” uses a Marxist literary critique as he based the story on his ideologies and life experiences. Keesh, the son of a hunter, is the main character of the story. The short story's focus is sacrifice, which is often overlooked by the community.</p><p></p><p>The life of the teenage boy named Keesh tells us the struggle for life in an extreme arctic environment where one needs to find the strength to survive. After his father, Bok, died, the tribe forgot the stories about the legendary experiences of his father, which aimed to end famine in the village. The death of his father left Keesh and his mother with a shortage of food that forced him to engage in hunting. Besides, the honor of the dead father inspired the boy to take part and contribute to the tribe’s access to and availability of food.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Keesh in “The Story of Keesh” and Pi in “The Life of Pi” are brave, intelligent, and strategic which helps them survive in extreme environments.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story of Keesh is a short story which was written by Jack London that was first published in January of 1904. Keesh was the son of a great huntsman, who was well known and respected in his tribe. Unfortunately, Keesh’s father died when Keesh was very young. As is often the case, the legendary exploits of Keesh’s father was forgotten with time. After many years, the child grows to be thirteen. Inspired by tales of his father’s skills as a hunter, and emboldened by his self-confidence and the lackluster amount of food being gathered by the tribe, he addressed the village elders in the Igloo of the tribe’s chief. A child addressing the tribal elders was seen as precocious. Keesh declared that he would honor his father’s memory and became a great hunter, and bring back a wealth of meat for his people. He was scorned, and they allowed him to go off on his own. Many never expected to hear from him again. Four days later Keesh returned, with an enormous burden of freshly-killed meat over his shoulders. He explained that an entire polar bear’s carcass laid a day’s travel from the village. The villagers were stunned by this boy having endured the elements and succeeded in his quest, became suspicious. After several more hunting excursions on Keesh’s part, all alone and all resulting in enormous amounts of meat for the tribe, the villagers begin whispering that Keesh is undoubtedly practicing witchcraft. However, they had no choice but to be loyal to this manchild, as he had begun to provide them all with bounteous food. Keesh had the appreciative villagers construct for him an enormous Igloo, rivaling that of the chief. After more speculation and Inuendo as to the source of Keesh’s hunting prowess, it was decided to send two scouts to follow him on a hunting exhibition. They returned several days later, having been successful in trailing Keesh to his kill, an enormous (and dangerous) polar bear. They told a tale that the tribal council simply couldn’t believe. Upon his return, the tribe gathered in Keesh’s igloo to accuse him of witchcraft. He answered their charges well. Keesh explained the source of his hunting success. He explained why the two scouts sent to follow him observed him striding up to the bear, enraging it, and convincing it to follow him. He explained why the scouts witnessed his leaving small round balls of food on the ice for the bear, and why the bear soon became ill, and deranged. He explained how he was then able to spear the bear without endangering himself.
