Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

                                            READING COMPREHENSION
Read the essay below and then answer the questions that follow:
Natural resources are things that we use that come from Earth. Our natural resources are limited. This means that they will not last forever. Some are renewable, like when you plant a new tree when you cut one down. Others are not renewable, like when you dig coal out of the ground. Once it is used, it is gone.
People are aware of the fact that Earth’s natural resources are limited, and can do things to help conserve those resources. When you try to conserve a natural resource, you try to use less of it so it does not get used up so fast. One way that people conserve fuel, like gasoline, is by riding a bicycle or walking when the distance is short instead of driving everywhere.
Water is a very important natural resource because we all need it to stay alive. We can conserve water by making sure that our pipes and faucets do not leak. We can also conserve water by making smart choices, like only using the dishwasher or washing machine when they are full.
Questions:
1. In your own words, what is the main idea of the essay? (5 pts.)
2. Give 5 of your own ways on how you could conserve the natural resources. (5 pts.)
3. Enumerate 5 nouns from the second paragraph.
4. Enumerate 5 verbs from the third paragraph.
5. Find the be verb and helping verb in the third paragraph. (1 answer for each = 2 pts.)
6. Find 3 adjectives in the second paragraph. (3 pts.)
7. If you were asked to rewrite these statements with a coordinating conjunction, which conjunction (FANBOYS) would you use? (2 pts.)

8. If you were asked to rewrite these statements with a coordinating conjunction, which conjunction (FANBOYS) would you use? (2 pts.)

                            13. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</h2><br />

                            21. READING COMPREHENSION
Read the essay below and then answer the questions that follow:
Natural resources are things that we use that come from Earth. Our natural resources are limited. This means that they will not last forever. Some are renewable, like when you plant a new tree when you cut one down. Others are not renewable, like when you dig coal out of the ground. Once it is used, it is gone.
People are aware of the fact that Earth’s natural resources are limited, and can do things to help conserve those resources. When you try to conserve a natural resource, you try to use less of it so it does not get used up so fast. One way that people conserve fuel, like gasoline, is by riding a bicycle or walking when the distance is short instead of driving everywhere.
Water is a very important natural resource because we all need it to stay alive. We can conserve water by making sure that our pipes and faucets do not leak. We can also conserve water by making smart choices, like only using the dishwasher or washing machine when they are full.
Questions:
1. In your own words, what is the main idea of the essay? (5 pts.)
2. Give 5 of your own ways on how you could conserve the natural resources. (5 pts.)
3. Enumerate 5 nouns from the second paragraph.
4. Enumerate 5 verbs from the third paragraph.
5. Find the be verb and helping verb in the third paragraph. (1 answer for each = 2 pts.)
6. Find 3 adjectives in the second paragraph. (3 pts.)
7. If you were asked to rewrite these statements with a coordinating conjunction, which conjunction (FANBOYS) would you use? (2 pts.)
