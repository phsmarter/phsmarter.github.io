                                            Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</a>

                                            Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are.

                                            ANSWER THE FOLLOWING CASE OF MORAL DILEMMAChoose one and explain why1. You are at your best friend's wedding just an hour before the ceremony is to start. Earlier that day, you came across definitive proof that your best friend's spouse-to-be is having an affair with the best man/maid of honor, and you catch them sneaking out of a room together looking disheveled. If you tell your friend about the affair, their day will be ruined, but you don't want them to marry a cheater. What do you do?a.Tell your best friend; sure the day will be ruined, but better a day ruined than an entire life.b..Say nothing; your job is to be supportive and participate in your friend's happiness.2. You are an eyewitness to a crime: A man has robbed a bank, but instead of keeping the money for himself, he donates it to a poor orphanage that can now afford to feed, clothe, and care for its children. You know who committed the crime. If you go to the authorities with the information, there's a good chance the money will be returned to the bank, leaving a lot of kids in need. What do you do?a.Turn the robber in to the authorities; right is right.b..Say nothing since the money went to what you deem a good cause. 3. You're involved in a two-car crash on your way to work one morning in which you accidentally hit and kill a pedestrian. As you get out of the car, you are intercepted by a tearful woman who seems to think that she hit and killed the pedestrian. You're not sure why she thinks she hit the person, but she is convinced. There's only you, the woman, and the person you hit on the road; there are no witnesses. You know that whoever is deemed responsible will probably be sent to jail. What do you do?a.Confess your responsibility; you wouldn't be able to live with the guilt of an innocent person being in jail for a crime you committed.b.Let the woman take the blame; the thought of being locked away from your life and family is too much to bear. 4. Your family is vacationing alone on a private stretch of beach with no lifeguard. Your daughter and your niece, both 7, are best friends and eager to get into the water. You caution them to wait until the water calms some, but they defy you and sneak in anyway. You soon hear screams of distress and find them both caught in a strong current. You are the only swimmer strong enough to save them, but you can only save one at a time. Your niece is a very poor swimmer and likely won't make it much longer. Your daughter is a stronger swimmer, but only has a 50% chance of holding on long enough for you to come back for her. Who do you save first?a.Save your daughter first; you know that your niece will probably die, but you can't bear to lose your child. b.Save your niece first and hope that your daughter can hold on long enough for you to come back for her. 5. You are a doctor at a top hospital. You have six gravely ill patients, five of whom are in urgent need of organ transplants. You can't help them, though, because there are no available organs that can be used to save their lives. The sixth patient, however, will die without a particular medicine. If s/he dies, you will be able to save the other five patients by using the organs of patient 6, who is an organ donor. What do you do?a.Keep patient 6 comfortable, but do not give him the medical care that could save his life in order to save the other five patients. b.Save patient 6 and let the other five die; it's unfortunate, but that's not your call to make.​</a>

                            4. Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well For me it's definitely Ki because even though unarmed and with a bad foot condition his ready to save/, sacrifice himself for his wife.</p><br />

You know who committed the crime. If you go to the authorities with the information, there's a good chance the money will be returned to the bank, leaving a lot of kids in need. What do you do?a.Turn the robber in to the authorities; right is right.b..Say nothing since the money went to what you deem a good cause. 3. You're involved in a two-car crash on your way to work one morning in which you accidentally hit and kill a pedestrian. As you get out of the car, you are intercepted by a tearful woman who seems to think that she hit and killed the pedestrian. You're not sure why she thinks she hit the person, but she is convinced. There's only you, the woman, and the person you hit on the road; there are no witnesses. You know that whoever is deemed responsible will probably be sent to jail. What do you do?a.Confess your responsibility; you wouldn't be able to live with the guilt of an innocent person being in jail for a crime you committed.b.Let the woman take the blame; the thought of being locked away from your life and family is too much to bear. 4. Your family is vacationing alone on a private stretch of beach with no lifeguard. Your daughter and your niece, both 7, are best friends and eager to get into the water. You caution them to wait until the water calms some, but they defy you and sneak in anyway. You soon hear screams of distress and find them both caught in a strong current. You are the only swimmer strong enough to save them, but you can only save one at a time. Your niece is a very poor swimmer and likely won't make it much longer. Your daughter is a stronger swimmer, but only has a 50% chance of holding on long enough for you to come back for her. Who do you save first?a.Save your daughter first; you know that your niece will probably die, but you can't bear to lose your child. b.Save your niece first and hope that your daughter can hold on long enough for you to come back for her. 5. You are a doctor at a top hospital. You have six gravely ill patients, five of whom are in urgent need of organ transplants. You can't help them, though, because there are no available organs that can be used to save their lives. The sixth patient, however, will die without a particular medicine. If s/he dies, you will be able to save the other five patients by using the organs of patient 6, who is an organ donor. What do you do?a.Keep patient 6 comfortable, but do not give him the medical care that could save his life in order to save the other five patients. b.Save patient 6 and let the other five die; it's unfortunate, but that's not your call to make.​</h2><br />
