This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

The minimum wage earners of the National Capital Region are believed to be receiving less than Php500 per day. The CEO of a large supermarket chain in the region is claiming to be paying its contractual higher than the minimum daily wage rate of Php500. To check on this claim, a labor union leader obtained a random sample of 144 contractual employees from this supermarket chain. The survey of their daily wage earnings resulted to an average wage of Php510 per day with standard deviation of Php100. The daily wage of the region is assumed to follow a distribution with an unknown population variance. Perform a test of hypothesis at 5% level of significance to help the labor union leader make an empirical based conclusion on the CEO's claim.​</a>

Americans ages 18 to 29 are considered to be less religious than older Americans. According to recent studies by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, fewer young adults are affiliated with a specific religion than older people today. And, compared with their elders, fewer young people say that religion is very important in their lives. Yet, many young people still believe in traditional religious concepts and practices. Pew Research Center surveys show, for example, that “young adults’ beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven, hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today.” According to GSS (General Social Survey) results from a random sample of 1,679 subjects, 756 in the 18–29 age group pray daily (an increase of 5% over the 1990s), while 55% pray less often. .

However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

Americans ages 18 to 29 are considered to be less religious than older Americans. According to recent studies by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, fewer young adults are affiliated with a specific religion than older people today. And, compared with their elders, fewer young people say that religion is very important in their lives. Yet, many young people still believe in traditional religious concepts and practices. Pew Research Center surveys show, for example, that “young adults’ beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven, hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today.” According to GSS (General Social Survey) results from a random sample of 1,679 subjects, 756 in the 18–29 age group pray daily (an increase of 5% over the 1990s), while 55% pray less often. .
