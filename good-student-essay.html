                                            Your job is to research on the characteristics of a good essay and well-developed paragraph. The task is to compile these and then turn them into a “recipe” for a good essay. Your clients are your fellow students. The challenge is to think of what food would best represent a good essay, and the ingredients and steps involved in making that dish. You will create a recipe booklet for a good essay, and your work needs to follow the format of a recipe, should be well-researched, and creative in order for it to be successful.</a>

                            1. How to be a good student? Essay </h2><br />
                        What is the main characteristic of a good student? A good student must 
have a huge desire and passion to learn and explore something new. 
Everything would indeed seem very easy and enjoyable if we think of 
school as a place for discovering our self as person not as a 
frustrating place where we are always pressured by a tremendous amount 
of work. Furthermore, a good student must be punctual, organized, and 
know how to develop self-discipline. For instance, he or she must always
 come to class and the assignments and projects on time. Developing a 
good time-management and self-discipline is, in fact, a part of 
professional development for students and directly related to their 
success. In addition, a good student must be active and be polite. A 
good student would actively participate in the class discussions and 
would not hesitate to ask questions to his or her teachers. In addition,
 a good student would also always listen to the teachers and never 
interrupt when the teachers are talking or explaining something. Other 
aspects of a good student are honesty and consistency. A good student 
should be academically honest in all aspects of their schoolwork. For 
example, he or she would never cheat on tests or presents the work done 
by others as if it were his or her own (plagiarizes). Lastly, 
consistency is very critical in the process of learning since it helps 
students to achieve their academic goals.<br />             <br /><br />

The internet provides access to a wealth of knowledge and information, allowing students to supplement their studies with additional materials and perspectives. Online learning platforms, such as Coursera or edX, also offer a wide range of courses and programs that students can take to further their education and skills.</p><p></p><p>To become the best student possible, it is important to combine old practices with new ones. By combining traditional methods of studying and completing assignments with the use of technology and online resources, students can stay organized, stay on top of their work, and continue to grow and learn.</p><p></p><br />

                        ❑ ESSAY<p>In the past, being a good student often meant spending long hours studying and memorizing information in order to do well on exams. However, as the world has changed and education has evolved, new practices have emerged that can help students be more successful.</p><p>One of the biggest changes in education has been the shift from a focus on memorization to a focus on critical thinking and problem-solving. In the past, students were often taught to simply regurgitate facts and figures, but today's students need to be able to think critically and apply what they have learned to real-world situations.</p><p>Another important change is the emphasis on collaboration and teamwork. In the past, students were often expected to work independently and compete with each other, but today's students need to be able to work well with others in order to succeed in a globalized, interconnected world.</p><p>Technology has also played a major role in the evolution of education. In the past, students had to rely on books and lectures to learn, but today's students have access to a vast array of online resources and tools that can help them learn more effectively.</p><p>Overall, being a good student today involves a combination of traditional practices, such as studying and doing well on exams, and new practices, such as critical thinking, collaboration, and the use of technology. By embracing these new practices, students can become more successful and better prepared for the challenges of the 21st century.</p>___________________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day</strong><strong>!</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Old practices, such as regularly attending classes, studying hard, and seeking help from teachers when needed, are still essential for students to succeed in school. However, in today's world, there are also many new practices that can help students become good learners.</p><p></p><p>One new practice that can make a good student is actively engaging in the learning process. This means not just passively listening to lectures, but asking questions, participating in discussions, and actively seeking out additional resources to learn more about a subject. This can help students to better understand and retain the material, as well as develop critical thinking skills.</p><p></p><p>Another new practice that can benefit students is the use of technology to enhance their learning. This can include using online resources such as educational videos, online tutoring, and educational games to supplement traditional classroom learning. It can also mean utilizing tools such as study apps and note-taking software to help organize and manage their studies.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, good students in today's world should also be proactive about their own learning. This means setting goals for themselves, creating a plan to achieve those goals, and regularly checking in on their progress. This can help students to stay motivated and on track, and to identify areas where they may need additional help.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while old practices such as hard work and dedication are still important, new practices such as active engagement, the use of technology, and self-directed learning can also play a crucial role in helping students succeed.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps. :)</p><br />

                            14. Describe/depict the characteristics of what you think a good student should beEssay po dpt</h2><br />
                        <p>A good student is the one who can work in a group, motivate others and yield productive output. Being positive, helpful, cooperative and friendly are all the traits of a good student. Such students become great team players and leaders when they grow up. A good student will always be illustrious of his/her attitude, diligence, discipline, mindfulness and self-confidence. Read about the qualities and how these qualities help you to be a good student. A good student is one who reflects on how his/her learning is causing personal change.  Whether that change is in knowledge, attitude, skill-level or behavior, the good student takes time to note how their interaction with the discipline has moved them from where they once stood.</p><p></p><p>All students have the potential to be “good” students; it comes down to choices.  Students who make good choices tend to do better in their academics and extracurricular activities.  These good choices then transfer from their school day to all aspects of their lives.  It all comes down to character and doing what’s right, especially when it’s not easy.  Good students set goals and work hard to follow through to their individual potentials.  Good students seek out help when needed and assist others without hesitation or being asked.  Basically, good students are role models of good choices.</p><p></p><p>I would describe a good student as a student who comes to class and does his or her best on gathering as much information as they can and are willing to help and collaborate with others. They utilize their time wisely in class and understand the importance of time management. A good student will always be on time and present. They will advocate for themselves and others. They will be prepared for class and be resilient in their quest for learning as much as possible instead of just securing the correct answer. The good student will understand the relevance to the purpose of learning new information and make it connect to their lives. They don’t necessarily have to have the highest grade in the class, but having the above-mentioned qualities will certainly lead to academic success.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#BetterWithBrainly</strong></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p></p><br />

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, there are several strategies and techniques that can help you become a good student.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important things you can do to become a good student is to develop good time management skills.

By staying focused and disciplined, you can ensure that you are making the most of your time and achieving your academic goals.</p><p></p><p>Finally, good students tend to be self-motivated and engaged in their learning.
