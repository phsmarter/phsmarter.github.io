This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Most of the silicates occur in the crust because they are the lightest rocks and minerals. Silicates in the mantle try to rise to the top of magma chambers. This magma tends to be full of gases and is the first to rise up and out, especially in volcanoes located over continental crust. They make classic cone-shaped volcanoes. The silicate or granitic magma is also likely recycled through processes such as plate tectonics where crust is melted into the top portion of the mantle</p><br />
