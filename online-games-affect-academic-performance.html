                                            On academic performance The academic performance of a student who was addicted to gaming suffered. Since the student is too engrossed in the game to finish their assignments or prepare for class, they found that gaming addiction has a negative physical impact on academic performance. Others have shown a connection between playing online games and performing worse in school. Even if the respondents play online games, their academic performance is unaffected. Even though they spent time playing, they nevertheless received good grades. Overall, the respondents’ academic performance is strong despite their interest in playing online games, according to the study’s findings. This can be seen as the compromise made when playing video games. There won’t be any points deducted from the student’s grade if they elect not to participate (Dennis O. Dumrique and Jennifer G. Castillo, 2018). According to university of Syracuse reported that being addicted to games may lead to decrease sleep, inference with the demands of society life including socializing and academic work. These online games have a big factor that affects the students in their academic performances in school. According much attention has been directed to the use of online games for learning in the recent years, in part due to the straggering amounts of capital spent on games in the entertainment industry, but also because of their ability to captivate player attention and hold it for lengthy periods of time as players learn to master game complexities and accomplish objectives. pahanap Po ng reference ​please </a>

                            4. On academic performance The academic performance of a student who was addicted to gaming suffered. Since the student is too engrossed in the game to finish their assignments or prepare for class, they found that gaming addiction has a negative physical impact on academic performance. Others have shown a connection between playing online games and performing worse in school. Even if the respondents play online games, their academic performance is unaffected. Even though they spent time playing, they nevertheless received good grades. Overall, the respondents’ academic performance is strong despite their interest in playing online games, according to the study’s findings. This can be seen as the compromise made when playing video games. There won’t be any points deducted from the student’s grade if they elect not to participate (Dennis O. Dumrique and Jennifer G. Castillo, 2018). According to university of Syracuse reported that being addicted to games may lead to decrease sleep, inference with the demands of society life including socializing and academic work. These online games have a big factor that affects the students in their academic performances in school. According much attention has been directed to the use of online games for learning in the recent years, in part due to the straggering amounts of capital spent on games in the entertainment industry, but also because of their ability to captivate player attention and hold it for lengthy periods of time as players learn to master game complexities and accomplish objectives. pahanap Po ng reference ​please </h2><br />

To investigate how playing mobile games affects the academic performance of Grade 11 GAS students in PBNHS, you can collect data on the students' academic performance (e.g., grades, test scores) and compare it to their self-reported frequency and duration of mobile game use. You can also ask the students' teachers for their observations on the students' academic performance and behavior in class.</p><p></p><p>3. To identify the common reasons why students engage in playing mobile games, you can conduct interviews or focus groups with students and ask them about their motivations for playing mobile games. You can also ask them about the types of games they play and how often they play them.</p><p></p><p>4. To propose possible ways to enhance students' teamwork and improve their activeness in school, you can review the literature on effective strategies for promoting teamwork and active participation in the classroom. You can also gather input from teachers and students on what they believe would be effective strategies for promoting these behaviors.</p><p></p><p>5.

Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and Thelr Effects on Academic Performance Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concem that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems. Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction. In general, IGD has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions. However, a study conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denotes a disparity on the result of academic performance between IGD and mobile phone addiction. Cyberbullying, on the other hand, is also an ethical concern that has affected several adolescents and adults. Previous studies on traditional bullying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students. Both cyberbullying and mobile game addiction (constructs) were neglected as causal factors for the students' academic performance. (Favito, B. et al., 2018) 1.

The hypothesis also proposes a possible explanation for this relationship, namely that online games may be distracting and negatively impact time management skills, which in turn affects a student's ability to participate actively in class.</p><p></p><p>To test this hypothesis, researchers could conduct a study that compares the academic performance and class participation of students who play online games regularly with those who do not. The study could also include additional variables, such as the amount of time spent playing online games, to further explore the relationship between online gaming and academic performance.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Because the children or students playing online games will get addicted more, they have a chance to not participate in class participation or they will feel lazy because in their head, they want to play online games.
