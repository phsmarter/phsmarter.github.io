                                            True or False Practical research
1. Research Happens in just one field of knowledge.
2. One advantage of qualitative research is that it involves a lot of research's subjectivity in data analysis.
3. The mixed method of research happens only in a quantitative research
4. Nursing in one example of hard sciences.
5. The purpose of research is to learn how to work scientifically and systematically
6. One purpose of doing research is not to improve your reading and writing skills.
7.All research types apply to all data collecting techniques
8. Sticking to one data collection technique is the best research method.
9. Subjectivity and objectivity are inseparable
10. Quantitative research tends to be more objective that subjective.
11. Biology and Chemistry are hard science.
12. The mixed methid of research happens only in quantitative research.
13.It is necessary for the qualitative researcher to conduct his or her research in a laboratory.
14. Qualitative research promotes a full understanding of human behaviour or personality traits in their natural setting.
15. Quantitative research requires non-numerical data, which means that the research uses words rather that numbers in to express the results.

Providing there was sufficient rigour in setting up the hypothesis and getting the results then the results are valid. Because a simple example would be taking samples from people for medical diagnosis and carrying out some other tests on some biological markers.​</a>

Gaining access into a prison to study the social and cultural norms of inmates would be more difficult is an example of a closed setting. 4. A covert study is potentially more ethical because it allows the group to make an informed decision on whether they consent to the researcher or not. 5. Overt ethnography refers to an ethnographer who does not disclose that they're studying the group, so the researcher may provide a different explanation for being there.​</a>

                            15. Is a research still valid even when the instruments was implemented unethically? Why?Answer:The validity of experimental results does not in general depend on the ethical nature of the enquiry. Providing there was sufficient rigour in setting up the hypothesis and getting the results then the results are valid. Because a simple example would be taking samples from people for medical diagnosis and carrying out some other tests on some biological markers.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Experimental results are not validated by the ethics surrounding the topic at hand. The validity of a research depends on the <strong>accuracy, rigor and preciseness of the implementation</strong>. While ethical considerations are important when planning a research, unethical implementation does not necessarily mean that the results are invalid. In the past, unethical experiments have been conducted on certain members of the population, but we still use the information from these studies since they are accurate.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST   </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Do you want to learn more about validity in research?
