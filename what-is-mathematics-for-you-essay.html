The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane? Explain your answer.________________________WORKSHEET NO.2DIRECTIONS: Classify whether the following professions/occupations are related to physical er biologicalscience.1. Doctor2. Engineer3.

                            2. What did you realize about Mathematics? Essay.</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p><p>One realization that many people have is that mathematics is a way to describe and understand the patterns and structures that exist in the world around us. From simple concepts like counting and measuring, to more advanced ideas like algebra and geometry, mathematics provides a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of everything from numbers and shapes, to the movements of the planets and the stock market.</p><p></p><p>Another realization that people often have is that mathematics requires precision and attention to detail. In mathematics, small errors can lead to large discrepancies, so it is important to be careful and thorough when solving problems. This focus on precision can also help to develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills, which can be applied to other areas of life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, many people realize that mathematics is a subject that can be both challenging and rewarding.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mathematics is literally everywhere in the modern world, but probably in a different way gab it has previously. As we are living in the technological age, most of the mathematics can be automated for you but it’s still happening in the form of computer programs and calculators. The people that create these programs all need to tell the machines how to perform the math so those people use it all the time. Anyone who works in a bank or invests in any way utilizes numbers daily. All new technology that comes out, weather it be self driving cars, drones, smart phones etc are require a mathematics approach in order to get all of these things to work. So while you might not need math folding clothes at target or cooking a burger, there are more jobs now than ever that are utilizing advanced mathematics and mathematical concepts in their every day lives</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>I searched it this what i found i hope it still helps! </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1,The most important stage of the teaching cycle is the assessment stage. Assessment provides teachers with the opportunity to evaluate the learning outcomes of their students and identify areas of strengths and weaknesses. It is through assessment that teachers can make informed decisions on how to improve their teaching practice and design instructional strategies that better suit the needs of their learners. Assessment also helps teachers to adjust their teaching methods to cater for individual differences and to ensure that their learners are progressing towards the learning goals.</p><p></p><p>2,The best teaching strategy to be used in the intermediate grades with special needs is differentiated instruction. This strategy involves tailoring teaching methods and materials to suit the individual learning needs and preferences of students. In this approach, the teacher provides multiple ways for students to access the curriculum and encourages them to work at their own pace. Differentiated instruction also involves using a variety of teaching methods such as visual aids, cooperative learning, and hands-on activities to engage learners.</p><p></p><p>3,To apply constructivism in teaching mathematics, teachers should adopt a student-centered approach to learning. They should encourage students to actively participate in their learning by providing them with opportunities to explore mathematical concepts, ask questions, and share their ideas with others. Teachers should also use real-world examples and scenarios to make the learning more relevant and engaging for students. Furthermore, teachers should encourage students to work collaboratively, providing them with opportunities to discuss and solve problems together.</p><p></p><p>4,One of the possible challenges in using constructivism in teaching mathematics is the need for careful planning and preparation. Teachers must design activities and lessons that allow students to explore and construct their own knowledge while ensuring that the learning outcomes are aligned with the curriculum goals. Another challenge is managing the different learning needs and preferences of students in a constructivist classroom. Teachers must be able to adapt their teaching methods to cater for individual differences and provide support and scaffolding when needed.</p><p></p><p>5,Mathematics anxiety is a psychological condition that affects a person's ability to learn and perform mathematical tasks. It can be caused by a number of factors, including negative experiences in math class, a lack of confidence in one's ability, and a fear of failure. During a mathematics anxiety episode, students may view math as a difficult subject, their math class as a place of fear and anxiety, and their math teacher as someone who may judge or criticize them. It is important for teachers to create a supportive and positive learning environment that encourages students to take risks and make mistakes without fear of judgment or criticism.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>it depends on the individual mathematician and their particular area of expertise.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I believe the most important stage of the teaching cycle is the assessment stage. Assessment is essential in determining whether the desired learning objectives have been achieved. Assessment helps teachers understand learning better and gain insight on how to improve the student’s experience and the learning environment. Assessment also encourages student feedback, which can provide valuable information on how to further refine the teaching process. This stage allows teachers to measure success, track student progress and make necessary adjustments to ensure the students are reaching their full potential.</p><p></p><p>2. The best teaching strategy to be used in the intermediate grades with special needs is one that emphasizes positive reinforcement and gives students an opportunity to practice their new skills. Teachers should use a variety of teaching methods, such as scaffolding, small group activities, and differentiated instruction, to ensure that all students receive an appropriate level of challenge and support. It is important to provide the students with frequent and timely feedback so they can immediately track their progress and understand where they are in terms of meeting the desired learning objectives. Additionally, teachers should consciously create a learner-centered atmosphere that values and respects each student’s individual needs.</p><p></p><p>3. To apply constructivism in teaching mathematics, teachers should create a learning environment that allows students to explore and discover mathematical principles. Constructivist teaching methods such as inquiry-based learning should be employed in order to engage the students in problem-solving activities. For example, teachers can start with a problem or an issue, and then allow the students to discuss the various options and create solutions in order to reach a common goal. Additionally, teachers should create activities in which students can make mistakes and receive feedback, which is essential to constructivist learning and encourages collaboration and communication.</p><p></p><p>4. The biggest challenge in using constructivism when teaching mathematics is getting students to be actively involved in the learning process and move away from being passive recipients of knowledge. Additionally, students may feel overwhelmed by the more open-ended nature of constructivist teaching and the associated lack of structure and guidance. Furthermore, since constructivist teaching necessitates that students work through problems on their own and in groups, there are potential difficulties when different students are operating at different levels.</p><p></p><p>5. I have not personally experienced mathematics anxiety, but I know many people who have. From my experience, those who had mathematics anxiety typically viewed math class as a chore, and their teacher as somebody who did not really understand them or their difficulties. They felt intimidated by the subject and believed that they were not capable of achieving success. They often preferred to avoid math class or simply go through the motions to avoid the anxiety associated with the subject. Thankfully, most of those I know have been able to overcome the anxiety with the help of supportive peers and teachers.</p><strong>Answer:</strong><p>The teaching cycle is an essential process in ensuring effective learning in any classroom. However, among all the stages in the teaching cycle, I believe that the <strong>planning stage is the most important</strong>. Planning helps teachers establish clear objectives, develop effective teaching strategies, and choose appropriate assessment methods that will ensure students' success. Without proper planning, teachers may lose track of their goals and may fail to meet the specific needs of their students.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to teaching intermediate grades with special needs, <strong>the most effective strategy is differentiated instruction</strong>. Differentiated instruction is a teaching approach that caters to the diverse learning needs of students. This strategy involves tailoring the curriculum to meet individual needs, learning styles, and interests. It also includes using a variety of instructional methods and materials, such as technology, manipulatives, and cooperative learning, to help students succeed.</p><p></p><p>Constructivism is a teaching approach that emphasizes the active involvement of learners in the learning process. <strong>To apply constructivism in teaching mathematics, teachers should encourage students to engage in problem-solving activities</strong> that will allow them to discover concepts and apply them in real-world situations. Teachers should also provide opportunities for group work, peer-to-peer teaching, and reflection to help students construct their knowledge actively.</p><p></p><p>Despite the benefits of constructivism, there are possible challenges that teachers may face when implementing this approach. <strong>One of the significant challenges is the need for careful planning and preparation</strong>. Teachers may need to spend more time designing activities, selecting appropriate materials, and adapting them to meet students' needs. Another challenge is the need for constant assessment and feedback to ensure that students construct accurate knowledge and avoid misconceptions.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mathematics anxiety is a common experience among students</strong>, and it can be challenging to overcome. When I had mathematics anxiety, I viewed math as a difficult and boring subject. I saw math class as a place where I would struggle and fail. My math teacher's teaching style was not engaging, and I found it difficult to connect with the subject matter. To overcome my anxiety, I had to change my mindset and focus on the practical application of math in my daily life. I also sought help from my teacher and peers and engaged in activities that made math fun and enjoyable.</p><p></p><p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, effective teaching requires careful planning, differentiation, and active engagement of learners. Teachers should apply constructivist principles in their teaching, but they should also be aware of the possible challenges that come with this approach. Finally, addressing mathematics anxiety requires a shift in mindset and a focus on practical application and enjoyable activities.</p><br />

                        <p>Man has been using discrete mathematics for centuries. Discrete math is a mainstay in modern man's daily activities. Our school systems begin teaching the concepts to the children as early as possible. So what is discrete math, where does it come from and how is it used. This project will provide insight into the topic of discrete mathematics. Discrete Mathematics usage has been growing. It deals with problem solving techniques that either use finite or discontinuous quantities.vThink of an escalator, when the stairs are up fro walking then we are referring to finite but it the escalator is laid flat like a slide it seems Basically, discrete mathematics deals with the finite. Discrete math is a methodology for dealing with discrete incidents and finite processes. In calculus, mathematicians work with functions and infinite limits. Discrete math covers topics like matrices, finite probability, difference equations and graph theory. With all those being mentioned, however, the true power of discrete mathematics is algorithmic problem solving or solving problems by creating and analyzing algorithms that build a solution. "The difficulty is that discrete mathematics is an inclusive term; it embraces several topical areas of mathematics, some of which go back to early stages of mathematical development while others are more recent additions to the discipline." </p><p>sorry gusto ko lang po ng points</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The big one for me is that math is as much about finding useful or interesting as it is about finding true. Little proving steps can get you from true thing to true thing (bring right is relatively easy so long as you're not picky about what you're right about) but steering your walk across the true stuff to something interesting (often a particular interesting thing you suspect is also true) is the hard part.</strong></p><p></p><br />
