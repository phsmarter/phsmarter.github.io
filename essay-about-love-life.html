LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Love Life Essay<p>          Love is an emotion that we all yearn for. Right from the day we are born we crave love. Little babies who just enter this world are unaware about what goes on around here. If there is one thing that they understand, it is love. They understand nothing else but love and crave for it. They long to be with their parents and grandparents as they can feel the love and warmth by their touch and behaviour. They hesitate and cry when a stranger picks them as the love quotient is lower or at times not there at all.</p><p></p><p>          The mother-child relationship is said to be the strongest. The sole reason for it is love. There is immense love involved. The mother loves the child selflessly and the later reciprocates this love. As we grow up, we make friends, are introduced to teachers, relatives, neighbours and many other people. What is it that draws or repels us from a person? It is his nature. A person with a kind and loving nature is loved by all.</p><p></p><p>          For instance, a teacher who is loving and supporting is loved by the students while one who is harsh is not liked by anyone. Similarly, we love those relatives who love us and treat us nicely. We look forward to meet them and feel happy in their company.</p><p></p><p>          Thus, love is the basis of every relationship. A place where people love each other is peaceful and beautiful.</p><p></p><p><strong>HopeItHelps</strong></p><p><strong>CarrOnLearning</strong></p><p><strong>Goodluck</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            2. essay about “Love and Life, their Connections and Differences”​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love and life are two concepts that are closely intertwined, yet distinct in their own ways. On one hand, love is a powerful emotion that can bring people together, create bonds, and bring happiness to our lives. It can take many forms, such as romantic love, familial love, and platonic love. On the other hand, life is the existence that we all share, the experience of living and growing, and the journey we undertake every day.</p><p></p><p>The connection between love and life is obvious. Love is an essential part of life and can bring meaning and purpose to our existence. Love can be a source of joy, comfort, and support in times of need. It can also inspire us to strive for greater things and help us to overcome life's difficulties.</p><p></p><p>However, while love is a positive force in our lives, it is not always easy. Love can be complicated and can bring its own set of challenges, such as jealousy, betrayal, and heartache. This contrast shows the differences between love and life: love is a subject to change and life is a constant.</p><p></p><p>Another difference between love and life is that love often involves sacrifice and compromise, while life is about self-preservation and self-care. When we love someone, we put their needs before our own and are willing to make sacrifices for them. But in life, we have to be careful not to neglect our own needs in the process of taking care of others.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, love and life are two concepts that are connected yet different. Love brings meaning and purpose to our lives, but it also brings its own set of challenges. Life is the experience of living and growing, and it is essential to find balance and harmony between love and life. It is important to take care of oneself, to nurture healthy relationships and to keep in mind that love is a journey and not a destination</p><br />

                        <p>Yan Po ba tanong </p><p>family Po  thank you po</p>“FRIENDSHIP”<br /><br />Friends can be of the same or different age, origin, community, even species. The emotional and psychological bond we develop with our friends is called ‘friendship.’ Friendship is a bond that exists beyond greediness and jealousy.<br />Earlier households had larger family member count, and the seed of friendship sown in the children was soon after their birth. Almost the same age, family members became friends as they engaged in similar activities. But nowadays, families are mostly small, and households with only one child often suffer from loneliness and social anxiety.<br />

For you to be able to apply the biographical context of Steven Paul Job, try to read another story written by him.
LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love is a set of emotions and behaviors characterized by intimacy, passion, and commitment. It involves care, closeness, protectiveness, attraction, affection, and trust. Love can vary in intensity and can change over time.</p><p></p><p>Love is when you choose to be at your best when the other person is not at their best. Love is when what you want is never important. But what the other person needs and wants is always paramount. If you truly love someone, both of these definitions will ring true.</p><p></p><p>The main concept of love is very crucial and important for everybody's life. Love is all about affection, care, and protection kind of emotion; someone feels about another person. The word love is hard to define as it involves many emotions, but this is a strong feeling for everybody.</p><p></p><p>Love remains critically important throughout human existence but it changes from those early, heady days of passion and almost drug-induced intensity to something more enduring and long-lasting. Love is powerful because it transforms and evolves throughout the course of relationships and the journey of human life.</p><p></p><p>Scientific studies have shown that being in love causes our body to release feel-good hormones and neuro-chemicals that trigger specific, positive reactions.</p><p></p><p>Real love is about giving and contributing to your partner's life. A man who loves you will give to you in the best ways he knows how. He will care for you, respect you, listen to you, and adore you. He won't drain your energy or make you feel like giving is only one sided.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning </strong></p><br />
