                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>My own idea of a hero is that someone who willingly sacrifice themselves for the safety of people. An individual can be a hero by helping others even if they will struggle as well, and also providing their needs even though they don't have much. My hero can be anyone. But I consider my parents as a Hero of my life.José Rizal is regarded as one of the Philippines' most illustrious individuals. He was a versatile intellectual and political activist most remembered for his political writings, which sparked the Philippine revolution and eventually led to his execution by Spanish invaders. Rizal was also a physician who studied ophthalmology with Louis de Wecker and Otto Becker, two well-known European ophthalmologists. Jose Rizal became a national hero in the Philippines because he battled for freedom in a quiet but effective manner. He was the most multi-talented individual who has ever lived. Rizal battled by writing, which enlightened a large number of Filipinos. Nobility and Dignity are two words that come to mind while thinking about nobility and Rizal's approaches were what set him different from the rest.<br />

Mobiles are useful, however. They enable parents to maintain contact with their children whenever they need to. There are also obvious benefits to their use in emergency situations. The recent rise in crimes associated with mobiles is a worrying trend: many of our children are under threat of violence merely by the possession of a phone.

                            30. While helping your classmates, you have noticed your closest friend not working on the assigned task. When you asked him about it, he said that he could not see how the output you are working on can bring change in the environment. Having learned the importance of small consistent efforts and their impact on the greater scheme of things from the essay Green at Heart, identify three points on how literature can indeed help inform people about the need to work cooperatively and responsibly for our environment and share these points with your closest friend. (make 1 or more paragraph)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>           Literature's contribution to cooperation and environmental responsibility shouldn't be underestimated.</p><p>A single reason alone as to why it's essential to the topic will suffice. The three points mainly consist of 1, The power of information-consumption about a worldwide issue. It will give people more clarity to how we as a population can help maintain and improve our environment through ways so simple! 2, The surprising amount of unconcerned and unconscious people towards their enivronmentally harmful actions without realizing it! By providing them helpful information, they can reformulate their actions to be more cooperative and responsible when it comes to the environment. And 3, Literature can reach people of any standing, place, and belief. Regardless of their lives, we all live in ONE planet where our environment is at risk. People across the world can contribute and cooperate with each other to do our responsibility towards our environment. Therefore, based on the given examples, Literature can reach broad horizons to contribute its share of responsibility towards our environment.</p><br />
