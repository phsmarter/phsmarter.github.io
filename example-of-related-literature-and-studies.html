                                            Directions: Read and analyze the different ways on how to organize the review of related literature and studies in your self-learning module 4, pages 23 to 26. Identify which method has been applied in the given statement/s. 1. The literature review focuses on the method used by the graduating SHS students to raise funds for their entrepreneurship proposal. 2. This indicates the method used by the STEM students in their study on the preservation of our nature using the innovation brought by technology. 3. A review organized in this manner would shift between time periods within each section according to the point made. 4. By this approach of organizing related literatures, major arguments or contrasting differences are grouped according to the authors' agreement or disagreement in their approaches and ideas. 5. In this organization, coherence of author's view on specific issues from one author to another is vividly followed. 6. In this approach, related literatures and studies are organized according to the authors' popularity and fame. 7. Considered as the easiest way of writing related literatures and studies, this approach features how the topic is changed according to year or time. 8. An example of this is writing the main topic in a deductive manner: the trend of teenage pregnancy globally down to the author's locality. 9. Another approach in writing coherent and organized review of related literature and studies is by arranging it according to the development of significant theories. 10. In this manner, materials were written earlier should be cited first before those which were written later.​</a>

If your topic reaches across disciplines, consider reviewing studies from each discipline separately. Because some topics naturally transcend discipline boundaries. G8. If your review is long and complex, you should briefly summarize the main threads of your argument, then present your conclusion. Example presents a brief summary and conclusion section that appeared at the end of long literature review. This is actually the synthesis of the review of the related literature and addresses your research questions. G9. Check the flow of your argument for coherence. One of the most difficult skills to learn in academic writing is to evaluate one's own writing for coherence. And coherence refers to how well a manuscript holds together as a unified document.​</a>

                            10. Directions: Read and analyze the different ways on how to organize the review of related literature and studies in your self-learning module 4, pages 23 to 26. Identify which method has been applied in the given statement/s. 1. The literature review focuses on the method used by the graduating SHS students to raise funds for their entrepreneurship proposal. 2. This indicates the method used by the STEM students in their study on the preservation of our nature using the innovation brought by technology. 3. A review organized in this manner would shift between time periods within each section according to the point made. 4. By this approach of organizing related literatures, major arguments or contrasting differences are grouped according to the authors' agreement or disagreement in their approaches and ideas. 5. In this organization, coherence of author's view on specific issues from one author to another is vividly followed. 6. In this approach, related literatures and studies are organized according to the authors' popularity and fame. 7. Considered as the easiest way of writing related literatures and studies, this approach features how the topic is changed according to year or time. 8. An example of this is writing the main topic in a deductive manner: the trend of teenage pregnancy globally down to the author's locality. 9. Another approach in writing coherent and organized review of related literature and studies is by arranging it according to the development of significant theories. 10. In this manner, materials were written earlier should be cited first before those which were written later.​</h2><br />

                            12. please can you explain this topic . i needed huhu G7. G8. G9.G7. If your topic reaches across disciplines, consider reviewing studies from each discipline separately. Because some topics naturally transcend discipline boundaries. G8. If your review is long and complex, you should briefly summarize the main threads of your argument, then present your conclusion. Example presents a brief summary and conclusion section that appeared at the end of long literature review. This is actually the synthesis of the review of the related literature and addresses your research questions. G9. Check the flow of your argument for coherence. One of the most difficult skills to learn in academic writing is to evaluate one's own writing for coherence. And coherence refers to how well a manuscript holds together as a unified document.​</h2><br />

In that case, it's important to review research from each field separately.
