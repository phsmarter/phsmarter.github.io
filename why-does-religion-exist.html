                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.

                            5. Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong> <strong>Religion was able to help explain man's existence and role in the world by way of introducing the supreme being who is God. If religion was not able to introduce God to men, men would be living without knowing how and why they exist in the world.</strong></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Jewish tradition states that he was the first to actively spread belief in One God; and it is in his merit that Jews continue to exist (Genesis 18:19, and ch. 17). Abraham became the first to advance the idea of ethical monotheism: the worship of One God, and the appropriate ethical code of conduct.</strong></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Whether it is religion or other beliefs, we are influenced by the cultures and regions we are from. </strong><strong>Geography does not only affect where particular religions or belief systems, such as the world's major faiths, are located but it can affect how specific beliefs are practiced and behaviors that it </strong><strong>encourages.</strong></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Yes. Religious conflicts can be avoided by understanding and compassion. ... If people learn to understand that there are certain differences in religious practices and focus on the fact that we all believe in a greater being like God, religious conflicts can be avoided and resolved.</strong></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>People in various religious traditions, such as </strong><strong>Christianity </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>other</strong><strong> </strong><strong>religions</strong><strong>, may derive ideas of right and wrong from the rules and laws set forth in their respective authoritative guides and by their religious leaders.

It is good that religion is uniting these people, but they are still only being united with other people who believe in the same religion. People will only go to their own place of worship and the different religions will still be divided. ... Religion tends to divide people more than it unites people.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. As a christian believer who accept Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior, yes I do believe that God really exist. But some people do not believe that God exist because they are people who don't know God, the people who don't have faith. John 3:16 "For God so love the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life". </p><p>2. Religions, such as Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, have often been proclaimed by their believers as a unifying force, one that transcends gender, race and physical borders. However, these religions have also been seen to be the case of conflict and divisions around the world. Religion ideally serves several functions. It gives meaning and purpose to life, reinforces social unity and stability, serves as an agent of social control, promotes psychological and physical well-being, and may motivate people to work for positive social change.</p><p>3. Definitely yes, it helps us to be a good and a better person. It also helps us to  grow, not only physically, but also mentally and spiritually. Religion can also give people a sense of purpose. It can affect them by making them want to dedicate their lives to accomplishing some sort of good in the world.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>this is no. 1 I'll comment the rest in the comments section</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I don’t know enough about Japan and Shinto, but in China, Taoism developed first as a philosophy and so too did Confucian thinking. The feudal states before China united used Confucian ideals in running themselves bureaucratically. This was from roughly 500 BCE until around 220 BCE. In the Han Dynasty that followed on from around 200 BCE, Taoism developed into a religion and Confucianism was by then the art of governance. Taoism has remained popular since as has Confucianism.</p><br />

what is your opinion about samsara or the process f rebirth as an individual?
plss answer that question.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. how do you understand the phrase existence is painful? </p><p>For me, the phrase "Existence is painful" means that being alive is equivalent to having problems that are yet to come and that some individuals couldn't bother getting hurt physically or mentally which is why living or existing is painful.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. what is your opinion about samsara or the process of rebirth as an individual?</p><p>My opinion about the samsara is that it is happening because we are given a chance to change all our mistakes but the catch is that you wouldn't come back in past as the same person, but in the future as a different individual.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. how does karma affect the process of rebirth or samsara?</p><p>Karma affects the process of rebirth by following someone to their next life causing this person to have bad luck.  </p><p>
</p><p>4. between the two which cultural religion do you prefer? why?</p><p>I prefer the cultural religion of Hindus for they believe in gods. In my opinion, it is much better to believe in many gods and seek them than believe in one (1) god but not believe there is a necessity to seek god</p><p>
</p><p>5. differentiate Hinduism and Buddhism in terms of how they work as a religion. </p><p>Hindus worship numerous deities. Even though there are many gods in Hinduism, they are believed to all come from Brahman, the universal soul. On the other hand, Buddhists deny the existence of many gods. Instead, they believe in the existence of one god, but they do not believe it is necessary to seek god.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>6. why is karma plays an important role in Buddhism?</p><p>For Buddhists, karma has implications beyond this life. Bad actions in a previous life can follow a person into their next life and cause bad luck to that person.</p><p>

Later, God told Abraham in prophecy to move to the Holy Land, which is where he raised his family.<p></p>7.Confucianism deals with social matters, while Taoism concerns itself with the search for meaning. They share common beliefs about man, society, and the universe, although these notions were around long before either philosophy. Both began as philosophies, each later taking on religious overtones.<p></p>8.Whether it is religion or other beliefs, we are influenced by the cultures and regions we are from. ... Geography does not only affect where particular religions or belief systems, such as the world's major faiths, are located but it can affect how specific beliefs are practiced and behaviors that it encourages.<p></p>9.Eastern religions are about the individual, and are selfless, they do not need to seek your participation, while Abrahamic religions are all about the religion, are selfish, jealous and vindictive, and that you must follow their rules and commands.<p></p>10.In one when religion and politics both unite with each other in an attempt to monopolize political power.

It was named as Passover (Pesach) every 14th of Nisan. This is always the biggest festival from that ancient until in this modern time in Israel and other part of the world wherein they have Jews.<p></p>13.Instead, Israeli Jews are much more neatly grouped into four informal categories of Jewish religious identity – Haredi (ultra-Orthodox), Dati (religious), Masorti (traditional) and Hiloni (secular). Virtually all Jews in Israel say one of these terms describes their religious category.<p></p>14.Most of us know a few historical facts about the period of the Holocaust. We know, for example, that roughly 11.5 million people were either murdered, starved to death, or died due to inhumane conditions leading to life taking diseases, of which 6 million were Jews. We know that you didn't have to be "old" to be murdered because 1.5 million of those that died were little children.<p></p>EXPLANATION <p>HEART THIS PO HOPE IT'S HELP KUA </p><p>(GOOD MORNING)</p><br />
