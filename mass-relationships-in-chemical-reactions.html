D B E +F 38-43. Situation Analysis. Read the selection about chemical reaction and its indicators below and answer the set of questions by determining the indication of chemical reaction involved in the scenario. Chemical reactions must be distinguished from physical changes. Physical changes include changes of state, such as ice melting to water and water evaporating to vapor. If a physical change occurs, the physical properties of a substance will change, but its chemical identity will remain the same. Below are situations in which a chemical reaction occurred. Determine whether what indication of chemical reaction each situation manifests: E. release or gain of energy F. change in odor A. color change C. evolution of heat, light, and sound D. production of gas B. formation of precipitate 38. When iron is exposed to air and moisture, rust formation takes place. Rust is nothing but Iron Oxide; a new substance formed out of the reaction. 39. Fireworks are the result of chemical reactions involving a few key components - like a fuel source (often charcoal-based black powder), an oxidizer (compounds like nitrates, chlorates that produce oxygen) and a color-producing chemical mixture. 40. When an antacid is dropped into a glass of water, there will be formation of bubbles that you observe rising from the bottom of the glass. 41. Energy is absorbed during chemical changes involved in cooking, like baking a cake. 42. It only takes one experience with a rotten egg to learn that they smell different that fresh eggs.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A covalent bond is the strong electrostatic force of attraction between two positively charged nuclei and the shared pair of electrons between them. Of course there can be more than one shared pair of electrons between two atoms, hence why there are double bonds (two shared pairs of electrons) and triple bonds (three shared pairs of electrons). Triple bonds are stronger than double bonds, which are stronger than single bonds. A single bond consists of a strong sigma bond. A double bond consists of a sigma bond (good head on overlap between two s orbitals) and a pi bond (poor sideways overlap between two p orbitals, thus this bond is weaker than a sigma bond). Covalent bonds form between two non metal atoms of similar electronegativities and are the strongest type of bond in chemistry.<br /><br />Molecules consist of at least two atoms joined together by a covalent bond. Molecules can consist of atoms of a single element (e.g. diatomic molecules such as O2) or atoms of many different elements (e.g. glucose, which consists of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms joined together by covalent bonds, or a polyatomic ion such as NH4+). Therefore, molecules can consist of two atoms or many atoms joined together by one or more covalent bonds.<br />Ionic compounds are compounds composed of ions, charged particles that form when an atom (or group of atoms) gains or loses electrons. (A cation is a positively charged ion; an anion is a negatively charged ion.) Covalent or molecular compounds form when elements share electrons in a covalent bond to form molecules.<br />Atomic weight is measured in atomic mass units (amu), also called daltons. See below for a list of chemical elements and their atomic weights. ... measured in terms of the atomic mass unit, which is defined to be 1/12 of the mass of an atom of carbon-12, or 1.660538921 × 10−24 gram.<br />Amedeo Avogadro- Is an Italian scientist whose work led to the determination of this value (6.02214179 x 1023)<br />We're being asked to determine the branch of chemistry that deals with the mass relationships of elements in compounds and the mass relationships among reactants and products in chemical reactions.

Therefore, the answer is d. stoichiometry.<br />The molar mass of a substance is the mass in grams of one mole of that substance. This mass is given by the atomic weight of the chemical unit that makes up that substance in atomic mass units (amu). For example, silver has an atomic weight of 107.8682 amu, so one mole of silver has a mass of 107.8682 grams.<br />The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly 6.022 140 76 x 1023 elementary entities.
