                                            A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</a>

If the writer deals effectively with each of these, the result will be an essay that expresses the writer's thinking in an effective, interesting, and organized manner.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>          In addition to being free of grammar and spelling errors, a good essay will have a strong central argument or purpose that it progressively develops. In a literary essay, this central argument is known as a thesis. A good essay introduces its thesis in the opening paragraph, and the following paragraphs are well developed. Each body paragraph should stay focused on one specific topic, which should be introduced by a topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph. The paragraphs should also flow in a logical order so that they build on each other and reach a strong conclusion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>          The word "essay " comes from the French word meaning "to try," so an essay is an attempt to be interesting and fresh.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I HOPE THIS HELPS---</p>PA BRAINLIEST ANSWER PO<p>SALAMAT</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:<br /><br />There are many different qualities people believe a president should have. These qualities make up whether a president was considered a good leader...or a mediocre one. In my opinion, a good president should be open to listening to their citizens and have the appropriate qualifications. If a president listens to their citizens, that means that they are intimate with the knowledge of the country's economic status, how its citizens feel, and what appropriate actions should be taken. Along with that, since a president is in charge of many things (the military, the economy, etc), I believe that a good president should actually know what they are doing, and whether it will be good for the overall well-being of their country and citizens.</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>If I could have any superpower, I would have the ability to read minds. For example, it would be amazing to know what people were thinking inside their heads. Being able to know what people are thinking will make you more socially aware. You will then have the capacity to know what people think of what you are doing, making you less annoying. This can only be achieved through mind reading capabilities. Also, the capacity to extract answer for different tasks, like taking a test, would be available. I could ask for help on said test and while the teacher works it out to be able to better provide their help, I would have read their mind and received the answer to the question. This would be beneficial as you would never have to study for a test again while still receiving good marks. On top of that list of reasons, mind reading capabilities could be used in espionage, opening up a whole new set of career opportunities in the private and public sectors. This gives more opportunities to earn legal tender as well as enhancing your resume. In short, the ability to read minds would be a great addition to your repertoire of of abilities and will benefit you in all walks of life. Also, it would be a lot of fun.</p><br />

Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Topic:</p><p><strong>Environmental Pollution</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and Cancer Choice</strong></p><p></p><p>Environmental pollution in the recent days has been a major contributor to the increment of fatal health effects in the society. Environmental pollutants are toxins from air, food and water that have led to the development of severe diseases like asthma, pneumonia, and cancer. Environmental pollution is majorly contributed by humans who are leading bad lifestyles through carrying out of dangerous activities on the environment. Therefore, the unethical behavior of human beings contributes to pollution of the environment and eventually increment of cancer-related defects. Over time, environmental pollution has been connected to various types of cancer. The common pollutions that are associated with cancer include; food pollution as a result of the carcinogenic contaminants present in food additives, outdoor and indoor air pollutions as a result of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and smoke, Cosmetics, Drugs, and the increment of carcinogenic metals on the environment[1].</p><p></p><p>The continuous release of dangerous fumes from industries to the environment increases the PAHs thereby increasing the risk of people developing cancer, more particularly lung cancer. These PAHs exist in the form of fine particles of carbon that enters into the human bodies mainly through the natural process of breathing. In addition, volatile organic elements and excessive use of pesticides on the environment increase the chances of people developing the brain, germ cell and wilm’s tumors in the body[2]. The exposure of people to these PAHs over a long period in various cities has dramatically increased cancer deaths.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the release of harmful fumes into the atmosphere has destroyed the ozone layer that handles absorbing dangerous ultraviolet rays from the sun. People are now exposed to these dangerous rays on the environment leading to the development of skin cancer. Therefore, cancer is a disease that has been contributed as a result of unethical activities by people on the environment. People should rather maintain high ethical standards in their day to day endeavors in case cancer issues will be minimized.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the exposure of people to the chlorinated water meant for drinking over a long period can be associated with the development of cancer complications. The nitrate compounds that are contained in this water are transformed into mutagenic N-nitroso compounds that handle the development of bladder, and colorectal cancer. However, this is a very complicated issue as people make use of chlorinated water as a form of preventing themselves from harmful disease-causing organisms. Therefore, the development of these complications are not as a result of the unethical behavior of people but rather an emerging issue within their lifestyle[3].</p><p></p><p>However as far as it’s argued that cancer is a health challenge contributed by the unethical human activities on the environment, there are other ethical endeavors that can also contribute to the health defect. For instance, pollution cannot be fully controlled with the current population. Nevertheless, people should change their behaviors and lifestyle as a remedy towards controlling environmental pollution that acts as one of the causative elements of cancer in the society[4]. In consideration of the current environmental pollution issue and cancer, it is clear that it is the society’s choices have led to the dramatic increment of cancer cases. If every individual lives an ethical life with minimized pollution to the environment, then there will be fewer contributors of cancer in the society.</p><br />
