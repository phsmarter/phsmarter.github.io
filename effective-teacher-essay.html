                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>TOPIC : STUDY HABITS OF A JUNIOR STUDENT.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As a junior high school student, I have encountered some problems when it comes to distance learning. One of the main problems is distractions. When I'm studying, my phone keeps buzzing, and my siblings or parents keep talking to me. It's hard to concentrate, and I tend to get sidetracked easily. Another issue is the lack of motivation. Sometimes, I don't feel like studying, and I procrastinate until it's too late.</p><p></p><p>The problems that I have in distance learning are caused by the environment around me. Since I'm at home, there are a lot of things that distract me. My siblings are also studying from home, so it can get noisy and chaotic at times. It's also hard to maintain a routine since I don't have a strict schedule like in school.</p><p></p><p>To overcome these problems, I have come up with some solutions. First, I try to create a conducive environment for studying. I make sure that I'm in a quiet room, and I turn off my phone or put it on silent mode. I also try to study during hours when my siblings are not too busy with their online classes. Second, I try to motivate myself by setting goals and rewards. For example, if I finish studying for two hours straight, I reward myself with a snack or a short break.</p><p></p><p>My study habits involve a balance between studying and other activities. I make sure that I have enough time for my hobbies and interests, so I don't get burnt out. I also try to take breaks in between study sessions to rest my mind and recharge. When it comes to understanding topics, I read the materials thoroughly and take down notes. If there's something that I don't understand, I search for more information online or ask my teacher during our online class.</p><p></p><p>To prove that my study habits are effective, I would show my grades and how I was able to cope with the challenges of distance learning. I would also share my tips and tricks with my classmates and encourage them to try it out for themselves. Ultimately, the best way to prove that my study habits work is by consistently performing well in school and achieving my goals.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
