The last type is the (9) which works by piping hot steam from underground reservoirs directly into turbines from geothermal reservoirs, which power the generators to provide electricity. On the other hand, geothermal heat pumps are highly efficient renewable energy technology that is gaining wide acceptance for both residential and commercial buildings. It also known as (10). Its technology relies on the fact that the earth remains at a relatively constant temperature throughout the year. The geothermal heat pump takes advantage of this by transferring heat stored in the earth or in ground water into a building during the winter and transferring it out of the building and back into the ground during the summer.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                            20. List Atleast 10 positive and negative effect of technology in communication​</h2><br />
                        <strong>POSITIVE EFFECTS</strong><p></p><strong>Faster communication</strong>With today's technology, we can talk, skype, or even video call someone who lives hundreds of miles away.<strong></strong><strong>Speed and Efficiency</strong>Being able to rapidly access clients, coworkers, and vendors improves the productivity of any business operation.Communication LogEmails and messages can be hand-traced, permitting you to personalize what was discussed in previous contact. Through consumer retention management software, incoming phone calls may be captured and tracked in digital format.Overcoming DisabilitiesTechnology has increased communication for impaired individuals while also making it feasible in places where it was previously impossible.Mobile WorkersIt is possible for individuals to work any where while communicating with team members using cell phones and internet resources.<strong></strong><strong>Strengthened relations</strong>Technology has made it simple to stay in touch with old connections and has also aided in strengthening those connections.<strong></strong><strong>Better solutions</strong>Technology has brought the globe closer together and encouraged the sharing of ideas in order to discover better answers to any challenge.<strong></strong><strong>No barriers</strong>Communication is now simple; when you need to get something to someone quickly, cell phones and e-mails come in handy.<strong></strong><strong>Impact on relations</strong>The success of long-distance relationships can be attributed to technological advancements. Video conversations and social networking sites have helped individuals stay in contact.<strong></strong><strong>Reaching a Broader Audience</strong>As people's communication skills increase, so does the reach of their messages. For example, photos and videos recorded covertly with a cell phone can be quickly and easily shared online through websites such as YouTube, making it more difficult for oppressive regimes to maintain control.<p></p><strong>NEGATIVE EFFECTS</strong><p></p><strong>Lack of Relationship Building</strong>As a result of technology improvements, people's face-to-face encounters and phone conversations have reduced. Sending a quick txt is significantly more handy than making a phone call. While this efficiency is unquestionably advantageous, there is value in the call that is currently being squandered.<strong></strong><strong>Informal Communication</strong>Traditional written contact, such as letters sent by postal mail, is typically more professional in structure and tone, but email and texting might demonstrate a lesser level of professionalism.AddictiveSome social media services, such as online gaming, may be addictive. People have practically gotten addicted to the Internet and cell phones, which has resulted in a slew of anxiety illnesses. Internet addicts may feel lonely and alone.Malicious motivesMany people exploit social networking platforms by posing as someone else and communicating with unsuspecting creatures. This human instinct has caused more damage than good.Effect on nonverbal communicationNonverbal communication has also been influenced by technological advancements. Individuals' nonverbal grasping capacities have been weakened due to a lack of face-to-face engagement.Reduced social interactionsConsider how individuals interact with one another. Life has altered dramatically; there are no longer any social gatherings or get-togethers (the frequency has been reduced). People are more concerned with their online lives than with their offline lives.Impact on interpersonal communicationThe current generation lacks crucial communication skills (the ability to express ideas and thoughts to others face to face). The rising level of interaction via txt and messaging app is one major factor for this development.Physical effectsObesity is one of the most hazardous side effects of technology. People who are engrossed by a laptop or a tablet tend to munch more, stay up later, and exercise less. Furthermore, sedentary lifestyles are the cause of many people's bent backbones and poor posture.Dangers to privacy and securityWhen technology is overused, it can expose you to a variety of dangers. Children are especially vulnerable. One out of every three teens reported being a victim of cyberbullying. To contact the target, the criminals employ txt messages, social media, or forums.Negative effects on mental healthThe continual illumination from screens has an effect on the sleep hormone melatonin. Keeping technology around is likely to disrupt your sleep and have an impact on your overall health. What's worse is that individuals grow addicted to technology. This has a negative impact on a person's health and social life, as well as destroying social and family bonds.<br /><br /><br /><br />

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.
