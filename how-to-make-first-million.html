                                            Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</a>

                                            what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</a>

There are several common reasons why cats won't use kitty doors. First, they may notunderstand how a kitty door works. They may not understand that it is a little doorway just for them. Second,many kitty doors are dark, and cats cannot see to the other side. As such, they can't be sure of what is on theother side of the door, so they won't take the risk One laat reason cats won't use kitty doors is because somecats don't like the feeling of pushing through the door and having the door drag across their back.

                                            For many people, killing is accepted as a crime. Whatever form it may be, it is still a crime. How about a life that was not yet born in this world but was intentionally ceased due to some certain reasons? Is that a crime? Many say that no mother will ever harm her child or children, however many cases contradict this statement and that one includes illegal abortion. In the Philippines, which is known for being an overpopulated country, early child pregnancy is always around the corner. Especially in the dump sites where going to school is not quite a routine, many Filipino youth are more exposed to unintended pregnancy which often results in a horrific scenario that is illegal abortion. In 2008, there were 1.9 million unintended pregnancies in the Philippines, resulting in two main outcomes-unplanned births and unsafe abortions. In the Philippines, 37% of all births are either not wanted at the time of pregnancy or entirely unwanted, and 54% of all pregnancies are unintended. On average, Filipino women give birth to more children than they want, highlighting how difficult for a woman to meet her fertility desires. This is particularly striking among the poorest Filipino women, who have nearly two children more than they intend to have (Finer and Hussain, 2013). This is a major problem among young Filipino men and women of this generation. More often, they do not think of the consequences of their actions first, that is why when they commit a mistake, another serious mistake will be held without even thinking of a more severe result. Young Filipinos of this time must be educated more about unintended or early pregnancy especially illegal abortion. They must inculcate in their minds that making hasty decisions would not help in solving a problem because a problem is not solved by making another severe problem.Question:1.

Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration   of the environment.
The first Earth Day led to the creation of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA)  and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered   Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress  worked together  to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment.

                                            Why Does the Philippines Have 7000 Islands? At a time when there was only a single great mass of land between the great sky and an equally great water, a large prehistoric bird got bored of circling around the same area for millions of years. It had made several attempts to fly as far as it could, to discover what lay beyond the far hori- zons. However, the big bird was always forced to go back, because there was no other land on where he could rest his tired wings. One day, the bird came up with a clever idea. The schem- ing bird told the water that the sky was irritated by the way the water kept on copying the sky's hue. If it decided to don a blue color, then water also became blue; if the sky was clear and white, the water became clear and neutral too. The sky hated it the most that the water imitated even the former's dark mood, because the water also turned gray and somewhat murky. Water of course became indignant upon hearing this; and it heaved a deep breath to which great amounts of water rose up in the form of gigantic waves, high enough to reach the sky and fill its clouds with water. The sky was puzzled at the water's behavior because it seemed that it was intentionally pelting the sky. The scheming bird approached the sky and told the latter that the water was resenting the fact that the sky often made the decisions on what color they had to have. Even if water reflecting itself wanted to try other colors, the sky kept on on the water's surface. Sky, of course, was furious upon hearing this that it let out loud roars of thunder and flashes of lightning that hit not only water but also the large mass of land. It drained out all the waters carried in its clouds while water continued to pelt huge waves against the sky. All these affected the great I mass of land because it slowly softened and weakened as ought against each other's might. Soon enough, the great mass of land started to break into little pieces much to the delight of the bird. Sky and water saw what had happened, and as a result, stopped fighting and tried with all their might to bring back the pieces of land together. It was too late because there were about 7000 pieces of land that were too far away from the main land. The bird of course finally fulfilled his wish of traveling far and wide, beyond the horizons.PLEASE PO I NEED ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY Visual Auditory Olfactory Gustatory Tactile Motion SENSORY IMAGES After Reading 1 Understand 1.

                                            Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                                            Activity 15: Speech WritingPlease refer to the Practical Task.GUIDED GENERALIZATIONIdentify what type of speech is used in the following:1.___________________________________________________________________ Did you know that during the first months of 2004, approximately 200 million birds died or were destroyed in attempt to stop the pandemic of avian influenza? Did you hear that United Nations contributor, Dr. David Navarro, estimated the number of possible human casualties as 5 – 150 million people? Are you aware that since its discovery in the 1990”s, the avian flu has been contracted by more than 100 people, and one of them died? (www.speech.guru)2._____________________________________________________________________ I will finish my speech by one of my favourite quotations. It is taken from the book written by a brilliant mathematician who dared to believe in the incredible. You must have read it in your childhood, but I want you to recall, re-evaluate and remember it. “There is no use trying, said Alice; one can’t believe impossible things. I dare say you haven’t had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast” (Louis Carol).3._________________________________________________________________________ The process itself falls into four simple steps. First, ensure that the wide end of the knot is approximately 30 cm lower than the narrow end and cross the wide end over the narrow one. This will create a loop between the collar and your will-be-tie. Pass the wide end through this loop and then down. So the wide end will again be on top of the narrow one4.__________________________________________________________________________How many of you think guns are necessary to protect yourself? Would you feel the same way if you knew how often guns kill children? I don’t think so! Magazines usually tell people how beautiful and powerful guns are, and never mention how many children get hurt by guns every 0day. But I am here to ask all of you to oppose gun ownership because the fact is that guns are a weapon of violence, they take more lives away every year, and they make people blind to the fact they are killing their own children.5.___________________________________________________________________________The term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-? Webster dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing pre-occupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act-often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual (academichelp.net)​</a>

                                            Read each paragraph. Then select the answer that best describes the author’s purpose and perspectives in writing.  Until the 1960s, people in the United States did not particularly pay  attention to the natural environment. Rather, Americans were more  focused on the economy. However, with an increase  in oil spills, polluting factories  and power plants, and the loss of wilderness, suddenly  people  realizes they shared  common values.  They called for a national  organization  to protect  the environment. Accordingly,  on April 22, 1970, the first Earth DAY, 20 MILLION Americans  took to the streets, parks  and auditoriums  to demonstrate for a healthy, sustainable  environment. Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration of the environment.  The first Earth Day led to the creation  of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress worked together to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment. The EPA  was  assigned  the daunting  task  of repairing  the damage already done  to the natural environment.  Question:  Why does the author mention the first Earth Day in paragraph 2?  Select one: a. to demonstrate an event that attacked the national government b. to illustrate how this event resulted in an important organization c. to explain the public’s dissatisfaction over the lack of health benefits d. to provide an example of the creation of a national holiday</a>

C. Identify the structure of the following passages.
____1. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they give kisses and make up.
____2. How does rain form? Water droplets form from warm air. As the warm air rises in the sky it cools. Water vapor (invisible water in the air) always exist in our air. Warm air holds quite a bit of water. For example in the summer it is usually very humid. When enough of these droplets collect together, we see them as clouds. if the clouds are big enough and form even bigger drops. When the drops get heavy, they fall because of gravity, and you see and feel rain.
____3. The earth's surface is constantly changing through slow processes that we dont usually see. One is erosion. This has worn away rocks and mountains over million of years, caused by air, water, and wind. Another change is caused by earthquakes that originate deep inside the planet. More sudden and violent than erosion, an earthquake results when strains between Earth's plates produce shock waves. And. third process results when molten rock-forming material called lava, escapes onto the surface through gaps in the crust. what we experience is volcanic eruption.
____4. How are sedimentary rocks formed? Sedimentary rock is formed by the compression of layers of particles into a solid form. Sediments such as sand and mud settle onto the floors of oceans and lakes. Over a long period of time, several layers of sediments collect on the floor. Gradually these layers are pressed together for many thousands of years, fusing the small solid particles of mud and sand to form rock. This type of rock is called sedimentary rock.
____5. Do you want to make a kite? First, you must have all the materials needed for you to be able to make one. You must dampen cane to make flexible. Next, carefully bend cane to desired shape, then tie securely with thread. Then, lay frame on sheet of paper and trace around frame with pencil. After that, cut covering approximately 1 cm larger than outline and paint on covering over the frame carefully, and glue them down. Lastly, put strings one each and end tie the other ends in a knot.</a>

                            5. Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives."

                            6. what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</h2><br />

There are several common reasons why cats won't use kitty doors. First, they may notunderstand how a kitty door works. They may not understand that it is a little doorway just for them. Second,many kitty doors are dark, and cats cannot see to the other side. As such, they can't be sure of what is on theother side of the door, so they won't take the risk One laat reason cats won't use kitty doors is because somecats don't like the feeling of pushing through the door and having the door drag across their back.

                            9. For many people, killing is accepted as a crime. Whatever form it may be, it is still a crime. How about a life that was not yet born in this world but was intentionally ceased due to some certain reasons? Is that a crime? Many say that no mother will ever harm her child or children, however many cases contradict this statement and that one includes illegal abortion. In the Philippines, which is known for being an overpopulated country, early child pregnancy is always around the corner. Especially in the dump sites where going to school is not quite a routine, many Filipino youth are more exposed to unintended pregnancy which often results in a horrific scenario that is illegal abortion. In 2008, there were 1.9 million unintended pregnancies in the Philippines, resulting in two main outcomes-unplanned births and unsafe abortions. In the Philippines, 37% of all births are either not wanted at the time of pregnancy or entirely unwanted, and 54% of all pregnancies are unintended. On average, Filipino women give birth to more children than they want, highlighting how difficult for a woman to meet her fertility desires. This is particularly striking among the poorest Filipino women, who have nearly two children more than they intend to have (Finer and Hussain, 2013). This is a major problem among young Filipino men and women of this generation. More often, they do not think of the consequences of their actions first, that is why when they commit a mistake, another serious mistake will be held without even thinking of a more severe result. Young Filipinos of this time must be educated more about unintended or early pregnancy especially illegal abortion. They must inculcate in their minds that making hasty decisions would not help in solving a problem because a problem is not solved by making another severe problem.Question:1.

                            13. Until the 1960s, people in the United States did not particularly pay attention to the natural environment. Rather, Americans were more focused on the economy. However, with an increase in oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, and the loss of wilderness, suddenly  people  realizes they shared  common values.  They called for a national  organization  to protect  the environment. Accordingly, on April 22, 1970, the first Earth DAY, 20 MILLION Americans  took to the streets, parks  and auditoriums  to demonstrate  for a healthy, sustainable  environment. Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration   of the environment.
The first Earth Day led to the creation of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA)  and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered   Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress  worked together  to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment. The EPA  was  assigned  the daunting  task  of repairing  the damage already done  to the natural environment.

                            14. Why Does the Philippines Have 7000 Islands? At a time when there was only a single great mass of land between the great sky and an equally great water, a large prehistoric bird got bored of circling around the same area for millions of years. It had made several attempts to fly as far as it could, to discover what lay beyond the far hori- zons. However, the big bird was always forced to go back, because there was no other land on where he could rest his tired wings. One day, the bird came up with a clever idea. The schem- ing bird told the water that the sky was irritated by the way the water kept on copying the sky's hue. If it decided to don a blue color, then water also became blue; if the sky was clear and white, the water became clear and neutral too. The sky hated it the most that the water imitated even the former's dark mood, because the water also turned gray and somewhat murky. Water of course became indignant upon hearing this; and it heaved a deep breath to which great amounts of water rose up in the form of gigantic waves, high enough to reach the sky and fill its clouds with water. The sky was puzzled at the water's behavior because it seemed that it was intentionally pelting the sky. The scheming bird approached the sky and told the latter that the water was resenting the fact that the sky often made the decisions on what color they had to have. Even if water reflecting itself wanted to try other colors, the sky kept on on the water's surface. Sky, of course, was furious upon hearing this that it let out loud roars of thunder and flashes of lightning that hit not only water but also the large mass of land. It drained out all the waters carried in its clouds while water continued to pelt huge waves against the sky. All these affected the great I mass of land because it slowly softened and weakened as ought against each other's might. Soon enough, the great mass of land started to break into little pieces much to the delight of the bird. Sky and water saw what had happened, and as a result, stopped fighting and tried with all their might to bring back the pieces of land together. It was too late because there were about 7000 pieces of land that were too far away from the main land. The bird of course finally fulfilled his wish of traveling far and wide, beyond the horizons.PLEASE PO I NEED ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY Visual Auditory Olfactory Gustatory Tactile Motion SENSORY IMAGES After Reading 1 Understand 1.

However, with an increase in oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, and the loss of wilderness, suddenly  people  realizes they shared  common values.  They called for a national  organization  to protect  the environment. Accordingly, on April 22, 1970, the first Earth DAY, 20 MILLION Americans  took to the streets, parks  and auditoriums  to demonstrate  for a healthy, sustainable  environment. Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration   of the environment.  The first Earth Day led to the creation of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA)  and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered   Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress  worked together  to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment. The EPA  was  assigned  the daunting  task  of repairing  the damage already done  to the natural environment.  Question:  What is the author’s purpose in paragraph 2?  Select one: a. to propose the need for further actions by the government b. to describe how the government became more involved in cleaning the environment c. to discuss public demonstration that demanded a cleaner environment d. to suggest that the government needed to control polluting factories and power plants</h2><br />

                            18. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />

                            19. Activity 15: Speech WritingPlease refer to the Practical Task.GUIDED GENERALIZATIONIdentify what type of speech is used in the following:1.___________________________________________________________________ Did you know that during the first months of 2004, approximately 200 million birds died or were destroyed in attempt to stop the pandemic of avian influenza? Did you hear that United Nations contributor, Dr. David Navarro, estimated the number of possible human casualties as 5 – 150 million people? Are you aware that since its discovery in the 1990”s, the avian flu has been contracted by more than 100 people, and one of them died? (www.speech.guru)2._____________________________________________________________________ I will finish my speech by one of my favourite quotations. It is taken from the book written by a brilliant mathematician who dared to believe in the incredible. You must have read it in your childhood, but I want you to recall, re-evaluate and remember it. “There is no use trying, said Alice; one can’t believe impossible things. I dare say you haven’t had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast” (Louis Carol).3._________________________________________________________________________ The process itself falls into four simple steps. First, ensure that the wide end of the knot is approximately 30 cm lower than the narrow end and cross the wide end over the narrow one. This will create a loop between the collar and your will-be-tie. Pass the wide end through this loop and then down. So the wide end will again be on top of the narrow one4.__________________________________________________________________________How many of you think guns are necessary to protect yourself? Would you feel the same way if you knew how often guns kill children? I don’t think so! Magazines usually tell people how beautiful and powerful guns are, and never mention how many children get hurt by guns every 0day. But I am here to ask all of you to oppose gun ownership because the fact is that guns are a weapon of violence, they take more lives away every year, and they make people blind to the fact they are killing their own children.5.___________________________________________________________________________The term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-? Webster dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing pre-occupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act-often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual (academichelp.net)​</h2><br />

                            27. Read each paragraph. Then select the answer that best describes the author’s purpose and perspectives in writing.  Until the 1960s, people in the United States did not particularly pay  attention to the natural environment. Rather, Americans were more  focused on the economy. However, with an increase  in oil spills, polluting factories  and power plants, and the loss of wilderness, suddenly  people  realizes they shared  common values.  They called for a national  organization  to protect  the environment. Accordingly,  on April 22, 1970, the first Earth DAY, 20 MILLION Americans  took to the streets, parks  and auditoriums  to demonstrate for a healthy, sustainable  environment. Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration of the environment.  The first Earth Day led to the creation  of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress worked together to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment. The EPA  was  assigned  the daunting  task  of repairing  the damage already done  to the natural environment.  Question:  Why does the author mention the first Earth Day in paragraph 2?  Select one: a. to demonstrate an event that attacked the national government b. to illustrate how this event resulted in an important organization c. to explain the public’s dissatisfaction over the lack of health benefits d. to provide an example of the creation of a national holiday</h2><br />

C. Identify the structure of the following passages.
____1. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they give kisses and make up.
____2. How does rain form? Water droplets form from warm air. As the warm air rises in the sky it cools. Water vapor (invisible water in the air) always exist in our air. Warm air holds quite a bit of water. For example in the summer it is usually very humid. When enough of these droplets collect together, we see them as clouds. if the clouds are big enough and form even bigger drops. When the drops get heavy, they fall because of gravity, and you see and feel rain.
____3. The earth's surface is constantly changing through slow processes that we dont usually see. One is erosion. This has worn away rocks and mountains over million of years, caused by air, water, and wind. Another change is caused by earthquakes that originate deep inside the planet. More sudden and violent than erosion, an earthquake results when strains between Earth's plates produce shock waves. And. third process results when molten rock-forming material called lava, escapes onto the surface through gaps in the crust. what we experience is volcanic eruption.
____4. How are sedimentary rocks formed? Sedimentary rock is formed by the compression of layers of particles into a solid form. Sediments such as sand and mud settle onto the floors of oceans and lakes. Over a long period of time, several layers of sediments collect on the floor. Gradually these layers are pressed together for many thousands of years, fusing the small solid particles of mud and sand to form rock. This type of rock is called sedimentary rock.
____5. Do you want to make a kite? First, you must have all the materials needed for you to be able to make one. You must dampen cane to make flexible. Next, carefully bend cane to desired shape, then tie securely with thread. Then, lay frame on sheet of paper and trace around frame with pencil. After that, cut covering approximately 1 cm larger than outline and paint on covering over the frame carefully, and glue them down. Lastly, put strings one each and end tie the other ends in a knot.</h2><br />
