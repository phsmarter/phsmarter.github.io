Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells ofanimals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When thishappens, the virus uses the cell's chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible forcausing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. Inconclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.7. It is definitely frightful to be infected with COVID-19. Though a large number ofpatients experience mild symptoms, turning it to a severe condition is still a possibility. I could notimagine a patient to experience chest pain, loss of speech or movement, and difficulty in breathingWhat is worse is the patient is all alone when he or she experiences all these struggles. Furthermore,anxiety and self-pity add to the struggle of the patients. Therefore, in order to avoid such conditions,let us not put our guards down from COVID-198. Cooking spaghert is very simple.

Finally, top with grated cheeseand serve. These are the easy steps to cook spaghetti.9. Crocodiles and alligators are different species. They don't belong to the samebiological family. Crocodiles came from the family of Crocodilia while alligators came from the familyof Alligatoridae. In terms of their habitat, crocodiles prefer to live in saltwater while alligators live infreshwater like rivers and lakes. The main reason for this geographical separation is that Crocodileshave well-developed salt glands on their tongue that expel large amounts of sait, enabling them tolive in more salty waters. However, alligators' salt glands don't function well, leading them to stick tofreshwater habitats. Another way to differentiate the two is by looking at the shape of their snoutsCracodiles have long pointed V shaped snouts while alligators have rounded U-shaped snouts. Thesefeatures make crocodiles and alligators distinct from each other.10. Despite the problems brought by the pandemic, it has undeniably cultivated certainFilipino values.

However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description3. Because of COVID-19 pandemic, there are safety protocols that must be followed when entering some establishments. First you must wear face mask and face shield. Next, present your quarantine pass. Then, the personnel will check your temperature. If your body temperature is 37°C and below, you can enter the establishment. After that, you will fill out a form asking for your contact information. Once done, you can proceed with your transaction but you will be asked to observe social distancing. These measures must be followed to ensure your safety and to avoid getting the virus.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg.

                                            what I can DoUsing the same data extracted table from the unpublishedresearch paper identify the table which the following interpretationbest describeInterpretation A: Table #Most (3 out of 5) of the respondentswere worried much for they do not knowwhat to do with the situation. The role changing happened due to physical changes ofthe body and the thought of having another life put themselves in a dilemma ofadditional responsibility yet they are too young, incapable of supporting oneself andfinancially dependent from parents for their studies. Since the partner also do nothave the capability to handle the responsibility, for they are still young to think of,some got separated leaving the teenage mother to take all the responsibilities.Though parents felt bad, they still accepted and no other choice but to help theteenage pregnant mother.According to Bandura as stated by Cherry (2011) acceptance is an importantstage in the process to reach the goal of successful adjustment. People with a strongsense of self-efficacy: view challenging problems as tasks to be mastered, developdeeper interest in the activities in which they participate, form a stronger sense ofcommitment to their interests and activities, and recover quickly from setbacks anddisappointments.Interpretation B: Table #Majority (3 out of 5) of the respondents felt much better as their parentsaccepted the fact of being pregnant at an early age despite the drama of thesituation. Table 3 showed that acceptance of having a baby, role changes to self andnew responsibilities made the respondents happy towards adjustment with the helpand support of parents and friends. Excitement of the coming of the baby is ablessing in disguise for the family and friends that somehow gave encouragement tothe teenage mother to continue to take care and love and determined to continuetheir studies in preparation for the future of oneself and the baby.A different way or process of adjustment, that starts with the sense of self ofhaving an impact on life experiences, which somehow relationships of family, andfriends have the influenced on how to undergo the process of adjustment. Accordingto Añonuevo, C.A as stated by Natividad et al, (2005), family is still the primarysource of care. The family is very important in the care of adolescents. Though thefamily is facing many changes and challenges, it continues to have the responsibilityof taking care of each member's needs. Such relationships of close family tiescherished older person to adjust situations of life successfully.Pa answer po​</a>

They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When this happens, the virus uses the cell’s chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible for causing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. In conclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.

2.Some scientists claim that Corona Virus can be airborne. However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.

4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.

Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells ofanimals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When thishappens, the virus uses the cell's chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible forcausing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. Inconclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.7. It is definitely frightful to be infected with COVID-19. Though a large number ofpatients experience mild symptoms, turning it to a severe condition is still a possibility. I could notimagine a patient to experience chest pain, loss of speech or movement, and difficulty in breathingWhat is worse is the patient is all alone when he or she experiences all these struggles. Furthermore,anxiety and self-pity add to the struggle of the patients. Therefore, in order to avoid such conditions,let us not put our guards down from COVID-198. Cooking spaghert is very simple.

Crocodiles came from the family of Crocodilia while alligators came from the familyof Alligatoridae. In terms of their habitat, crocodiles prefer to live in saltwater while alligators live infreshwater like rivers and lakes. The main reason for this geographical separation is that Crocodileshave well-developed salt glands on their tongue that expel large amounts of sait, enabling them tolive in more salty waters. However, alligators' salt glands don't function well, leading them to stick tofreshwater habitats. Another way to differentiate the two is by looking at the shape of their snoutsCracodiles have long pointed V shaped snouts while alligators have rounded U-shaped snouts. Thesefeatures make crocodiles and alligators distinct from each other.10. Despite the problems brought by the pandemic, it has undeniably cultivated certainFilipino values.

However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.

Because of COVID-19 pandemic, there are safety protocols that must be followed when entering some establishments. First you must wear face mask and face shield. Next, present your quarantine pass. Then, the personnel will check your temperature. If your body temperature is 37°C and below, you can enter the establishment. After that, you will fill out a form asking for your contact information. Once done, you can proceed with your transaction but you will be asked to observe social distancing. These measures must be followed to ensure your safety and to avoid getting the virus.a.

As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg.

                            8. what I can DoUsing the same data extracted table from the unpublishedresearch paper identify the table which the following interpretationbest describeInterpretation A: Table #Most (3 out of 5) of the respondentswere worried much for they do not knowwhat to do with the situation. The role changing happened due to physical changes ofthe body and the thought of having another life put themselves in a dilemma ofadditional responsibility yet they are too young, incapable of supporting oneself andfinancially dependent from parents for their studies. Since the partner also do nothave the capability to handle the responsibility, for they are still young to think of,some got separated leaving the teenage mother to take all the responsibilities.Though parents felt bad, they still accepted and no other choice but to help theteenage pregnant mother.According to Bandura as stated by Cherry (2011) acceptance is an importantstage in the process to reach the goal of successful adjustment. People with a strongsense of self-efficacy: view challenging problems as tasks to be mastered, developdeeper interest in the activities in which they participate, form a stronger sense ofcommitment to their interests and activities, and recover quickly from setbacks anddisappointments.Interpretation B: Table #Majority (3 out of 5) of the respondents felt much better as their parentsaccepted the fact of being pregnant at an early age despite the drama of thesituation. Table 3 showed that acceptance of having a baby, role changes to self andnew responsibilities made the respondents happy towards adjustment with the helpand support of parents and friends. Excitement of the coming of the baby is ablessing in disguise for the family and friends that somehow gave encouragement tothe teenage mother to continue to take care and love and determined to continuetheir studies in preparation for the future of oneself and the baby.A different way or process of adjustment, that starts with the sense of self ofhaving an impact on life experiences, which somehow relationships of family, andfriends have the influenced on how to undergo the process of adjustment. Accordingto Añonuevo, C.A as stated by Natividad et al, (2005), family is still the primarysource of care. The family is very important in the care of adolescents. Though thefamily is facing many changes and challenges, it continues to have the responsibilityof taking care of each member's needs. Such relationships of close family tiescherished older person to adjust situations of life successfully.Pa answer po​</h2><br />

2.Some scientists claim that Corona Virus can be airborne. However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.

4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.
