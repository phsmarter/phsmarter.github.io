Attitude  Attitudes, which affect the individual's subsequent behavior or perception, are formed in two ways, directly or indirectly. Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior. TV, with its extremely graphic and attractive presentation, leaves hard-to-forget images in the viewers' minds. In addition, newscasters and commentators over the TV and the radio, and opinion makers in the Internet definitely affect attitude formation of the masses. Also of growing importance as indirect molders of people's outlooks are advocacy groups that come together to discuss issues. Church leaders, activists, human rights conformists, and any other social groups maintain ensconced beliefs and value systems. By and large, people's outlooks are defined, changed and strengthened through the different means of attitude formation.</a>

Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior.

                                            The organisms of the same kind, we call it species that live in the same area make up a population. Like when individual person lives in the same location or area, they make up the human population of that area, and if a certain species of fish like milkfish or locally known as “Bangus”, are living in the same area, they comprise the milkfish population. The entire array populations that live in the same location make up a community. The community consists of different populations of organism living in the same area. For example, the Laguna Lake caters to different kinds of living things like fishes, water plants and grasses. All of these organisms comprise the community of living things in the lake. When the community interacts with its physical environment which includes water, air, sunlight, soil, rock and minerals. This brings us to the next level of organization called ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a given area together with the nonliving things. The Laguna Lake is an example of an ecosystem. A group of similar ecosystems with the same type of physical environment is called a biome. Many different biomes consist our biosphere. The biosphere is the part of our planet where all life exists including all of the environments on Earth that support life.

                            5. Identify whether the technique used in writing the following passage is Classification, Cause and Effect, Comparison and Contrast, Analogy, Definition, Persuasion, Process Description, or Interpretation.      Attitude  Attitudes, which affect the individual's subsequent behavior or perception, are formed in two ways, directly or indirectly. Directly, they are learned through firsthand experience and socialization. Experience-based attitudes are stable, less changeable, and more salient for the individual. They, too, are shaped directly through socialization. Children learn by example from their elders at home or from their teachers in school. Indirectly, effective modifiers of people's attitudes are subordered into the media and advocacy groups. Media is further classified into print media and TV or radio media. Print media with its loaded language arouses extreme feelings that feed into the readers' minds, thus, influencing behavior. TV, with its extremely graphic and attractive presentation, leaves hard-to-forget images in the viewers' minds. In addition, newscasters and commentators over the TV and the radio, and opinion makers in the Internet definitely affect attitude formation of the masses. Also of growing importance as indirect molders of people's outlooks are advocacy groups that come together to discuss issues. Church leaders, activists, human rights conformists, and any other social groups maintain ensconced beliefs and value systems. By and large, people's outlooks are defined, changed and strengthened through the different means of attitude formation.</h2><br />

                            26. The organisms of the same kind, we call it species that live in the same area make up a population. Like when individual person lives in the same location or area, they make up the human population of that area, and if a certain species of fish like milkfish or locally known as “Bangus”, are living in the same area, they comprise the milkfish population. The entire array populations that live in the same location make up a community. The community consists of different populations of organism living in the same area. For example, the Laguna Lake caters to different kinds of living things like fishes, water plants and grasses. All of these organisms comprise the community of living things in the lake. When the community interacts with its physical environment which includes water, air, sunlight, soil, rock and minerals. This brings us to the next level of organization called ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a given area together with the nonliving things. The Laguna Lake is an example of an ecosystem. A group of similar ecosystems with the same type of physical environment is called a biome. Many different biomes consist our biosphere. The biosphere is the part of our planet where all life exists including all of the environments on Earth that support life. These include regions of land, bodies of water and the lower portion of the atmosphere. , D Learning Task 1 : Study the given diagram. Complete it using the different terms presented inside the box.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Wildlife Populations
</p><p>Populations are all the members of a species that live in a one area. You are part of the human population for your home town. A freshwater pond has multiple populations, including a population of mallard ducks, and a population of cattail plants growing on the edge.
</p><p>
</p><p>All of the populations that live and interact with each other in one area make of the community of that area. Our freshwater pond community includes the mallard ducks, the cattail plants, the fish in the pond, and many other species.
</p><p>
</p><p>The populations and community are affected by many non-living factors in the area, such as the water of the pond, the amount of sunlight, the different nutrients of the soil, and even the quality of the air. All these living and non-living components form the ecosystem of freshwater pond.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ducks on a river
</p><p>The interactions of an ecosystem are often described as webs that show how the pieces are interrelated. An example of a generic food web in an ecosystem is shown below. All the species connect in multiple interactions, and are dependent on each other.
</p><p>
</p><p>ecosystem diagram
</p><p>For the ecosystem to be healthy, every part of that ecosystem must be healthy too. Likewise, to protect an ecosystem, every part, from soil to water to prey animals to predators, must be protected.
</p><p>
</p><p>If one piece of the web is damaged, everything it interacts with will be affected. It is this interrelatedness that explains why losing one species can lead to the loss of other species.
</p><p>
</p><p>When ecosystems become unbalance, whole populations of animals are more susceptible to diseases or other disturbances. The health of ecosystems is a delicate balance of plant, animal, environment, and human interaction.
</p><p>
</p><p>Human activities are one of the biggest influences on ecosystems and the populations in them. The graph below shows the decline in the American Woodcock populations in every state except Illinois. Woodcocks live in forest ecosystems, and human population growth has caused a decrease in forest size as more land is developed for human homes, agriculture, and industry. The growing human population has caused many wildlife populations like the woodcock populations to decrease in size.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>BRAINLIEST ME PLS #KEEPONLEARNING AND #LEARNINGNEVERSTOP</p><br />
