It evolved as a pure manifestation of synchronized feeling and action. Because it reacts to historical and religious events as well as social and political remarks, dance is seen as the mirror of society. People still dance primarily for four reasons: (a) to appease gods; (b) to appease others; (c) to appease themselves; and (d) to foster community within an ethnic group or social interaction, despite the vast comparative variations in time and culture.</p><p></p><p>During the <strong>Prehistoric</strong> Period, dance was a significant form of social expression and religious rite in primitive culture. It is founded on superstition and imbued with magic, and was utilized as a means of expression and to strengthen tribe unity and power. Lead dancers known as shamans served as the tribes' healers, spiritual authorities, and guardians.</p><p></p><p>Dance in the <strong>Late 16th and 17th Centuries</strong> intricate pageants and performances gave rise to masque dancing in the 16th century. Masque dance required elaborate costume creation and set construction, as well as singing, acting, and dancing. It was frequently utilized as court entertainment. A time that was seen as being pleasantly deep and rich in the histories of dance in Italy, France, and England. During this time, French dance rose to prominence.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about dance here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/3953152#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
