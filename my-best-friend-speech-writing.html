Our parents pushed us to excel and to put everything we could into our schoolwork, leading us to give our best effort to school. Siblings and friends were there for us when we fell short of expectations, either those of our parents, teachers, or even our own. They reminded us what we are capable of and motivated us to continue working as hard as we could, either through encouraging words or more commonly through sibling rivalries. It is for this inspiration and encouragement that I thank not only my own family, but the families of all the graduates joining me onstage today.”​</a>
