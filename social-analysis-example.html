What simple example can you find using SWOT and PEST analysis? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Directly comparing SWOT vs PEST is probably the wrong thing to do. They are both planning methods that give tremendous insights for you to successfully execute projects.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>SWOT analysis considers both the internal and external factors. It captures the external factors in the opportunities and threats section. However, when creating a SWOT diagram a deep analysis of external factors are not performed. At least not as extensively as a PEST analysis. So you might miss out on external factors that can benefit your project. So a better approach would be to perform an extensive PEST analysis and use that finding in the opportunities and threats section in the SWOT analysis.</p><br />
