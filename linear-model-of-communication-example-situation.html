While some models go into greater detail to explain communication than others, even the most intricate model is unable to capture the essence of even the briefest communication contact. For communication students, models are still helpful because they help us define communication, apply communication principles, and see specific ideas and phases in the communication process.</p><p></p><p>Despite the differences between these communication methods, they have some characteristics. Participants, messages, encoding, decoding, and channels are all components of the <strong>transmission</strong> model and the <strong>interaction</strong> model, the first two models we'll talk about. In communication models, the senders and/or receivers of messages during a communication encounter are the participants. The verbal or nonverbal information being sent from the sender to the recipient is known as the message. For instance, when you say "Hello!" to a buddy, you are conveying a greeting that your friend will hear.</p><p></p>Linear communication model<p>The linear or transmission model of communication views communication as a <strong>one-way</strong>, linear process in which a sender consciously delivers a message to a recipient (Ellis &amp; McClintock, 1990). Within a communication interaction, this paradigm places special emphasis on the sender and message. Despite being a part of the model, the receiver is seen more as a goal or conclusion than as a continuing process.</p><p></p>Model of interactive communication<p>According to the interactive or interaction model of communication, communication is a process in which participants switch between the roles of sender and receiver to generate meaning by communicating and receiving feedback in a variety of social and physical contexts (Schramm, 1997). The interactive model includes feedback, which transforms communication into a more engaging, <strong>two-way</strong> process rather than depicting it as a linear, one-way process.</p>Communication through transactions<p>As communication research developed, models grew to incorporate more of the communication process. Many academics believe that communication encompasses more than just the act of having dialogues and expressing meaning. We don't send messages as computers do, and we don't smoothly switch between the sender and receiver positions as a conversation progresses. Because communication involves more than just sending and receiving signals, we are also unable to deliberately decide to cease communicating. The conceptualization of communication, the functions of sender and receiver, and the significance of context are only a few examples of how the transaction model differs significantly from the transmission and interaction models (Barnlund, 1970).</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about example situations of the Shannon weaver model Schramm model and transactional model​: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/5069732#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
