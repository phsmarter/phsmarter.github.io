                        Not most people are blessed with a complete and happy family. Some people are unfortunate to only have one parent or none at all or it may be complete but internally it's broken. You don't get to choose the family you have and sometimes the only choice you have is just live with it hoping one day it will change. This however creates a negative impact especially on the children. It creates that lonely and cumbersome feeling in their hearts that may affect their perspective in life.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When you grow up in a broken home, you can understand the feeling of wanting to be loved. It's something that you will always want in life because it's something that you didn't have growing up. You tend to have a big heart for people, and continuously wish that you could have the same love in return</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being part of a broken family is something that many people live with, though a lot of the time, they don’t show it.</p><p>That one kid from class, a work-mate or even that cashier from your local Woolies could come from a broken family and you’d never even realise.</p><p></p><p>You learn from a young age that people are often insensitive, as most people don’t care about what’s going on at your home and often don’t acknowledge it if they don’t see it. While you’re not seeking any pity, a little consideration goes a long way. However, you go on to learn that if it doesn’t leave a physical mark, people often don’t care.</p><p></p><p>When you come from a broken family, it feels like you’re isolated and cut-off from the rest of the world. Being so distant to a parent or a sibling often pressures you into feeling like you need to deal with it by yourself. Why? Because it’s embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>It’s embarrassing because it feels like you’re the only one with a family who can’t seem to get along. It’s embarrassing because while everyone gets picked up by their parents, you’re left to hitching a ride or public transport.</p><p></p><p>It hurts. It hurts because it’s sometimes difficult to understand why your family is like this. Why you have to suffer while everyone else is so seemingly happy with their families. Why you hurt so badly when other families get along so well. Why it’s not your fault.</p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>#StaySafe</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><br />

We are all familiar with the concept and institution of the family, whether it is the biological family into which a person was born, an adopted family into which a person is ingrained, or the close friends one claims as their "family." But what exactly is it that makes a family click? How does family shape and direct our lives? The underlying factor that keeps a family running smoothly is communication. Things can start to fall apart when there isn't consistent communication, as is the case in many situations.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p>Divorce is one of the most difficult life experiences a family can go through. It can have a profound impact on the emotional and psychological well-being of all members of the family. The disruption of family structure, roles, and relationships can cause long-term issues that can carry over into adulthood. While divorce does have its negative effects, it also presents an opportunity for families to learn and grow.</p><p></p><p>Body</p><p>Divorce can have a lasting impact on the mental health of those involved. Children in particular are vulnerable to the changes that come with family divorce. They can experience feelings of confusion, guilt, and anger as they cope with the changes to their family structure and dynamics. Studies have also found that children of divorced parents are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and poorer academic performance. In addition, children of divorce are more likely to struggle with relationships and trust issues as they get older.</p><p></p><p>Divorce can also have a significant financial impact on families. The costs associated with divorce can be significant, including legal fees, child support, and alimony. These costs can add up quickly and put a strain on the family’s finances. In addition, many families struggle to adjust to the new financial realities that come with divorce, such as having one less income and having to divide assets.</p><p></p><p>Despite all of the challenges that come with family divorce, there are also opportunities for growth and healing. Divorce can be a difficult but necessary step in order to create a healthier and happier family dynamic. It can be an opportunity to reevaluate family roles and relationships and to create more equitable and fulfilling dynamics. It can also be an opportunity to learn how to communicate more effectively and to develop better problem-solving skills.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Divorce is a difficult and emotional experience for all members of the family. It can have a lasting impact on emotional and financial well-being. However, it also presents an opportunity for families to learn and grow. With open communication and support, family members can use the experience of divorce to create a healthier and happier family dynamic.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Divorce is a process that not only severs the legal ties of marriage, but also dissolves the emotional and physical bonds. It is a decision that is often made after much deliberation and thought and is not one that should be taken lightly. While there are many reasons why a couple may choose to divorce, the decision is often based on a lack of communication and intimacy, unresolved conflict, and a general feeling of unhappiness.</p><p></p><p>The process of divorce can be difficult for both the couple and their children. It can be a time of great upheaval and change and can be emotionally and financially taxing. There are, however, steps that can be taken to make the process as smooth as possible. Couples should try to communicate openly and honestly with each other and work to resolve any outstanding conflicts. They should also seek the help of professionals, such as therapists or divorce attorneys, who can assist them in the process.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the decision to divorce is a personal one. It is a decision that should be made after careful consideration and should not be taken lightly. Divorce is a difficult process, but with the help of professionals, it can be a relatively smooth experience,</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I was just six years old when my parents got divorced. When I tell people this, they are inclined to look at me with a melancholic expression and pity, but I always put a halt to it. I tell them that I was one of the fortunate few. My parents were civil to each other and my childhood was pretty decent.</p><p>I never considered either of my parents to be a single parent. Despite their divorce, they looked after me in unison. My time was divided amongst both of them. Half of the year, I resided at my father’s residence and the other half at my mother’s apartment. Their houses were just a ten minute drive from each other so I was never far away from either of them. Every Saturday night, we would have dinner together and there was no hostility. My parents were always present together to celebrate my birthdays, special festivals like Eid and important moments of my life like volleyball final matches, graduations and the list goes on. Even though, they were divorced, I had a functional life. </p><p>It seemed like my parents had figured out how to be divorced and still make sure I was not scarred by it. I had believed that I had been untouched by the horrible…show more content…</p><p>There have been many moments when instead of aiming to better my relationship with my husband, I was just avoiding conflict because deep inside, I believe conflict will eventually lead to divorce. The other day, my husband decided to invest our money from the joint account in a new construction venture even though I had told him not to. When I asked him about it, he listed the reasons as to why he believed strongly in the venture and could not let me make a mistake. After arguing a bit more, I stopped and said, “I guess you are right” with a big sigh. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>A broken family is a family that is not together and often has parents who are separated or divorced. It can be a difficult and challenging situation for children who have to navigate the complexities of a family that is no longer whole.</p><p></p><p>One of the most challenging aspects of a broken family is the feeling of loneliness. Children may feel alone, abandoned, or unloved, which can lead to feelings of sadness and depression. They may also feel angry, confused, and frustrated as they try to make sense of the changes happening around them.</p><p></p><p>In addition, a broken family can lead to financial difficulties, as one parent may be left to support the family on their own. This can lead to stress and strain on the family, as they struggle to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, there are many positive things that can come out of a broken family. For example, children may become more independent and self-sufficient, as they learn to take care of themselves and their siblings. They may also develop strong bonds with other family members, such as grandparents or aunts and uncles.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a broken family can be a difficult and challenging situation for children. However, with love, support, and perseverance, they can overcome these challenges and thrive.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>What the adjective words in the essay? </p><p></p><p>The adjectives used in the essay are:</p><p></p><p>difficult</p><p>challenging</p><p>whole</p><p>lonely</p><p>abandoned</p><p>unloved</p><p>sad</p><p>depressed</p><p>angry</p><p>confused</p><p>frustrated</p><p>positive</p><p>independent</p><p>self-sufficient</p><p>strong</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Christian view of marriage is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the Gospels, including the passage you referenced from Matthew 19:5-6. This passage highlights the importance of the union between a man and a woman in marriage and emphasizes the permanence and unity of the marriage bond.</p><p></p><p>Christianity teaches that marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman, instituted by God, and should be a lifelong commitment. The Bible teaches that marriage is a reflection of God's love for His people and that the relationship between a husband and wife should be characterized by mutual love, respect, and self-sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>However, the issue of divorce has been a contentious one within Christianity. While Jesus taught that divorce was not part of God's original plan for marriage and that it should be avoided, He also recognized that it was sometimes necessary due to the hardness of people's hearts (Matthew 19:8).</p><p></p><p>In general, the Catholic Church and many other Christian denominations hold that marriage is a permanent and indissoluble union, except in cases of grave sin or the invalidity of the marriage itself. In cases where divorce is allowed, the Church encourages individuals to seek annulment, which is a process of determining whether the marriage was validly contracted in the first place.</p><p></p><p>While divorce and family breakdown can be difficult and painful, Christianity teaches that God's love and grace are available to all who seek Him. The Church also seeks to support and minister to individuals and families who are going through difficult times, offering pastoral care, counseling, and other resources to help them through their struggles.</p><br />

                        <p>Many families in the world have problems. Some of these problems are small, while others are much larger. However, no matter how serious it is, it can have an impact on the family. It's no secret that families can be a source of immense joy, but they can also be a source of significant stress and conflict. Family problems can take many forms, from financial stress to relationship difficulties. And while not every family will experience all these problems, most families will likely experience at least some of them at some point. That's why it's so helpful to talk about family problems. By talking about the issues we're facing, we can work together to find solutions and strengthen our families stronger. Not only that but talking about family problems can also help to reduce the stigma around them. Too often, people feel they have to keep their family problems to themselves, but this only makes things more difficult. We can help make it easier for others to do the same by talking about these issues. If you're facing family problems, know that you're not alone. And don't be afraid to reach out for help. There are many resources available for families who are struggling. With the support, you can get through anything.</p><p>One of the most common types of family problems is communication problems. Those with communication problems often have a hard time communicating with each other. Effective communication is essential to resolving family problems. It allows family members to express their feelings and needs safely and respectfully. It also allows for compromise and negotiation. Without communication, family members can quickly be resentful and frustrated, leading to even more problems. Communication is key. When communication breaks down, problems can quickly escalate and become unmanageable. Of course, communication is not always effortless. It requires effort and patience. Family members may not always be willing to listen or to compromise. But even in the most challenging situations, communication is still the most effective way to resolve problems.</p><p>Another common type of family problem is financial problems. Families who have financial problems often have a hard time making ends meet. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Financial issues can also make it difficult for family members to save money for future expenses.</p><p>Addiction is another common type of family problem. Those with addiction problems often have a hard time dealing with their addiction. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Addiction can also make it difficult for family members to get the help they need to recover from their addiction. If one or more family members are struggling with addiction, it can create a ripple effect on the entire family. Mental health problems can also be complicated for families to deal with. When a family member struggles with depression, anxiety, or another mental health issue, it can be challenging for the rest of the family to understand and support them.</p><p>Abuse is another common type of family problem. Families who have abuse problems have a hard time dealing with it. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Abuse can also make it difficult for family members to get the help they need to stop the abuse.</p><p>These are only a few examples of family problems. No family is flawless. Every family has difficulties, and some families have more problems than others.</p><p>In conclusion, family problems are a common occurrence that can happen to anyone. While they can be hard to deal with, there are several ways to overcome them. By communicating openly with family members, seeking outside support, and making a concerted effort to work through the issue, it is possible to resolve family problems.</p><br />

</p><p>Why Families are Important?
</p><p>Families are a blessing not everyone is fortunate enough to have. However, those who do, sometimes do not value this blessing. Some people spend time away from the family in order to become independent.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, they do not realize its importance. Families are essential as they help in our growth. They develop us into becoming a complete person with an individual identity. Moreover, they give us a sense of security and a safe environment to flourish in.</p><p></p><p>Pillars of Strength
</p><p>My family has been always by my side in ups and downs. They have taught me how to be a better person. My family consists of four siblings and my parents. We also have a pet dog that is no less than our family.
</p><p>
</p><p>Within each family member, lies my strength. My mother is my strength as I can always count on her when I need a shoulder to cry on. She believes in me more than any other person. She is the backbone of our family. My father is someone who will always hide away his troubles for the sake of his family.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><br />
