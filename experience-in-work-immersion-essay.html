Specifically, the students are able to: (1) gain relevant and practical industrial skills under the guidance of industry experts and workers; (ii) appreciate the importance and application of the principles and theories taught in school, enhance their technical knowledge and skills; (iv) enrich their skills in communications and human relation; and (v) develop good work habits, attitudes, appreciation, and respect for work. These prepare them to meet the needs and challenges of employment or higher education after employment. Work Immersion provides the students with a venue to test themselves and apply what they have learned in a non-school scenario. The learners are not only able to apply their previous training but are also able to experience the social interactions in a work environment. Their experiences during work immersion will develop many skills and values that would help them as they transition from high school to real life.</p><p></p><p>To assure the achievement of the objectives of Work Immersion in the Philippines, the Department of Education issued DepEd Order No. 30, s. 2017 which serves as the basis in the implementation of work immersion in all Senior High Schools (SHSS). The policy serves to guide SHSS in: (i) creating flexible work immersion arrangement for their learners; (ii) providing options for work immersion that are relevant to learners' purposes and needs; (iii) organizing work immersion opportunities for learners that are consistent with the diverse human resource requirements for partner institutions for work immersion; and (iv) articulating the scope and limits of work immersion in the context of basic education when building relationships with work immersion partners. To assess the learners' performance during the Work Immersion, the Work Immersion Teacher and the Work Immersion Partner Institution Supervisor will jointly assess the learners' performance following DepEd Order No. 8, 2015.</p><p></p><p>As a Grade 12 student. I was given the chance to undergo the Work Immersion for a duration of two weeks. In preparation, I accomplished the needed requirements and documents first before I was qualified for the immersion. I was assigned to the Philippine National Police station. In our Work Immersion, I was able to experience the day-to-day activities of the PNP such as road checkpoint, flyer distribution, moral activity, community service, gun assembling, and earthquake drills. During this period, I learned a lot of things that helped me understand and appreciate the work of our police officers. I got first-hand experiences wherein I was able to apply and improve my prior knowledge and skills.</p><br />

                            13. what Is your experience during the pandemic as a work immersion?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2020 has been a challenging year for all of our students, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We’re especially proud of those students who were selfless enough to step up to the plate and give their time and energy to helping those in need during this crisis. One of those students is Carl Dowling, a BSc Paramedic Science student. Carl spent time with the London Ambulance Service and, this experience led to him writing his first research papers. He took some time to reflect on his experience and give an honest view of working on the front-line of a national crisis.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“At the start of the pandemic, I desperately felt the urge to help people in some way. This is why I became a paramedic student - one of many reasons why I chose this job was to help people in their time of need. So I decided to look for an opportunity to work directly to support the efforts against the virus. In April, I found the opportunity I was looking for to work with a private ambulance service in London. I was based at a hospital near Cambridge where I worked out of the Intensive Care Unit (A.K.A, the COVID-19 Ward).</p><p></p><p> My role was working as part of a team alongside specialists, doctors, nurses, HELIMED Crews (Air Ambulance) and anaesthetists. There was me single crewing one ambulance and two other teammates single crewing theirs. Our roles were to maintain the management and urgent transportation of COVID-19 patients who were severe or in a critical condition, as well as making sure they were ventilated/incubated and on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Along with this, we also had to maintain infection control standards before and after each patient. I would travel as part of a single crew to any hospital within the London area, meet a team on a COVID-19 ward, prepare the patient for transportation and bring them back to my base of operations where better care could be provided in a ward specifically for COVID-19 patients.</p><p></p><p>I tried my best not to have any pre-existing ideas about what it would be like working from a COVID-19 ward, especially assisting in the care of the patients, but the very first thing I saw when entering the ward was a patient in a body bag who had sadly passed away. This immediately gave me a sense of urgency about what it was that I had gotten myself into. It also caused one of my teammates to feel high levels of anxiety, however, this helped me deal with my own anxiety, as my main focus became helping that individual and reassuring them. </p><p></p><p>The first shift was difficult. There was no formal training involved, other than a tour of the base, parts of the equipment and a brief explanation. We just had to know how to use the appropriate PPE and when to dispose of it correctly. We also spent an hour after every patient deep cleaning the ambulance to prevent the spread of infection. My first transfer was to assist in the evacuation of one of the hospitals, due to a lack of oxygen.</p><p></p><p>The other two single crewed ambulances and I were deployed and we did what we could in terms of evacuating the hospital safely, but it wasn’t just a lack of time that was stressful, it was also the lack of equipment in terms of navigation systems, as they were unfortunately outdated and often would send us in the wrong direction. I had to use my phone’s navigation system on the majority of journeys. Control(ICU at our base of operations) were also not giving the most effective information so we weren’t always 100% sure where we had to be and how to get there. I changed this and created set questions that needed answering when giving us the details of a transfer, which worked better. </p><br />

NARRATIVE REPORT</h2><br />
                        Agriculture is one of our country’s primary economic source of income. Many Filipinos still and most farmers say, enjoying living in rural areas and supporting their families through agriculture. To mention, some of our main agricultural crops are rice, corn, bananas, pineapple, sugarcane, coconut, tobacco, mangoes, coffee and abaca. <br /><br /> To name a few of my unforgettable agricultural experiences during work immersion are the following: having a hard time selecting the variety of crop to be planted or cultured since our country has different climates. You have to select the appropriate crops for the present climate. <br />Having a good and continuous water supply or water irrigation is a must. There are crops that need less water while other crops grow healthily with plenty of water. Proper cultivation and right amount of fertilizer is vital. I remembered putting extra fertilizer to one of our pechay beds, with the thought the it will grow faster and greener, but sad to say all of our seedlings are withered when I checked them the following day. <br />You also need to consider proper ventilation. Some crops need a lot of sunshine while other crops prefer a shady location. Proper agriculture attire and tools are also a must to avoid accidents or unnecessary incident.<br /> Some people call it crazy but I do talk to my plants. I visit and ask them how they are as if I am talking to a friend. I am also asking them to grow fast and healthy. Sometimes we can not avoid bad weather condition, so I also include them to my prayers. And when harvest time arrives, I am whispering my gratefulness to them.<br />
