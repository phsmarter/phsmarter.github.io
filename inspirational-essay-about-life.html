                        <strong>SPEECH</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>Dear friends,</p><p></p><p>I am honored to speak to you today about inspiration in life. For me, inspiration comes from many sources, but most importantly, it comes from my family and friends.</p><p></p><p>My family has always been a constant source of support and love for me. From the moment I was born, they have been there for me, cheering me on and helping me through all of life's challenges. They have taught me the value of hard work and determination, and have instilled in me a sense of resilience and perseverance.</p><p></p><p>My friends have also been a source of inspiration for me. They have helped me to see the world in a different light, and have challenged me to think outside of the box. They have supported me through the highs and lows, and have always been there to lend an ear or a helping hand.</p><p></p><p>But my inspiration doesn't just come from those closest to me. It also comes from the world around me - from nature, from art, and from people who have overcome great challenges and achieved great things.</p><p></p><p>In short, my inspiration comes from all around me - from the people I love, from the world I live in, and from the dreams and goals that drive me forward.</p><p></p><p>I hope that, as you go through life, you too can find inspiration in the people and things that matter most to you. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear fellow students,</p><p></p><p>I stand before you today to talk about something that is incredibly important to me: the people who inspire me in my life. For me, that includes my family, my friends, and the mentors and role models I've had the privilege of encountering along the way.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, I am constantly inspired by my family. My parents have always been my biggest supporters and have taught me the value of hard work, determination, and unconditional love. I am also blessed to have siblings who push me to be the best version of myself and who have always been there for me through thick and thin.</p><p></p><p>My friends are also a constant source of inspiration for me. They have always been there to listen, to support, and to encourage me when I needed it the most. Whether we're laughing together, exploring new places, or simply having a heart-to-heart conversation, my friends bring joy and positivity into my life every single day.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I am grateful for the mentors and role models who have shaped me into the person I am today. These are the people who have challenged me, guided me, and believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself. They have taught me valuable lessons and helped me to see the world in new and different ways.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, my family, friends, and mentors are the people who inspire me the most in my life. They are the ones who have helped me to become the person I am today and who continue to push me to be the best that I can be. Thank you for being a part of my journey.</p><p></p><p>thank you </p><br />

                            13. what values that will inspires us about life of st. thomas aquinas</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The most important values that we can learn from <strong>St. Thomas Aquinas</strong> are <strong>faith and wisdom</strong>. He was known for combining theology (faith) and philosophy (reason) and he dedicated his life about explaining these through his writings.
</p><p>Before, people struggle to combine faith and reason. But St. Aquinas proved that faith is not blind following. But rather, faith and reason  are interconnected.  </p><p>According to Saint Thomas Aquinas, <strong>the existence of God could be proven in five ways:
</strong></p><p>1) observing movement in the world as proof of God, the "Immovable Mover”
</p><p>2) observing cause and effect and identifying God as the cause of everything
</p><p>3) concluding that the impermanent nature of beings proves the existence of a necessary being, God, who originates only from within himself
</p><p>4) noticing varying levels of human perfection and determining that a supreme, perfect being must therefore exist
</p><p>5) knowing that natural beings could not have intelligence without it being granted to them it by God. Subsequent to defending people's ability to naturally perceive proof of God, Thomas also tackled the challenge of protecting God's image as an all-powerful being

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Motivation Essay: Motivation is important in life because it helps us gain valued results like personal growth, better well-being, enhanced performance, or a sense of confidence. Motivation is a road to improve our way of feeling, thinking, and behaving. The advantages of motivation are seen in our way of living life. </p><p>Motivation is an essential factor that changes positive thought into instant action. It switches a great idea into action and can undoubtedly affect the world around you. However, not all are born with motivation. People sometimes have disbelief in themselves; they often say, “I can’t do that” or “the timing is not right.” Being demotivated means living a life as a worn-out machine. Your life will become dull without any spark. So, to gain inner peace and satisfaction in life, you must always stay motivated.</p><p></p><p>Motivation is a force to push you closer toward your dream. If Steve Jobs lacked the motivation to launch Apple, you would not get an iPhone or iPad. It gives you a purpose to live you with a forever smile on the face. Thus, realizing and working on your self-motivation skills will make you capable of taking control of different aspects of life.</p><p></p><p>The critical elements of self-motivation are resilience and optimism. The former will help you bounce back during difficult times, whereas later, you will show you a brighter side ahead. This way, you will be able to control your emotions that are holding you back. You need to locate the right motivation for you to get your spark back. You can find motivation from a wide range of effective sources, for example, from quotes, books, videos, parents, teachers, and even nature. Ultimately, you’ll learn rational thinking to overcome negative emotions when you are motivated in life.</p><p></p><p>Motivation also helps in making you active in life. You will struggle more to fulfill your goals. A self-motivated person always discovers a way to understand the issues hindering the path to complete a task. Moreover, they do not require other people’s support to accomplish a challenging task close to them.Hence, motivation is one of the vital factors to be successful in any phase of your life. Whether personal or professional events both demand a person to stay positive to achieve the goals. As a motivated person, you will always try to push your limits and develop your performance level every day.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, you will continuously thrive on giving your best during every task. You will see that you remain dedicated and progressive towards the objectives of life. Lastly, your dreams and goals will come true as you always aimed.</p><p>So, always stay motivated in life without losing hope. When you stay motivated each day, it’ll push you closer to your goals. Learn to remain calm when you go through any hard day. It’s an excellent habit and must be applied in life. As a result, all your negative thoughts will start fading away.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#Hope it's help </p><p>#CARY ON LEARNING </p><p>#stay safe </p><br />

Education lessens the challenges you will face in life. The more knowledge you gain the more opportunities will open up to allow individuals to achieve better possibilities in career and personal growth. Education has played an important role in the career world of the twenty-first century. A person with a higher education will be easily qualified compared to a person without an extended education; as one will be prepared to do various tasks that careers demand as well as meet job standards.</p><p></p><p>I also believe education is important because it helps us develop a unique perspective of looking at life. Education has played a major role for all individuals in the society. It has allowed the community to succeed both socially and economically by enabling it to develop common culture and values. Education is the reason our world is the way it is today, doctors have been close to finding cures for cancer because of a higher education; our technology has been enriched compared to the 19th century all because of education.</p><p></p><p>If the importance of education is not recognized, then someday education will become less relevant. Education serves to unite and strengthen our country. Without education people would not be able to distinguish right from wrong. If this should happen, then our society will find itself at a large disadvantage compared to other countries. “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” once said by a wise man name Nelson Mandela, and that is why I strongly agree why education is important.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>e Sulat mo nyang lahat ha , </p><p>goo</p><br />

                        <p><strong>My family is very inspiring to me. I am very thankful that my parents brought me into this world. Growing up my parents always showed me how exactly things work in life. One of the hardest things that I had to accept was that I could not have everything I wanted. There were times when my parents spoiled me but I was always taught to be thankful of the things that I had and to not be so selfish. Having two other siblings helped me prevent the want of being selfish. I do not know what I would do without my family. My family is very inspiring because they show me all aspects on how I should live my life through their experiences like education, parenting, and work ethic.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            28. Essay writing: inspiration in life?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> I believe that we all have inspirations in our lives, right? So at this moment I would like everyone to remember or think about someone who inspires you to get up every morning and motivates you to go to school. Now, I think everyone would agree that our inspirations are the source of our positivity when we are down, they are the ones who motivates us to do what we love to do, and the reason why we keep believing in ourselves. II. "Irreplaceable" a word that defines my family, friends, and my culture. They were my main inspirations in life who kept my feet in track whenever I started slipping out, who became my source of energy and who helped me become who I am today. My family means everything I am the eldest child and I have been held responsible for everything that my parents tell us to do. My parents always had a high expectation from me and they hoped that I will be a good role model to my siblings. The responsibilities that were given to me gave me the opportunity to build a great relationship with my siblings, and as well gave me the chance to grow maturely at a very young age. I am very thankful to be blessed with such a loving family, and I know that they will continue to inspire me wherever life brings.</p><p>My friends and I are very close that we consider each other like siblings. I always feel that my day would not be complete without seeing them. Growing in a third world country during my childhood days was like living in place without electricity, In fact we do actually experience power outage all the time. Everything is all basic we do not have any electronic devices for games like play stations, game boys and all that stuff. But we still manage to enjoy playing with each other by inventing our own games. In that way we learned to appreciate what we have and we feel blessed that we can have fun even in a simple way. My friends and I really cared for each other. We were very open to each other and we are always there to comfort or give advice to someone who is going through a tough time in life. The love and care that we have build for each other lead us to create a greater bond , and most of all a trust that would last forever.</p><p>My inspirations in life?, my family and friends, my family were always there to take care of me everyday, my friends make me happy whenever i'm not okay, they also listen to my dramas or whenever I open up to them, my family and friends are both really important to me, they mean a lot to me, and I don't want to leave them, I don't want them to leave me either.</p><br />

                        <p>Wherever it proceeded, Buddhism altered how societies were arranged. It questioned hierarchy, created freedom for daughters, and present things of all classes a role in otherworldly practice. But as Buddhism altered each new institution it crazy, so too acted Buddhism change.Buddhism is individual of the globe's largest religions and introduced 2,500 time gone by in India. Buddhists trust that the human growth is one of agony, what contemplation, religious and physical labor, and courtesy are the habits to obtain understanding, or nirvana.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

                        <p>Families are an integral part of one's life. It does not matter if you have a small or big family, as long as you have one. A family serves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things.
