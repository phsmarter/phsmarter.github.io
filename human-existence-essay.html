1.
Animal testing has benefited
human health. People do not
contract polio anymore because
of a vaccine tested on animals.
Advances in antibiotics, insulin,
and other drugs have been made
possible through research done
on animals. Animal testing
should continue to benefit
medical research.
1.__________
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.
Drug testing using animals became
important in the twentieth century. In 1937,
a pharmaceutical company in the USA
created a preparation of sulfanilamide, using
diethylene glycol (DEG) as a solvent, and
called the preparation 'Elixir Sulfanilamide'.
DEG was poisonous to humans, but the
company's chief pharmacist and chemist
was not aware of this. He simply added
raspberry flavoring to the sulfa drug, which
he had dissolved in DEG, and the company
marketed the product. The preparation led
to mass poisoning causing the deaths of
more than a hundred people. No animal
testing was done. The public outcry caused
by this incident and other similar disasters
led to the passing of the 1938 Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act requiring safety
testing of drugs on animals before they could
be marketed.
2.__________

3.
Medical research involving animals
has dramatically improved the health
of the human race. Without animal
testing, the cure for polio would not
exist and diabetics would suffer or die
from their disease. Despite these
benefits, some people believe that
animals should be not be used for
testing medical techniques and drugs.
This essay will outline the advantages
of animal testing.

This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</a>

SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines.

                                            “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.

                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Every tree that we see around us was a tiny plant some years ago. The countless benefits of plants cannot be neglected. They are the main source of food for all living beings. </p><p></p><p>They may not depend on us but our lives depend on them for sure.There are more than 300 thousand species of plants on this planet. </p><p></p><p>When a plant grows, it makes the area around it greener and beautiful. It is a fact that people who live closer to greenery are healthier and happier than people who do not live near greenery. </p><p></p><p>A plant has around 95% of water.Plants need water, soil and sunlight for their survival. They will die in absence of these things. </p><p></p><p>They have a waxy layer of their surface to prevent them from drying out. They prepare their own food in the presence of sunlight by a process called ‘photosynthesis’. </p><p></p><p>There is a pigment in plants to give them green color which is called ‘chlorophyll’. They also have a well-developed metabolic system which includes anabolism as well as catabolism.</p><p></p><p>The importance of plants in our life is inexhaustible. They are very important for survival of every specie living on Earth. They provide us food, shelter, habitat and medicines.</p><p></p><p>Just a single tree can provide food and shelter to many species like insects, birds and reptiles.These green plants produce food for all organisms and these foods are rich in vitamins and carbohydrates that are necessary for our health.</p><p></p><p>We get clean water because of plants. They move water from soil to atmosphere through a process called transpiration.</p><p></p><p>Without plants, our water cycle will be disrupted and our oxygen supply will be cut short because they improve oxygen level and reduce carbon dioxide level. In short, we will not be able to survive without plants.</p><p></p><p>Plants maintain balance in ecosystem.They also help to purify the air that we breathe. They help to fight global warming by maintaining the global temperature to save us from scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>They also cool down the air as they lose moisture and reflect heat upward through their leaves. They maintain a balance in temperature by reflecting harmful radiations of sun.They play an important role to convert carbon dioxide to oxygen through a process called ‘photosynthesis’.</p><p></p><p>So, more trees mean more oxygen and less carbon dioxide in atmosphere.If there are less plants that means there will be more carbon dioxide in air and with more CO2, more of sun’s radiations will be reflected to earth, instead of space.</p><p></p><p>These radiations will cause our average temperature to rise. As a result, the oceans will be warmer and at some point, we will all fry to death.</p><p></p><p>The importance of plants is not just limited to being a source of food or oxygen. Plants are also used for various medicinal purposes.</p><p></p><p>These medicines are safer because of lower side effects. There is a therapy called herbal therapy that is one of the oldest types of treatments this world has ever known. Herbal remedies have proven to be genuine and more effective.</p><p></p><p>Plants are very important for survival of living beings. It is because of plants that we breathe fresh air. It is our responsibility to take care of plants because our lives depend on their survival.</p><p></p><p>Without them, every specie will die because of lack of oxygen on planet. Unfortunately, people cut down these trees to make furniture and other wooden materials.</p><p></p><p>We need to understand that plants also have a life. Therefore, it is very important to have awareness about plants and taking necessary measures to promotes tree plantation.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps,</p><p>Godbless</p><br />

Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actualwords?Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, itcan literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms likelanguage and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense,human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company ofothers to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness canbe found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships.

1.
Animal testing has benefited
human health. People do not
contract polio anymore because
of a vaccine tested on animals.
Advances in antibiotics, insulin,
and other drugs have been made
possible through research done
on animals. Animal testing
should continue to benefit
medical research.
1.__________
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.
Drug testing using animals became
important in the twentieth century. In 1937,
a pharmaceutical company in the USA
created a preparation of sulfanilamide, using
diethylene glycol (DEG) as a solvent, and
called the preparation 'Elixir Sulfanilamide'.
DEG was poisonous to humans, but the
company's chief pharmacist and chemist
was not aware of this. He simply added
raspberry flavoring to the sulfa drug, which
he had dissolved in DEG, and the company
marketed the product. The preparation led
to mass poisoning causing the deaths of
more than a hundred people. No animal
testing was done. The public outcry caused
by this incident and other similar disasters
led to the passing of the 1938 Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act requiring safety
testing of drugs on animals before they could
be marketed.
2.__________
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
3.
Medical research involving animals
has dramatically improved the health
of the human race. Without animal
testing, the cure for polio would not
exist and diabetics would suffer or die
from their disease. Despite these
benefits, some people believe that
animals should be not be used for
testing medical techniques and drugs.
This essay will outline the advantages
of animal testing.

                            11. Directions: Read and reflect on the short essay then answer the guide questions on a separate sheet of paper.          Man as a Social Animal        By Ma. Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Yes, I believe that man is a social animal because humans have a natural instinct to live in society with other human beings.</p><p></p><p>2. Man becomes a social animal by forming social groups with common interests and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background, and other personal qualities.</p><p></p><p>3. Human interaction is very important in building a nation because it helps people form social groups that can work together towards common goals.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Meeting the every-citizen interface (ECI) criteria described in Chapter 2 will require advances in a number of technology areas. Some involve advances in basic underlying display and interface technologies (higher-resolution visual displays, three-dimensional displays, better voice recognition, better tactile displays, and so on). Others involve advances in our understanding of how to best match these input/output technologies to the sensory, motor, and cognitive capabilities of different users in different and changing environments carrying out a wide variety of tasks. But the new interfaces will need to do more than just physically couple the user to the devices. To meet these visions, the interfaces must have the ability to assist, facilitate, and collaborate with the user in accomplishing tasks.</p><p></p><p>Subsequent chapters address interface design-the creation of interfaces that make the best-possible use of these human-machine communications technologies-and system attributes that lie beneath the veneer of the interface, such as system intelligence and software support for collaborative activities. This chapter examines the current state and prospective advances in technology areas related directly to communication between a person and a system-hardware and software for input (to the system) and output (to a human). The emphasis is on technical advances that, if implemented in well-designed systems (as stressed in Chapter 4), hold the potential to expand accessibility and usability to many more people than at present. The discussion includes a cluster of speech input/output technologies; natural language understanding (including restricted languages with limited vocabularies); keyboard input; gesture recognition</p><p></p><p>Page 72</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            18. An Ideal Citizen 1. A citizen is a person who lives in a state and is governed by its laws in all matters. An ideal citizen is an asset to a nation. Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?

Essay on Education By: Priyanka Nagrale Countless words are written daily about the importance of education. Indubitably, education is the only valuable asset humans can achieve. Human evolution over eons is a result of education both formal and informal. Further, education is the sole basis on which the future of the human race depends. Our quest for knowledge is unending and will continue till planet Earth exists. How did you find the new information you have learned? I hope that you now pay attention to the basic elements of a position paper. Prepare to examine one in the next activities. Good Luck! Everyone speaks about education and its importance. Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</h2><br />

                            23. “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. According to the essay, the basis of national strength is the character of its citizenry. The author believes that a nation cannot be stronger than its parts, and its weakness is its failings, while its strength is its power. I partially agree with this statement because the citizenry's character is a crucial factor in a nation's strength, but it is not the only one. Factors such as the government, economy, and social structures contribute to a nation's strength.</p><p></p><p>2. The peaks, valleys, and deep chasms that could hinder the upward climb of humanity are the obstacles that prevent people from realizing their full potential, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, and conflicts. These obstacles hinder progress and development, requiring potent social upheavals.</p><p></p><p>3. The author wants the Filipinos to be solid and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning, or the storm, and confident of their strength. The author also wants the Filipino to be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited, and imbued with good patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness. I believe this goal can be achieved with proper education, training, and social support.</p><p></p><p>4. To achieve the author's perceived goal, we must possess self-discipline, courage, industry, self-reliance, purposefulness, patriotism, social ideals, and solid moral fibers. These values will enable us to develop our resources, advance our culture, promote social justice, and secure happiness and contentment for all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Power has also been shown to affect the experience of emotions. For instance, research suggests that people who lack power become more attuned to others' emotions, especially when living in the same physical space. Powerful individuals, on the other hand, tend to pay less attention to the emotions of others.</p><br />

                            26. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent. Giving respect to others is a way of exercising and multiplying our quality of respect, which will inevitably earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, giving respect to all individuals is crucial, and it is an innate quality that we possess. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others, and it helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others. By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />
