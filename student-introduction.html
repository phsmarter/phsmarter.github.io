</p><p></p><p>Absenteeism <strong>results in poor academic performance</strong> among students.  According to a recent study, higher percentage of students have reached significant records of absenteeism.  This pattern has become <strong>detrimental</strong> among students because they are more engaged with interacting with peer influences and problematic behaviors.
</p><p></p><p>Students who seem to have lapses on absenteeism have experienced dysfunctional families, and possess low value or regard with their life.  Such misbehavior can lead to a bigger problem when this is not addressed accordingly.

</p><p>
</p>peer pressure
drugs
family problems
economic status
<p>
</p><p>These young adults are sometimes misled and pushed to try such things as a <strong>way of their escape to reality or to fit in with a group that requires such activities that can exploit their childhood and innocence</strong>. In line with this problem, the increased rate of teenage pregnancy and abortion soared high in our society. We can lessen the incidence of these things if we can guide them through <strong>family support, proper sex education, counseling, and youth engaging programs from the government</strong><strong>.

However, being able to read is not enough to be successful. Hence, reading must always be coupled with comprehension. Students, most especially, in order to excel in the new face of curriculum which is the K12 Curriculum, must give time and extra effort in honing their skill of understanding different texts and topics presented to them</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The study of the psychological needs of students is an important area of research in the field of education. This topic has gained increasing attention in recent years due to the growing recognition that students’ psychological well-being is a key factor in their academic success. In order to achieve academic success, students need to feel motivated, engaged, and supported. In this regard, the psychological needs of students play a critical role in shaping their learning experiences and outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Several studies have examined the psychological needs of students and their impact on academic performance. These studies have identified various psychological needs that are essential for students’ success, such as the need for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and mastery. Students who have these needs met are more likely to be engaged in their learning and to perform well academically.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the psychological needs of students is important for educators and policymakers in designing effective educational programs and policies. By addressing students’ psychological needs, educators can create a positive and supportive learning environment that promotes student success. This study aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the psychological needs of students by examining the experiences of students in a specific context.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>“It’s now painfully clear that schools ought to have had more robust disaster-preparedness plans in place in the event of interruptions in their campus operations. But because many schools did not have such plans in place…online learning is about to get a bad reputation at many campuses, I suspect.” Michael Horn, cited in Lederman (2020), ‘Inside Higher Ed’ </p><p></p><p>Research regarding online learning and teaching shows that they are effective only if students have consistent access to the internet and computers and if teachers have received targeted training and supports for online instruction. Because these needed requirements for effectiveness have been largely absent for many, remote education during the pandemic has impeded teaching and learning.</p><p>Research on home schooling shows that it works well for students for whom intentional, personalized, and sufficient resources are available. The crisis-induced delivery of home schooling without time for planning around children’s learning styles and circumstances means that many children home schooled during the pandemic are not replicating such model and thus not reaping the associated benefits.</p><p>Reduced learning time has likely impeded student learning and also affected the development of the whole child. Once the pandemic allows it, we will need to make up for this time by increasing both the amount and quality of learning time—through extended schedules, summer enrichment and after-school activities, more personalized instruction, and staffing strategies that reduce class sizes and staff schools with sufficient and highly credentialed educators.</p><p>Research on chronic absenteeism and on remote learning reinforces the urgency of providing appropriate support to children who are least prepared and especially to those at risk of becoming disengaged and eventually dropping out.</p><p>Research on summer learning (loss or gain) points to the importance of personalized instruction. The research shows that learning styles and outcomes vary greatly, and that the outcomes are a function of the educational resources that families and systems provide to children across the year and of a large number of factors and circumstances that shape children’s learning and development.</p><p>Research shows that a lack of contingency planning exacerbates the negative impacts of recessions, natural disasters, and pandemics on learning. Contingency planning thus needs to be institutionalized and include emergency funding to replenish the resources drained during emergencies.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>for more info https://www.epi.org/publication/the-consequences-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-for-education-performance-and-equity-in-the-united-states-what-can-we-learn-from-pre-pandemic-research-to-inform-relief-recovery-and-rebuilding/ </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>The psychological needs of students have been the subject of significant research in the field of psychology. Understanding these needs is crucial for educators and parents to provide an environment that fosters learning and growth. This study aims to explore the psychological needs of students and their impact on academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Psychological needs are the basic requirements that individuals must fulfill to achieve optimal psychological functioning. In the context of students, psychological needs refer to the fundamental needs that students require to feel motivated, engaged, and successful in their academic pursuits. The three primary psychological needs identified by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) are autonomy, competence, and relatedness.</p><p></p><p>Autonomy refers to the need for students to feel in control of their learning and to have a sense of choice and volition. Competence refers to the need for students to feel capable and effective in their academic pursuits. Relatedness refers to the need for students to feel connected and valued by others, particularly peers and teachers.</p><p></p><p>Research has shown that satisfying these psychological needs is essential for students to thrive academically and psychologically. Students who feel a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are more likely to be intrinsically motivated and engaged in their learning, leading to higher academic performance and better mental health outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, when students' psychological needs are not met, they may experience negative outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and disengagement from school. For example, students who feel a lack of autonomy may feel disengaged and unmotivated, while those who feel a lack of competence may experience anxiety and self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the psychological needs of students is essential for creating a positive learning environment that promotes academic success and overall well-being. By satisfying students' autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, educators and parents can help students achieve their full potential and lead fulfilling lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
