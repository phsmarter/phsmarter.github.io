A recent report by the Centre for Economic Performance and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (both at LSE) emphasises the importance of involving businesses and communities in developing a strategy for inclusive and sustainable recovery. A “better” post-recovery world will undoubtedly also benefit from the well-documented contributions that social sciences make in areas such as improving the resilience of our democracies and financial systems, exposing and addressing social and economic inequalities, and promoting good mental health and more sustainable ways of living.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>I'm</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sorry</strong><strong> </strong><strong>kung</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ito</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lang</strong><strong> </strong><strong>muna</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pero</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hanapan</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>yung</strong><strong> </strong><strong>iba</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pedeng</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong> </strong><strong>comment</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lang</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
