                                            Text: Self-discipline refers to the training that one gives one's self to accomplish a certain task or to adopt a particular pattern of behaviour although one would really rather be doing something else. For example, denying oneself of one's favourite cheesecake that is high in calories for an oat biscuit On the other hand, willpower is the ability to overcome laziness and procrastination. It is the ability to control or reject harmful impulses. It is also the ability to arrive to a decision and follow through with it with perseverance until its successful accomplishment Willpower gets stronger by holding back and not allowing the expression of unimportant, unnecessary and unhealthy thoughts feelings, actions and reactions. If this saved energy is not allowed expression, it is stored inside you like a battery and becomes available at the time of need. In fact, it is one of the corner stones of success, both spiritual and material. Self-discipline is the companion of will power. It is the assertion of willpower over more base desires. To some extent, it acts as a substitute for motivation, when one uses reason to determine a best course of action that opposes one's desires. It endows us with , the stamina to persevere in whatever one does. It bestows the ability to withstand hardships and difficulties, whether physical, emotional or mental. Willpower and self-discipline help us to choose our behaviour and reactions instead of being ruled by them With their possession, you will feel in charge of yourself and your surroundings. As such, you are bound to feel happy and satisfied.​ PA HELP PA SUMMARIZE LANG PO</a>

                                            The interaction between the Self and the other is related to the philosophical concept of intersubjectivity Similar to the word interpersonal, the word intersubjectivity is also comprise of three groups of letters and/or words, namely a inter = again this is a prefix which means 'between b subject = this refers to a person or thing that is being discussed with city = a suffix used to form nouns which expresses state or condition From this, we can conclude that intersubjectivity means a condition of relationship between subjects or persons. If I relate with a friend for example, and he or she relates back to me, intersubjectivity occurs Philosophically, this means that when the Self recognizes the Other and the other recognizes the Self, intersubjectivity happens. To further get its meaning, study the excerpt from the song. Awitin Mo at Isasayaw ko by VST &amp; Co., below.

Analytical tradition is an important tool toward freedom and truth.5.Discipline and responsibility should be taught especially through education.6. According to determinism human choices and actions are like all other events in the universe,in so far as a cause that is ultimately outside of nature (for example,God or fate)and therefore cannot be affected by human behavior.7. Positive freedom is freedom from fear of being attacked.8. For Skinner,holding someone responsible for an action means reinforcing desirable behavior-not as a reward for past actions but to cause someone to act and desirable ways in the future .9. Human behavior can be explained in terms of either that causes of actions or why the action is done.10.

                            10. Text: Self-discipline refers to the training that one gives one's self to accomplish a certain task or to adopt a particular pattern of behaviour although one would really rather be doing something else. For example, denying oneself of one's favourite cheesecake that is high in calories for an oat biscuit On the other hand, willpower is the ability to overcome laziness and procrastination. It is the ability to control or reject harmful impulses. It is also the ability to arrive to a decision and follow through with it with perseverance until its successful accomplishment Willpower gets stronger by holding back and not allowing the expression of unimportant, unnecessary and unhealthy thoughts feelings, actions and reactions. If this saved energy is not allowed expression, it is stored inside you like a battery and becomes available at the time of need. In fact, it is one of the corner stones of success, both spiritual and material. Self-discipline is the companion of will power. It is the assertion of willpower over more base desires. To some extent, it acts as a substitute for motivation, when one uses reason to determine a best course of action that opposes one's desires. It endows us with , the stamina to persevere in whatever one does. It bestows the ability to withstand hardships and difficulties, whether physical, emotional or mental. Willpower and self-discipline help us to choose our behaviour and reactions instead of being ruled by them With their possession, you will feel in charge of yourself and your surroundings. As such, you are bound to feel happy and satisfied.​ PA HELP PA SUMMARIZE LANG PO</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-discipline involves training that one gives oneself to perform a specific activity or to adopt a specific pattern of behavior even though one would rather be doing something else. For example, foregoing a high-calorie cheesecake in favor of an oat biscuit. Willpower, on the other hand, is the ability to overcome lethargy and procrastination. It refers to the ability to resist or control harmful urges. It is also the ability to make a decision and stick to it until it is completed successfully. Willpower grows stronger by resisting the expression of trivial, unnecessary, and unhealthy thoughts, feelings, actions, and reactions.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Willpower and self-discipline allow us to choose our behavior and reactions rather than being governed by them. With these, you will feel in control of yourself and your environment. As a result, you will undoubtedly be content and joyful.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. What is fill handle? How does fill handle cursor appears? Explain your answer.</strong></p><p>- Excel's fill handle is a small rectangular control that appears whenever a cell or range of cells are selected.Notice that when your cursor is in the cell, in the lower right corner of the cell a small black square appears; that's called a fill handle. If you carefully move the mouse cursor over the fill handle, it changes to a small black plus sign (called crosshairs).</p><p><strong>2.How does fill handle help you in making your work easier in excel? Cite an example.</strong></p><p>- Fill Handle is a feature in Excel that enables you to auto-complete a list in a row/column by simply dragging it using your mouse. A basic understanding of fill handle in Excel could save you some time and make you more productive.</p><p><strong>3. Determine the difference between auto filter and Flash fill? Are there instances that they are similar? How?</strong></p><p>- Excel Autofilter is an easy way to turn the values in excel columns into specific filters based on the cell content, While, Flash Fill automatically fills your data when it senses a pattern. Yes, there are instances that they are similar through how they work , but, Flash Fill is a smarter tool: It has the capability to foresee which adjustments within a pattern the user is attempting to make within a spreadsheet.</p><p><strong>4. In which tab will you find, the find and replace command? Draw the icon of the Find and replace command separately and explain the function of each.</strong></p><p>- To use Find and Replace, use the shortcut Ctrl+H or navigate to Editing in the Home tab of the ribbon, then choose Replace.</p><p><strong>5. How does using the find and replace command helps you in making your work easier in excel? Cite an example that will support your answer.​</strong></p><p>- At times, you may discover that you've repeatedly made a mistake throughout your workbook (such as misspelling someone's name) or that you need to exchange a particular word or phrase for another. You can use Excel's Find and Replace feature to make quick revisions.</p><p>Hope it Helps...</p><br />

                            19. The interaction between the Self and the other is related to the philosophical concept of intersubjectivity Similar to the word interpersonal, the word intersubjectivity is also comprise of three groups of letters and/or words, namely a inter = again this is a prefix which means 'between b subject = this refers to a person or thing that is being discussed with city = a suffix used to form nouns which expresses state or condition From this, we can conclude that intersubjectivity means a condition of relationship between subjects or persons. If I relate with a friend for example, and he or she relates back to me, intersubjectivity occurs Philosophically, this means that when the Self recognizes the Other and the other recognizes the Self, intersubjectivity happens.
