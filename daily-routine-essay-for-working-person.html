                            12. why supply chain important in our lifehow supply chain work in our daily routine ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Supply chains are the central nervous system of the economy, and in aggregate underpin the advanced lifestyle that we enjoy in Western nations. Developing nations are still a work in progress in this respect. Yet apart from the very physical manifestations we see each and every day, such as transportation on our roads, rail, sea and in the air, most consumers are oblivious to the extent to which they depend on supply chains in sustaining their everyday way of life.</p><p></p><p>The great post-World War II movement toward globalization has brought great wealth and improved lifestyles to millions of people, mostly through the efficiencies gained via smoother cross-border trade. All that is now in danger of stalling with the recent trend toward nationalism as evidenced by Trump’s regressive trade policies and the uncertainties brought on by Brexit in Europe.</p><p></p><p>At this point in history, those charged with designing and managing the supply chains of the future must find ways to counter these negative influences, for the sake of humanity and progress in general. The spotlight is squarely on national and international supply chains, and how they can adapt to intensified disruption in the operating environment.</p><p></p><p>Where to start the reinvention?</p><p>Supply chains (then called by the more restrictive term physical distribution), as a field of scientific endeavour, first emerged in the mid-1960s. For the ensuing 35 years, supply chain designs were dominated by “inside-out” thinking, where customer expectations were assumed at best – and we built our supply chain infrastructure according to what we thought best for the company first, and customers second. Efficiency and cost-saving mindsets prevailed, and very little imagination came into play. And as a result, customer satisfaction levels in this era languished as a general rule, across most if not all industries and geographies.</p><p></p><p>With the dawning of the online e-commerce era in the first decade of the 21st century, things changed very rapidly as customers and consumers, long taken for granted, began to exert their influence through social media and other means. The clever companies knew then that they had to change their ways and start redesigning their supply chains, from “outside-in.” The trick was to find a way to interpret and predict what customers were really thinking deep down and convert this knowledge into matching value propositions. We called this condition Dynamic Alignment™, and we have been working and refining it in the field since 1989. Not only does it help reduce cost-to-serve, but through the additional customer satisfaction that it delivers in parallel, it has a positive impact on revenues as well. Hallelujah!</p><p></p><p>The best-of-the-best global companies (such as the leading industrial Schneider Electric), have since adopted the overarching principle of dynamically aligning their business with customers and consumers in the target market. This has driven the realization that the previous design principle of “one-size-fits-all” was flawed, and that approach has since been replaced with multiple segments (ideally five) and an equivalent number of supply chain configurations – the result being up to 80% coverage in any given product-market situation. This is a huge improvement over the 20%-30% percent alignment achieved under the previous regime. In those days, it was the exceptions that drove up costs! This unique discovery of the ideal number of customer segments and matching supply chains is depicted in the diagram below.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>P</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>W</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>R</strong><strong> </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>S</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It can sound counter-intuitive but developing a daily routine can help us to feel more in control of everything, and help us to make room for all that's important. Routine can aid our mental health. It can help us to cope with change, to form healthy habits, and to reduce our stress levels. Having daily habits helps to organize your time during the day because you're following a specific pattern of activities. ... Hence, being able to appropriately allocate time to them is very important. It's a good idea to use time tracking to know exactly how much time you spend on each activity.</p><p></p><br />

Moreover, individuals use mathematics to calculate taxes, including income tax, sales tax, and property tax.<br /><br />In terms of future professions, mathematics is essential in many fields, including science, engineering, finance, and information technology. In science, mathematics is used to develop and test hypotheses, analyze data, and create models that explain natural phenomena. In engineering, mathematics is used to design and build structures, machines, and systems that are safe, efficient, and effective. In finance, mathematics is used to analyze financial data, create models, and make informed investment decisions. In information technology, mathematics is used to develop algorithms, analyze data, and create software programs.<br /><br />In conclusion, mathematics is a subject that plays a significant role in daily life and professional careers. It is a tool that helps individuals make informed decisions, solve problems, and understand the world around them. Whether it is calculating the cost of groceries, creating a budget, designing a building, or analyzing financial data, mathematics is an essential skill that everyone should learn and master.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Interviewee:</p><p></p><p>My daily exercise routine usually consists of stretching, running, and shooting drills. I always start my routine with a few minutes of stretching to warm up my muscles and get them ready for the exercises ahead. Then I typically do a few laps around the court to get my heart rate up and get my body ready for the drills. After that, I practice shooting drills that focus on accuracy, form, and quickness. Finally, I finish off with some agility and core exercises to help improve my balance and give me an extra edge on the court.</p><p></p><p>The things needed for my daily routine exercises are a basketball, a court, and some basic equipment like cones, ladders, and jump ropes. When it comes to displaying the exercises, I usually practice by myself and focus on the drill at hand. I like to set goals for myself and track my progress as I move forward with my routine.</p><p></p><p>The value of my daily routine exercise regime is twofold. First, it helps improve my performance on the court. By doing the drills every day, I am able to stay in shape and work on my skills so I can be as competitive as possible when I am playing in a game.

So many of us have been sheltering at home, some of us without jobs, others trying to help our kids learn at a distance, all of us wishing for positive news giving us a date for when things will be back to normal.</p><p></p><p>Even though there are reasons to be optimistic, we are still a long way from our lives returning to the way things were before COVID-19. Coming up with a routine or a regular schedule for your life is more important than ever. It can help you and your family deal with uncertainty and put you in the best position for whatever comes next.</p><p></p><p>Why Have a Routine?</p><p>Section 1</p><p></p><p>Humans are naturally hard-wired to crave stability and dependability. Our brains and our bodies perform better if we can follow a regular schedule. At first, it may feel fun or relaxing to have a lot of free time that you can use however you want – especially if you have a job you can no longer go to and other responsibilities that have shifted.</p><p></p><p>However, the decisions you make about how to spend your time cause stress. Do I go to the market or wait another day? What time should I wake up the kids? Should I look for jobs online, or should I watch TV? When should I start cooking dinner?</p><p></p><p>Without a routine, during a single day, you could be making hundreds of decisions, and the stress and anxiety will add up. Building a routine can take this pressure off and sticking to a routine can help boost your self-confidence.</p><br />
