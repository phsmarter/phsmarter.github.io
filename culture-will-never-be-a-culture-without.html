                                            Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</a>

                                            Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if not.PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT 1.  During puberty, teenagers are struggling with wanting to be accepted and with trying to fit in with their peers.2.  As we grow old, we become conscious with the different changes happen with our bodies.3.  Because of the raging hormones, the moods of the teenagers fluctuate between excitement, anger, anxiety, and depression.4.  As our hormones change, we begin to see the opposite sex in a different light and begin to experience sexual arousal.5.  Sigmund Freud was interested in how social interaction and relationship played a role in the development and growth of human beings.6.  There is no conflict during the puberty stage.7.  Erikson believed that people experience a conflict that serves as a turning point in development.8.  If people successfully deal with the conflict, they become strong in facing their challenges.9.  Identity diffusion is a status that characterizes those who have neither explored the options, nor made a commitment to identity.10.  Identity foreclosure is a status that characterizes those who have made a commitment to an identity without having explored the options.11.  Identity achievement is a status that describes those who are activity exploring in an attempt to establish an identity, but have yet to have made any commitment.12.  Identity moratorium refers to those who after exploration have made a commitment.13.  A great deal of the identity work we do in adolescence and young adulthood is about values and goals.14.  The religious views of teens are often similar to the views of their families.15.  The political ideology of teens is also influenced by their parent political beliefs.16.  The gender identity of the teens is one of the top issues now a days.17.  Unexamined Ethnic identity is never characterized with a preference for the dominant culture.18.  Ethnic identity may lead to a rejection of the values of the dominant culture.19.  Progress in achieved Ethnic identity if we have a deeper appreciation and understanding of their ethnic heritage.20.  Ethnic minorities should embrace the identity of their society and their families.21.  Adolescence is a period that is full of challenges.22.  Parents should play a highly supportive role to make their children better in the future.23.  All teenagers want to follow the footsteps of their parents.24.  All teenagers never challenge the authority of their parents.25.  When parents understand the process of adolescent sexual development, they are in a better position to assist their children.26.  Ages 12 to 15 are the age of curiosity and experimentation.27.  Teenagers need to feel a sense of belonging to feel good about their own identity.28.  Positive groups can help us to build healthy emotional and psychological development.29.  Teens never need to feel a sense of belonging to feel good about who they are.30.  Teenagers need to feel a deep sense of belonging in their family.31.  Teenagers who do not feel a sense of belonging from family and friends will pursue intimacy in unhealthy ways.32.  Parents must give their children the opportunity to make some decisions independently for their own stuff.33.  Teenagers with low self-esteem are at risk of being bullied, engaged with drugs and alcohol, and have suicidal thoughts.​</a>

Have you ever seen a mouse or rat in or around your home? If so, you may have a rodent infestation. Mice and rats are considered pests since they steal food from people.

Also, cats clean themselves while dogs need occasional baths. If you prefer a pet that requires more attention, you may be a dog person. Most dogs are very loyal and obedient. Dogs will also alert you when someone is outside of your home, whereas cats will usually just stay quiet. Both cats and dogs like to be petted, and they both make excellent pets.a. Bubble Map b.

Despite the important structural and cultural differences, both bacteria and viruses can cause disease in similar ways: they invade and multiply within the host by evading the immune system. Viruses are tinier than bactería. All viruses have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. Also, unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack.a. Bubble Map b. Events Chainc.

                                            The “Miss Saigon” musical stage play premiered in 1991 with the highest advance ticket sales ever. By end 2000, over 70 million people from 10 countries have seen the show which earned some $1.3 billion. Miss Saigon then came to the Philippine on October 2000 for a 6-month run at the Cultural Center of the Philippines casting the original female lead actress, Ms. Lea Salonga playing the role of Kim (she won a Tony award for her performance as “Kim” in the original show in the United States). In the Philippine run, Lea Salonga was the main attraction. Those who have never seen the show and even those who watched the play abroad came to watch her. Lea Salonga performed to a full house until Christmas eve of 2000 when alternates Ces Campos (who also played Kim in other countries) and understudy Ima Castro took over the role of Kim.
Early on, it was acknowledged that the alternate of Lea Salonga are not well known and may have a tough time living up to the public’s expectations. Thus, ticket sales may suffer. In the past, shows abroad without Lea Salonga were able to stand on their own. Skeptics, however, were saying that the situation is different because the Philippines is Lea’s home country.
You are tasked with marketing Ms. Saigon. What exactly will you do to ensure an equally filled main theater of the Cultural Center of the Philippines during the time when the alternates take over the lead role?</a>

Despite the important structural and cultural differences, both bacteria and viruses can cause disease in similar ways: they invade and multiply within the host by evading the immune system. Viruses are tinier than bacteria. All viruses have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. Also, unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack. A. Bubble MapB. Events ChainC.

                                            CASE STUDY ANALYSIS. Scenario: The “Miss Saigon” musical stage play premiered in 1991 with the highest advance ticket sales ever. By end 2000, over 70 million people from 10 countries have seen the show which earned some $1.3 billion. Miss Saigon then came to the Philippine on October 2000 for a 6-month run at the Cultural Center of the Philippines casting the original female lead actress, Ms. Lea Salonga playing the role of Kim (she won a Tony award for her performance as “Kim” in the original show in the United States). In the Philippine run, Lea Salonga was the main attraction. Those who have never seen the show and even those who watched the play abroad came to watch her. Lea Salonga performed to a full house until Christmas eve of 2000 when alternates Ces Campos (who also played Kim in other countries) and understudy Ima Castro took over the role of Kim. Early on, it was acknowledged that the alternate of Lea Salonga are not well known and may have a tough time living up to the public’s expectations. Thus, ticket sales may suffer. In the past, shows abroad without Lea Salonga were able to stand on their own. Skeptics, however, were saying that the situation is different because the Philippines is Lea’s home country. You are tasked with marketing Ms. Saigon. What exactly will you do to ensure an equally filled main theater of the Cultural Center of the Philippines during the time when the alternates take over the lead role?</a>

She doesn't have a hometown, and she won't ever have life-long friends. She has never been in one place The fist thing that strikes you about Katherine is her smile. It is by no means a perfect smile it isn't even close. It's how easily that smile comes that makes it so special. A glance from a nearby stranger will earn a broad smile. A smile will get a heartfelt grin, and agrin receives such laughing smiles that most people turn around after they've past and shake their heads with concem. This is a story about saying goodbye and then turning around and saying hello. It's about moving it's about change. It's about daily life in the Air Force. Each move means another house and different friends. Different rules and different cultures A simple smile helps Katherine through this change. Her joy is seeing others feel joy. Her happiness is helping others know happiness. She is dependent. Without others, her life would be hollow. Empty Who is Katherine Wamer?

She just can't say goodbye anymore. She doesn't want to go, but it is a warm, summer morning, but everyone inside the brick house is feeling cold. The children are aroused and teeth are brushed. Sleeping bags are rolled and stuffed in the car. Nothing remains except a few memories. Mom and Dad help the children into the car and get them buckled. They then climb into their own seats and say "Well adjust." But everyone's eyes are wet. "Why Alabama?" "What could be in Alabama? But there's no going back. The orders came. We move. Neighbors wave goodbye and friends turn away to hide their tears. Katherine presses her nose against the car window and watches the people slowly falling away behind.

                            4. Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</h2><br />

                            16. The “Miss Saigon” musical stage play premiered in 1991 with the highest advance ticket sales ever. By end 2000, over 70 million people from 10 countries have seen the show which earned some $1.3 billion. Miss Saigon then came to the Philippine on October 2000 for a 6-month run at the Cultural Center of the Philippines casting the original female lead actress, Ms. Lea Salonga playing the role of Kim (she won a Tony award for her performance as “Kim” in the original show in the United States). In the Philippine run, Lea Salonga was the main attraction. Those who have never seen the show and even those who watched the play abroad came to watch her. Lea Salonga performed to a full house until Christmas eve of 2000 when alternates Ces Campos (who also played Kim in other countries) and understudy Ima Castro took over the role of Kim.
Early on, it was acknowledged that the alternate of Lea Salonga are not well known and may have a tough time living up to the public’s expectations. Thus, ticket sales may suffer. In the past, shows abroad without Lea Salonga were able to stand on their own. Skeptics, however, were saying that the situation is different because the Philippines is Lea’s home country.
You are tasked with marketing Ms. Saigon. What exactly will you do to ensure an equally filled main theater of the Cultural Center of the Philippines during the time when the alternates take over the lead role?</h2><br />

Also, cats clean themselves while dogs need occasional baths. If you prefer a pet that requires more attention, you may be a dog person. Most dogs are very loyal and obedient.

Despite the important structural and cultural differences, both bacteria and viruses can cause disease in similar ways: they invade and multiply within the host by evading the immune system. Viruses are tinier than bacteria. All viruses have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. Also, unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack. A. Bubble MapB. Events ChainC.

They then climb into their own seats and say "Well adjust." But everyone's eyes are wet. "Why Alabama?" "What could be in Alabama? But there's no going back. The orders came. We move. Neighbors wave goodbye and friends turn away to hide their tears. Katherine presses her nose against the car window and watches the people slowly falling away behind.
