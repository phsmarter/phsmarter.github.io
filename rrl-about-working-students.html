                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Grade 11 ABM students face a variety of challenges and opportunities when pursuing higher education. One challenge is the lack of financial resources to pay for tuition, books, and other expenses associated with college or university. Many students may not have access to scholarships or grants that can help cover these costs. Additionally, some students may not have the necessary academic qualifications to gain admission into their desired institution. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there are also many opportunities available for grade 11 ABM students who wish to pursue higher education. For example, many universities offer special programs designed specifically for high school graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who demonstrate potential in their studies. These programs often provide financial assistance and mentorship support that can help make college more accessible and affordable for these students. Additionally, there are numerous online courses available that allow grade 11 ABM students to gain knowledge in a particular field without having to attend traditional classes on campus. </p><p></p><p>Overall, grade 11 ABM students should take advantage of all the resources available to them when considering higher education options so they can make an informed decision about their future path. With dedication and hard work, they can overcome any obstacles they may face along the way and achieve success in their educational pursuits!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest </p><br />

                            3. rrl about Reason that influence incoming senior high school student in choosing accountancy,business and management (ABM) strand</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM) strand is a popular choice among senior high school (SHS) students in the Philippines. Researchers have conducted studies to identify the reasons that influence incoming senior high school students in choosing this strand.</p><p></p><p>According to a study conducted by Garcia (2019), one of the primary reasons that influence incoming seniors high school students in choosing the ABM strand is the potential it holds for future job opportunities. The students recognize that the strand will provide a foundation for pursuing higher education in business management, accounting, finance, and entrepreneurship, among others. The students believe that graduating from the ABM strand will prepare them to become successful in the business sector.</p><p></p><p>Another reason identified in the study is the interest of incoming senior high school students in the subject. Students who have an inclination towards accountancy, business, and management are likely to choose the ABM strand. They believe that the ABM strand will help them develop their skills and achieve career aspirations.</p><p></p><p>In another study conducted by Gonzales (2018), peer influence was identified as a factor that affects the decisions of incoming senior high school students in choosing the ABM strand. The students tend to follow the recommendations of friends or family members who have had previous experiences in the ABM field.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, social media trends and advertisements also play a significant role in the decision-making process of incoming senior high school students. They are influenced by the images of successful businesses, job opportunities, and prestige that the ABM strand represents in the industry.</p><p></p><br />

                            6. The influence of mass media to moral development of grade 11 students RRL​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The influence of mass media on moral development has been a topic of much discussion and debate among researchers, educators, and parents. In recent years, concerns about the negative impact of media on the moral development of young people have grown. This literature review will examine relevant research on the influence of mass media on the moral development of grade 11 students.</p><p></p><p>According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, adolescents in the United States spend an average of over seven hours a day using media, including television, video games, music, and the internet. Given this high level of exposure, researchers have become increasingly interested in understanding the ways in which media influences the moral development of young people.</p><p></p><p>Studies have found that exposure to violent and sexually explicit media can have a negative impact on moral development. A study by Paik and Comstock (1994) found that exposure to violent media was associated with lower levels of empathy and higher levels of aggression in children. Similarly, research by Ward and Friedman (2006) found that exposure to sexual content in media was associated with earlier sexual behavior and less positive attitudes toward sexual relationships among adolescents.</p><p></p><p>However, not all media exposure has negative effects. Positive portrayals of pro-social behavior, such as helping others or standing up for what is right, can have a positive impact on moral development. A study by Johnson and colleagues (2002) found that exposure to media featuring positive role models was associated with higher levels of empathy and pro-social behavior among adolescents.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the content of media, the context in which it is consumed can also impact its influence on moral development. For example, research by Huesmann and Moise-Titus (1998) found that the impact of media violence on aggression was stronger when the violence was portrayed as justified or unpunished.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while the influence of mass media on the moral development of grade 11 students is complex and multifaceted, research suggests that exposure to violent and sexually explicit media can have a negative impact on moral development, while positive portrayals of pro-social behavior can have a positive impact. It is important for parents, educators, and media producers to be aware of these findings and to take steps to promote positive media content and responsible media use among young people.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As an artificial intelligence language model, I am not able to gather empirical data on the challenges encountered by adult students in senior high school at ACLC Manila. However, based on my general knowledge and understanding of the academic environment, some challenges that adult students may face in senior high school include:</p><p></p><p>1. Financial burden: Some adult students may have families or other responsibilities that require them to work while studying. This can make it difficult to manage finances and balance their time between work and studies.</p><p></p><p>2. Difference in learning styles: Adult students may have different learning styles compared to traditional high school students. They may prefer experiential or practical-based learning over theory-based lessons.</p><p></p><p>3. Time constraints: Adult students may have limited time to complete their coursework, attend regular classes, and participate in extracurricular activities due to other life responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>4. Social isolation: Adult students may find it challenging to connect with traditional high school students, as they may have different interests and experiences.</p><p></p><p>5. Lack of motivation: Adult students may struggle with motivation, as they return to school after a long break.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The impact of mass media on the moral development of grade 11 students can be significant. Mass media refers to any form of media that reaches a large audience, such as television, movies, music, social media, and video games. These forms of media can have both positive and negative effects on the moral development of students.</p><p></p><p>On the positive side, mass media can expose students to a wide range of ideas and perspectives that they might not encounter otherwise. This exposure can help broaden their understanding of different cultures, beliefs, and moral values. For example, watching a documentary on social justice issues can help students develop a sense of empathy and a desire to take action.</p><p></p><p>However, mass media can also have negative effects on moral development. For example, exposure to violence in movies and video games can desensitize students to violence and make them more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. Additionally, the glorification of certain behaviors, such as substance abuse or sexual promiscuity, can lead to moral confusion and misguided decision-making.</p><p></p><p>It's important for grade 11 students to be aware of the potential impact of mass media on their moral development and to be critical consumers of media. Teachers and parents can also play a role in helping students navigate these influences and encouraging them to seek out positive forms of media that align with their values.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>pa brainliest</p><p>thanks</p><br />

                        <p>Civic engagement is an essential component of democracy and has significant benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. However, many studies have shown that youth are less likely to be civically engaged than older adults. The following is a review of some of the literature on youth and civic engagement.</p><p></p><p>One study by Flanagan and Faison (2014) found that youth who participate in civic engagement activities, such as volunteering and community service, are more likely to have positive outcomes in areas such as academic achievement, psychological well-being, and future career success. Another study by Kahne and Sporte (2008) found that civic engagement can also lead to increased political knowledge and participation.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the potential benefits of civic engagement, many barriers prevent youth from participating in such activities. According to Youniss et al. (2002), these barriers include lack of access to resources and opportunities, negative attitudes toward politics and government, and lack of trust in institutions.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the role of technology and social media in youth civic engagement has become increasingly important in recent years. Several studies have shown that youth are using social media platforms to engage in political discussions, share information about social issues, and organize political protests (Bimber et al., 2012; Dahlgren, 2013).</p><p></p><p>Overall, the literature suggests that civic engagement is essential for youth development and has significant benefits for individuals and society as a whole. However, more research is needed to better understand the barriers that prevent youth from participating in civic engagement activities and to identify strategies for promoting youth civic engagement.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>About 14% of the global burden of disease has been attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders, mostly due to the chronically disabling nature of depression and other common mental disorders, alcohol-use and substance-use disorders, and psychoses. Such estimates have drawn attention to the importance of mental disorders for public health. However, because they stress the separate contributions of mental and physical disorders to disability and mortality, they might have entrenched the alienation of mental health from mainstream efforts to improve health and reduce poverty. The burden of mental disorders is likely to have been underestimated because of inadequate appreciation of the connectedness between mental illness and other health conditions. Because these interactions are protean, there can be no health without mental health. Mental disorders increase risk for communicable and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to unintentional and intentional injury. Conversely, many health conditions increase the risk for mental disorder, and comorbidity complicates help-seeking, diagnosis, and treatment, and influences prognosis. Health services are not provided equitably to people with mental disorders, and the quality of care for both mental and physical health conditions for these people could be improved. We need to develop and evaluate psychosocial interventions that can be integrated into management of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Health-care systems should be strengthened to improve delivery of mental health care, by focusing on existing programmes and activities, such as those which address the prevention and treatment of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria; gender-based violence; antenatal care; integrated management of childhood illnesses and child nutrition; and innovative management of chronic disease. An explicit mental health budget might need to be allocated for such activities. Mental health affects progress towards the achievement of several Millennium Development Goals, such as promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women, reduction of child mortality, improvement of maternal health, and reversal of the spread of HIV/AIDS. Mental health awareness needs to be integrated into all aspects of health and social policy, health-system planning, and delivery of primary and secondary general health care.What a theory of mental health should be.Christopher BoorseJournal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 1976Considers the ambiguity of the concept of mental health and suggests that the ambiguity is caused by the lack of an acceptable supertheory of psychiatry and the unwillingness of mental health theorists to take physiology as a paradigm. Granted the assumption of mental causation, an autonomous mental health theory can be generated by investigating the normal functional organization of the human mind and the degree of conformity of the individual to species design, ie, the inherited adaptive organization (the basic subject matter of biology). The current sources of mental health criteria (ie, affirmation of values, and abstraction from established diagnostic classes and social judgments of behavior) cannot generate an adequate theory because (a) the functional concept of health in physiological medicine has been insufficiently recognized,(b) contemporary biology has not recognized Darwin's interest in the adaptive functions of mental abilities, and (c) physical medicine began without reference to natural physiological functions. It is concluded that consideration of the requirements of normal developmental sequences would contribute significantly to a theory of mental health.(42 ref)(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The decision to choose a strand in Senior High School, such as Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM), is often influenced by several factors, which can be traced back to Junior High School. Generally speaking, students' experiences in their Junior High years can significantly impact their perspective in choosing a career pathway. Here are some of the reasons that influence students in selecting the ABM strand:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, students who demonstrate good performance in Mathematics, Economics, and Business-related subjects during Junior High are likely to choose the ABM strand. These subjects provide basic knowledge and skills needed in the strand, making it easy for them to excel in ABM's curriculum and help them prepare for their future business career.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, career awareness activities in Junior High play an essential role in decision-making for the ABM strand. Career talks, workshops, seminars, and counseling sessions provide opportunities for Junior High students to learn more about different careers and industries, including the ABM strand. Exposure to the business industry at this stage can help students solidify their interests in the industry and encourage them to pursue it later on.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, guidance and advice from parents, relatives, and friends who work in the business industry can influence students in choosing the ABM strand. Experience and knowledge from people who work in the industry provide a practical perspective on the profession's challenges and opportunities, which can help students make informed decisions.</p><p></p><p>Another factor that affects students' ABM strand decisions is the availability of learning materials and resources. Junior High institutions that offer comprehensive learning resources that cater to ABM-related subjects can positively impact students' interests in the strand. Accessible materials and a supportive learning environment can enhance students' learning experiences and help them develop their skills in the business industry.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, personal interest and passion are critical factors that influence students' ABM strand decisions. Junior High students who have a natural talent in managing finances or are into entrepreneurship are likely to choose the ABM strand. Such interests and passions can drive them to pursue careers in the business industry.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Junior High School experiences, such as performance in relevant subjects, career awareness activities, guidance, access to learning materials, and personal interest, play an essential role in influencing students' ABM strand decision. These factors can help students determine if the ABM strand is the right fit for their interests, skills, and career aspirations.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Several studies have suggested that there are several reasons that influence incoming junior high school students in choosing the Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM) strand. Below are some of the factors that may affect their decision:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1. Interest and Aptitude: A student's interest and aptitude may play a significant role in their decision to choose the ABM strand. Some students prefer working with numbers, enjoy problem-solving, or have an interest in entrepreneurial activities. They see the ABM strand as a means of exploring their interests and developing their skills to be successful in the business world.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Family Influence: Family background and values may also influence a student's decision to select the ABM strand. Parents who work in the corporate world or who own businesses may encourage their children to pursue a career in accounting, finance, or management. Family members may also provide guidance based on their experiences or the current job market.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Future Career Opportunities: Students may also consider future career opportunities when choosing the ABM strand. They recognize that the ABM strand provides a solid foundation for pursuing higher education in business management, accounting, finance, and entrepreneurship. This will prepare them for careers in industries such as banking, accounting, or investment.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4. Peer Influence: Peer pressure and social identity may also affect a student's decision to pursue the ABM strand. Friends, classmates, or seniors who do well in the ABM strand may inspire them to choose the same course. Additionally, they may be influenced by the perceived status associated with the ABM strand.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            30. As a student researcher, what are your thoughts about related literature? What are the major approaches in ordering or sequencing the topics and concepts you need to include in a RRL?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A review of related – and preferably recent – literature is meant to set your research in the context of what is currently known about the topic and to establish that what you have to offer is novel, something different from what has been already attempted. The review also reassures the referees that you are familiar with current developments in your field: if all of the papers that you cite in the review are, for example, at least 3–5 years old, the referees are bound to notice!</p><p></p><p>Coming to the second part of your query, a good review is not a chronological inventory. Do not simply list all the papers in the order in which they were published; a thematic organization is more effective. For example, in one paragraph, you may cite papers related to what is currently known about the topic; in another, you can mention papers that specifically relate to the method you have chosen. Another possibility is to group the papers by region: global studies forming one group, for example, and regional studies and national-level studies forming two more groups. Yet another possibility is by results: all the papers with similar results forming one group and those proposing a different hypothesis forming a different group, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Hope that helps. For more information on writing a review of related literature (RRL), you may refer to these previous queries by other researchers:</p><br />
