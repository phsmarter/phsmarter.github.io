Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                            6. What does respect have to do with you and with others?Find out more by reading the two excerpts. Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.
