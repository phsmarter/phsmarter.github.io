Tom and Bill were walking to school. They passed over a bridge, as they did every day. But on this day, the river was full, the water was clear and the sun was shining ina cloudless sky.
Tom said, "Let's go fishing!"
Bill wasn't sure. "We have a test today. Shouldn't we go to class?"
"Nonsense," said Tom. " You only lived once. A day like this won't come along again. "
Bill wasn't sure this was a good idea, but suddenly a fish jumped from the sparkling water. He decided Tom was right; they should definitely skip class on such a nice day.</a>

                                            Everywhere around us, there are millions of tiny living things callwd germs.They are so tiny that they can be seen only under the most powerful microscope.Some of these germs are no wider than twenty-five thousandths of an inch!         Louis Pasteur, the great French scientist, was the first to prove that germs exists. The germs in the air cam be counted. The number of germs around us, especially in crowded rooms, is tremwndous. Certain scientist counted 42,000 germs in approximately one cubic meter of air in a picture gallery when it was empty. But when the gallery was crowded with people, they found nearly 5,000,000 germs in the same place. In the open-air germs are less abundant. There are fewer germs in coumtry air than town air. We see at once how important it is, therefore, to live as much as possible in the open air, and for the rooms we live in to always be well ventilated by fresh air.According to the passage, where will you find more germs?A. In croweded spacesB. In the countryC. In hospitalsD. In the empty roomsEvidences:_______________________________________________________________​</a>

                            18. Everywhere around us, there are millions of tiny living things callwd germs.They are so tiny that they can be seen only under the most powerful microscope.Some of these germs are no wider than twenty-five thousandths of an inch!         Louis Pasteur, the great French scientist, was the first to prove that germs exists. The germs in the air cam be counted. The number of germs around us, especially in crowded rooms, is tremwndous. Certain scientist counted 42,000 germs in approximately one cubic meter of air in a picture gallery when it was empty. But when the gallery was crowded with people, they found nearly 5,000,000 germs in the same place. In the open-air germs are less abundant. There are fewer germs in coumtry air than town air. We see at once how important it is, therefore, to live as much as possible in the open air, and for the rooms we live in to always be well ventilated by fresh air.According to the passage, where will you find more germs?A. In croweded spacesB. In the countryC. In hospitalsD. In the empty roomsEvidences:_______________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
