                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Literature Review:</p><p></p><p>The impact of school funding on student achievement has been a topic of interest for many researchers and policymakers. Several studies have examined the relationship between school funding and student outcomes, including test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment.</p><p></p><p>A study conducted by Baker and Green (2018) found that increased school funding had a positive effect on student achievement, particularly for low-income students. The authors suggest that increased funding can lead to smaller class sizes, more experienced teachers, and better instructional materials, all of which can improve student outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Another study by Jackson and Bruegmann (2009) found that school funding had a significant impact on student achievement, but the effect varied depending on the source of funding. The authors found that funding from state sources had a greater impact on student outcomes than funding from local sources.</p><p></p><p>A study by Hoxby (2001) found that school funding had a minimal impact on student achievement, and that other factors such as teacher quality and curriculum were more important predictors of student outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>The quality of education that students receive is often determined by the resources available to schools. One of the most important resources is funding, which can be used to hire teachers, purchase instructional materials, and provide support services to students. The impact of school funding on student achievement has been a topic of debate among policymakers, educators, and researchers.</p><p></p><p>While some argue that increased funding can lead to better student outcomes, others question whether the relationship between funding and achievement is causal or simply correlative. This paper aims to explore the existing literature on the impact of school funding on student achievement and provide a comprehensive analysis of the findings. By examining the research in this area, we hope to shed light on the relationship between school funding and student outcomes and provide insights for policymakers and educators on how to improve student achievement through effective funding strategies.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A review of related – and preferably recent – literature is meant to set your research in the context of what is currently known about the topic and to establish that what you have to offer is novel, something different from what has been already attempted. The review also reassures the referees that you are familiar with current developments in your field: if all of the papers that you cite in the review are, for example, at least 3–5 years old, the referees are bound to notice!</p><p></p><p>Coming to the second part of your query, a good review is not a chronological inventory. Do not simply list all the papers in the order in which they were published; a thematic organization is more effective. For example, in one paragraph, you may cite papers related to what is currently known about the topic; in another, you can mention papers that specifically relate to the method you have chosen. Another possibility is to group the papers by region: global studies forming one group, for example, and regional studies and national-level studies forming two more groups. Yet another possibility is by results: all the papers with similar results forming one group and those proposing a different hypothesis forming a different group, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Hope that helps.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As an artificial intelligence language model, I am not able to gather empirical data on the challenges encountered by adult students in senior high school at ACLC Manila. However, based on my general knowledge and understanding of the academic environment, some challenges that adult students may face in senior high school include:</p><p></p><p>1. Financial burden: Some adult students may have families or other responsibilities that require them to work while studying. This can make it difficult to manage finances and balance their time between work and studies.</p><p></p><p>2. Difference in learning styles: Adult students may have different learning styles compared to traditional high school students. They may prefer experiential or practical-based learning over theory-based lessons.</p><p></p><p>3. Time constraints: Adult students may have limited time to complete their coursework, attend regular classes, and participate in extracurricular activities due to other life responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>4. Social isolation: Adult students may find it challenging to connect with traditional high school students, as they may have different interests and experiences.</p><p></p><p>5. Lack of motivation: Adult students may struggle with motivation, as they return to school after a long break. They may need additional support to stay motivated and engaged in their studies.</p><p></p><p>Addressing the challenges faced by adult students requires a supportive academic environment that caters to their unique needs, provides flexible learning opportunities, and encourages social interaction with other students.</p><br />

                            10. The influence of mass media to moral development of grade 11 students RRL​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The influence of mass media on moral development has been a topic of much discussion and debate among researchers, educators, and parents. In recent years, concerns about the negative impact of media on the moral development of young people have grown. This literature review will examine relevant research on the influence of mass media on the moral development of grade 11 students.</p><p></p><p>According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, adolescents in the United States spend an average of over seven hours a day using media, including television, video games, music, and the internet. Given this high level of exposure, researchers have become increasingly interested in understanding the ways in which media influences the moral development of young people.</p><p></p><p>Studies have found that exposure to violent and sexually explicit media can have a negative impact on moral development. A study by Paik and Comstock (1994) found that exposure to violent media was associated with lower levels of empathy and higher levels of aggression in children. Similarly, research by Ward and Friedman (2006) found that exposure to sexual content in media was associated with earlier sexual behavior and less positive attitudes toward sexual relationships among adolescents.</p><p></p><p>However, not all media exposure has negative effects. Positive portrayals of pro-social behavior, such as helping others or standing up for what is right, can have a positive impact on moral development. A study by Johnson and colleagues (2002) found that exposure to media featuring positive role models was associated with higher levels of empathy and pro-social behavior among adolescents.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the content of media, the context in which it is consumed can also impact its influence on moral development. For example, research by Huesmann and Moise-Titus (1998) found that the impact of media violence on aggression was stronger when the violence was portrayed as justified or unpunished.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while the influence of mass media on the moral development of grade 11 students is complex and multifaceted, research suggests that exposure to violent and sexually explicit media can have a negative impact on moral development, while positive portrayals of pro-social behavior can have a positive impact. It is important for parents, educators, and media producers to be aware of these findings and to take steps to promote positive media content and responsible media use among young people.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.CDC has been collaborating with global public health and industry partners to learn about Omicron, as we continue to monitor its course. We don’t yet know how easily it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, or how well available vaccines and medications work against it. More data are needed to know if Omicron infections, and especially reinfections and breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated, cause more severe illness or death than infection with other variants. Current vaccines are expected to protect against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths due to infection with the Omicron variant. However, breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated are likely to occur. With other variants, like Delta, vaccines have remained effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. The recent emergence of Omicron further emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters. Scientists are working to determine how well existing treatments for COVID-19 work. Based on the changed genetic make-up of Omicron, some treatments are likely to remain effective while others may be less effective. *</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sorry po 1 lang po alam ko</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The impact of mass media on the moral development of grade 11 students can be significant. Mass media refers to any form of media that reaches a large audience, such as television, movies, music, social media, and video games. These forms of media can have both positive and negative effects on the moral development of students.</p><p></p><p>On the positive side, mass media can expose students to a wide range of ideas and perspectives that they might not encounter otherwise. This exposure can help broaden their understanding of different cultures, beliefs, and moral values. For example, watching a documentary on social justice issues can help students develop a sense of empathy and a desire to take action.</p><p></p><p>However, mass media can also have negative effects on moral development. For example, exposure to violence in movies and video games can desensitize students to violence and make them more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. Additionally, the glorification of certain behaviors, such as substance abuse or sexual promiscuity, can lead to moral confusion and misguided decision-making.</p><p></p><p>It's important for grade 11 students to be aware of the potential impact of mass media on their moral development and to be critical consumers of media. Teachers and parents can also play a role in helping students navigate these influences and encouraging them to seek out positive forms of media that align with their values.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>pa brainliest</p><p>thanks</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here is a sample literature review on "The Learning Difficulties Encountered by G12 HUMSS Students in Learning Creative Writing":</p><p></p><p>Creative writing is an essential component of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) curriculum for Grade 12 students in the Philippines. However, many students encounter various difficulties in learning this skill, which may hinder their academic success and personal growth. This literature review aims to explore the existing research on the learning difficulties encountered by G12 HUMSS students in learning creative writing.</p><p></p><p>In a study conducted by Moraes and Pugliesi (2019), it was found that students often face challenges in generating ideas and organizing their thoughts into coherent written pieces. Similarly, Hidayatullah et al. (2020) noted that students struggle with grammatical and structural issues in their writing. Moreover, students may also find it challenging to apply the appropriate writing style for different contexts (Moraes &amp; Pugliesi, 2019).</p><p></p><p>In addition, the study conducted by Gupta (2017) revealed that students may encounter psychological barriers in their creative writing, such as lack of self-confidence, fear of criticism, and anxiety. These psychological factors may affect students' motivation to write, hinder their creativity, and lead to lower levels of engagement in the writing process.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, research by Langer and Applebee (2013) suggests that the teaching strategies employed by teachers can also impact students' learning of creative writing. Teachers who prioritize process-oriented instruction, such as brainstorming and revision, tend to have more successful outcomes in fostering students' writing abilities. On the other hand, teachers who focus solely on product-oriented instruction, such as assigning grades based on the final written product, may hinder students' creative expression and limit their writing potential.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the literature indicates that G12 HUMSS students face various difficulties in learning creative writing, including generating ideas, organizing their thoughts, applying appropriate writing styles, and overcoming psychological barriers. The study also suggests that teacher strategies play a crucial role in helping students overcome these challenges and develop their creative writing skills.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa Brainliest po if tama.</p><p>or follow for more.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM) strand is a popular choice among senior high school (SHS) students in the Philippines. Researchers have conducted studies to identify the reasons that influence incoming senior high school students in choosing this strand.</p><p></p><p>According to a study conducted by Garcia (2019), one of the primary reasons that influence incoming seniors high school students in choosing the ABM strand is the potential it holds for future job opportunities. The students recognize that the strand will provide a foundation for pursuing higher education in business management, accounting, finance, and entrepreneurship, among others. The students believe that graduating from the ABM strand will prepare them to become successful in the business sector.</p><p></p><p>Another reason identified in the study is the interest of incoming senior high school students in the subject. Students who have an inclination towards accountancy, business, and management are likely to choose the ABM strand. They believe that the ABM strand will help them develop their skills and achieve career aspirations.</p><p></p><p>In another study conducted by Gonzales (2018), peer influence was identified as a factor that affects the decisions of incoming senior high school students in choosing the ABM strand. The students tend to follow the recommendations of friends or family members who have had previous experiences in the ABM field.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, social media trends and advertisements also play a significant role in the decision-making process of incoming senior high school students. They are influenced by the images of successful businesses, job opportunities, and prestige that the ABM strand represents in the industry.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Grade 11 ABM students face a variety of challenges and opportunities when pursuing higher education. One challenge is the lack of financial resources to pay for tuition, books, and other expenses associated with college or university. Many students may not have access to scholarships or grants that can help cover these costs. Additionally, some students may not have the necessary academic qualifications to gain admission into their desired institution. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there are also many opportunities available for grade 11 ABM students who wish to pursue higher education. For example, many universities offer special programs designed specifically for high school graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who demonstrate potential in their studies. These programs often provide financial assistance and mentorship support that can help make college more accessible and affordable for these students. Additionally, there are numerous online courses available that allow grade 11 ABM students to gain knowledge in a particular field without having to attend traditional classes on campus. </p><p></p><p>Overall, grade 11 ABM students should take advantage of all the resources available to them when considering higher education options so they can make an informed decision about their future path. With dedication and hard work, they can overcome any obstacles they may face along the way and achieve success in their educational pursuits!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Peer pressure can affect any aspect of someone's life, including their education. People may be directly teased for being smart or earning good grades, leading to less effort or pride in their schoolwork; peer pressure in other areas may also spill over and influence educational performance. Peer pressure can cause students to do or say things they wouldn't normally do or say. It isn't always a bad thing: pressure from a student's peers to study harder or to stand up to bullying can have positive results. Peer Influence can be either positive or negative. If a student is influenced negatively by peer, it affects his or her academic performance. Nevertheless, stronger student do have an impact on their peers and actually help improve their overall academic performance.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>6 sentences</p><br />
