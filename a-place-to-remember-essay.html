"Do not answer this part" Here are the guidelines that you can use to improve the overall composition of our images. 1.Simplification. The easiest way to have a clear and strong composition is to keep things simple. Instead, oh having too much going on in the frame, keep the focus on a single subject 2.Rule of Thirds-this basic composition technique is based on the idea that placing your subject off-center yields a stronger, more natural-looking composition. Following this also serves as the perfect opportunity to shoot your subjects from different angle 3. Framing - it involves using or adding frame elements to emphasize and lead the viewer's eye towards your subject or to simply add interest to your image. 4) Leading Lines and Shapes - Road, bridges and even hallways are great for showing linear perspective. They have lines that become narrow standards the far end, potentially leading the eyes to where your main subjects may be. 5. Contrast - this can be used to make your subject stand out. It is simply surrounding the subject and fill the frame with lighter colors Remember: Photo essay is intended to tell a story or evoke emotion from the viewers through a series of photographs. They allow you to be more creative and fully explore an idea. Day in Life Photo Essay-one of the examples of photo essay. In this example, your narative focuses on specific subject for an entire day. A great way to understand what people get up to in their day-to-day is to follow them and photograph as you go.​</a>

I was in my grandma's house in a random afternoon where the electricity suddenly gone out. I did not know that things would turn out that way. Thank God it was still pretty light out, so I can endure being in the dark, or so I think.</p><p></p><p>Still, it was not a pleasant experience. There were only grandma and I in the house, and there weren't any candles or emergency lamp. I got bored quickly, and decided to lay on a sofa instead. The only source of light available was the ceiling, as it had a sort of see-through glass on it.</p><p></p><p>What made it even more unpleasant was that it had begun to rain all of a sudden. Desperately waiting for my parents to pick me up, I remember crying a little in front of my grandma. All the while enduring the dimming of the light as it turned to evening little by little. Still, looking back, I would love to experience it all over again.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about essay in this example of pandemic-themed essay: https://brainly.ph/question/2755653</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1 </strong></p><p></p><br />

"Do not answer this part" Here are the guidelines that you can use to improve the overall composition of our images. 1.Simplification. The easiest way to have a clear and strong composition is to keep things simple. Instead, oh having too much going on in the frame, keep the focus on a single subject 2.Rule of Thirds-this basic composition technique is based on the idea that placing your subject off-center yields a stronger, more natural-looking composition. Following this also serves as the perfect opportunity to shoot your subjects from different angle 3. Framing - it involves using or adding frame elements to emphasize and lead the viewer's eye towards your subject or to simply add interest to your image. 4) Leading Lines and Shapes - Road, bridges and even hallways are great for showing linear perspective. They have lines that become narrow standards the far end, potentially leading the eyes to where your main subjects may be. 5. Contrast - this can be used to make your subject stand out. It is simply surrounding the subject and fill the frame with lighter colors Remember: Photo essay is intended to tell a story or evoke emotion from the viewers through a series of photographs. They allow you to be more creative and fully explore an idea. Day in Life Photo Essay-one of the examples of photo essay. In this example, your narative focuses on specific subject for an entire day. A great way to understand what people get up to in their day-to-day is to follow them and photograph as you go.​</h2><br />
