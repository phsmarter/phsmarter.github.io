ABSTRACTThe study determines the frequency of performance activities employed by senior high mathematics teachers and its relationship to the attitude of the students towards the subject. It is a division-wide study which includes six hundred forty-four (644) grade 12 students of the three pioneering public senior high schools in Dumaguete City, as the respondents. Results showed that the respondents experienced performance activities in their Mathematics classes every class session (46.10%) followed by every other class session (37.54%) and then once a week (13.24%). It was revealed in the study that the respondents are very positive in learning Math when they can communicate with classmates and do performance activities. The respondents believed that Math concepts are important in everyday living. It was also found out that sex and age are not influencing factors in the students' attitude in Mathematics and the more frequent the teachers give performance and group activities, the more positive the attitude of the students become in learning Mathematics. Findings of the study were disseminated to encourage teachers to continuously provide hands-on and other performance tasks to develop positive attitude towards the subject. The present K to 12 grading system of the Department of Education which gives emphasis on performance tasks should be continuously utilized. Evaluation:​</a>

If in determining the attitude of students toward increases in tuition and other school fees, the respondents were grouped into 1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year and 4th year. _________3. If in environmental impact assessment of a proposed garbage dumping site, the opinions of individuals are not so relevant as the opinions of groups, e.g. a barangay or an organization. _________4. The names comprising the population of students in a school are numbered from 1 to n and a sample is drawn using random numbers taken from the calculators. _________5. Telephone surveys roadside sampling, selecting the nearest elements are examples. _________6. All employees of the company are listed in alphabetical order. From the first 10 numbers, you randomly select a starting point: number 6. From number 6 onwards, every 10th person on the list is selected (6, 16, 26, 36, and so on), and you end up with a sample of 100 people. _________7. The company has 800 female employees and 200 male employees. You want to ensure that the sample reflects the gender balance of the company, so you sort the population into two strata based on gender. Then you use random sampling on each group, selecting 80 women and 20 men, which gives you a representative sample of 100 people. _________8.An organization is looking to survey the performance of smartphones across Philippines. They divided the entire country’s population into cities and select further towns with the highest population and also filter those using mobile devices. _________9.

                                            There are few subjects that can stir up stronger emotions among doctors, scientists, researchers, policy makers, and the public than medical marijuana. Is it safe? Should it be legal? Decriminalized? Has its effectiveness been proven? What conditions is it useful for? Is it addictive? How do we keep it out of the hands of teenagers? Is it really the "wonder drug" that people claim it is? Is medical marijuana just a ploy to legalize marijuana in general? These are just a few of the excellent questions around this subject, questions that I am going to studiously avoid so we can focus on two specific areas: why do patients find it useful, and how can they discuss it with their doctor? Marijuana is currently legal, on the state level, in 29 states, and in Washington, DC. It is still illegal from the federal government’s perspective. The Obama administration did not make prosecuting medical marijuana even a minor priority. President Donald Trump promised not to interfere with people who use medical marijuana, though his administration is currently threatening to reverse this policy. About 85% of Americans support legalizing medical marijuana, and it is estimated that at least several million Americans currently use it. Marijuana without the high Least controversial is the extract from the hemp plant known as CBD (which stands for cannabidiol) because this component of marijuana has little, if any, intoxicating properties. Marijuana itself has more than 100 active components. THC (which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical that causes the "high" that goes along with marijuana consumption. CBD-dominant strains have little or no THC, so patients report very little if any alteration in consciousness. Patients do, however, report many benefits of CBD, from relieving insomnia, anxiety, spasticity, and pain to treating potentially life-threatening conditions such as epilepsy. One particular form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet syndrome is almost impossible to control but responds dramatically to a CBD-dominant strain of marijuana called Charlotte’s Web. The videos of this are dramatic. Uses of medical marijuana The most common use for medical marijuana in the United States is for pain control. While marijuana isn’t strong enough for severe pain (for example, post-surgical pain or a broken bone), it is quite effective for the chronic pain that plagues millions of Americans, especially as they age. Part of its allure is that it is clearly safer than opiates (it is impossible to overdose on and far less addictive) and it can take the place of NSAIDs such as Advil or Aleve, if people can’t take them due to problems with their kidneys or ulcers or GERD. In particular, marijuana appears to ease the pain of multiple sclerosis, and nerve pain in general. This is an area where few other options exist, and those that do, such as Neurontin, Lyrica, or opiates are highly sedating. Patients claim that marijuana allows them to resume their previous activities without feeling completely out of it and disengaged. Protect yourself from the damage of chronic inflammation.

Get simple tips to fight inflammation and stay healthy -- from Harvard Medical School experts. LEARN MORE View Protect yourself from the damage of chronic inflammation. Along these lines, marijuana is said to be a fantastic muscle relaxant, and people swear by its ability to lessen tremors in Parkinson’s disease. I have also heard of its use quite successfully for fibromyalgia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, and most other conditions where the final common pathway is chronic pain. Marijuana is also used to manage nausea and weight loss and can be used to treat glaucoma. A highly promising area of research is its use for PTSD in veterans who are returning from combat zones. Many veterans and their therapists report drastic improvement and clamor for more studies, and for a loosening of governmental restrictions on its study. Medical marijuana is also reported to help patients suffering from pain and wasting syndrome associated with HIV, as well as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease. This is not intended to be an inclusive list, but rather to give a brief survey of the types of conditions for which medical marijuana can provide relief. As with all remedies, claims of effectiveness should be critically evaluated and treated with caution.​pls: paki summary plszz</a>

Our neighbor is such a horrible person that one can deal with. 
He doesn’t care about his neighborhood because of his attitude.
As a matter of fact, everybody hates him because he talks arrogantly and doesn’t care whether he hurts the feelings of others or not. 
There was this one time when our old land lady went his house and asked him to minimize
the sound of his radio because most of her student boarders were studying.
Instead of responding to the request of the old lady, he humiliated her.

ABSTRACTThe study determines the frequency of performance activities employed by senior high mathematics teachers and its relationship to the attitude of the students towards the subject. It is a division-wide study which includes six hundred forty-four (644) grade 12 students of the three pioneering public senior high schools in Dumaguete City, as the respondents. Results showed that the respondents experienced performance activities in their Mathematics classes every class session (46.10%) followed by every other class session (37.54%) and then once a week (13.24%). It was revealed in the study that the respondents are very positive in learning Math when they can communicate with classmates and do performance activities. The respondents believed that Math concepts are important in everyday living. It was also found out that sex and age are not influencing factors in the students' attitude in Mathematics and the more frequent the teachers give performance and group activities, the more positive the attitude of the students become in learning Mathematics. Findings of the study were disseminated to encourage teachers to continuously provide hands-on and other performance tasks to develop positive attitude towards the subject. The present K to 12 grading system of the Department of Education which gives emphasis on performance tasks should be continuously utilized. Evaluation:​</h2><br />

                            23. There are few subjects that can stir up stronger emotions among doctors, scientists, researchers, policy makers, and the public than medical marijuana. Is it safe? Should it be legal? Decriminalized? Has its effectiveness been proven? What conditions is it useful for? Is it addictive? How do we keep it out of the hands of teenagers? Is it really the "wonder drug" that people claim it is? Is medical marijuana just a ploy to legalize marijuana in general? These are just a few of the excellent questions around this subject, questions that I am going to studiously avoid so we can focus on two specific areas: why do patients find it useful, and how can they discuss it with their doctor? Marijuana is currently legal, on the state level, in 29 states, and in Washington, DC. It is still illegal from the federal government’s perspective. The Obama administration did not make prosecuting medical marijuana even a minor priority. President Donald Trump promised not to interfere with people who use medical marijuana, though his administration is currently threatening to reverse this policy. About 85% of Americans support legalizing medical marijuana, and it is estimated that at least several million Americans currently use it. Marijuana without the high Least controversial is the extract from the hemp plant known as CBD (which stands for cannabidiol) because this component of marijuana has little, if any, intoxicating properties. Marijuana itself has more than 100 active components. THC (which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical that causes the "high" that goes along with marijuana consumption. CBD-dominant strains have little or no THC, so patients report very little if any alteration in consciousness. Patients do, however, report many benefits of CBD, from relieving insomnia, anxiety, spasticity, and pain to treating potentially life-threatening conditions such as epilepsy. One particular form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet syndrome is almost impossible to control but responds dramatically to a CBD-dominant strain of marijuana called Charlotte’s Web. The videos of this are dramatic. Uses of medical marijuana The most common use for medical marijuana in the United States is for pain control. While marijuana isn’t strong enough for severe pain (for example, post-surgical pain or a broken bone), it is quite effective for the chronic pain that plagues millions of Americans, especially as they age. Part of its allure is that it is clearly safer than opiates (it is impossible to overdose on and far less addictive) and it can take the place of NSAIDs such as Advil or Aleve, if people can’t take them due to problems with their kidneys or ulcers or GERD. In particular, marijuana appears to ease the pain of multiple sclerosis, and nerve pain in general. This is an area where few other options exist, and those that do, such as Neurontin, Lyrica, or opiates are highly sedating. Patients claim that marijuana allows them to resume their previous activities without feeling completely out of it and disengaged. Protect yourself from the damage of chronic inflammation.

Get simple tips to fight inflammation and stay healthy -- from Harvard Medical School experts. LEARN MORE View Protect yourself from the damage of chronic inflammation. Along these lines, marijuana is said to be a fantastic muscle relaxant, and people swear by its ability to lessen tremors in Parkinson’s disease. I have also heard of its use quite successfully for fibromyalgia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, and most other conditions where the final common pathway is chronic pain. Marijuana is also used to manage nausea and weight loss and can be used to treat glaucoma. A highly promising area of research is its use for PTSD in veterans who are returning from combat zones. Many veterans and their therapists report drastic improvement and clamor for more studies, and for a loosening of governmental restrictions on its study. Medical marijuana is also reported to help patients suffering from pain and wasting syndrome associated with HIV, as well as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease. This is not intended to be an inclusive list, but rather to give a brief survey of the types of conditions for which medical marijuana can provide relief. As with all remedies, claims of effectiveness should be critically evaluated and treated with caution.​pls: paki summary plszz</h2><br />
