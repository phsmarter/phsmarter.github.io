The Necklace by Guy de Maupassant (Summary) Mathilde Loisel is pretty and charming” but feels she has been born into a family of unfavorable economic status. She was married off to a lowly clerk in the Ministry of Education, who can afford to provide her only with a modest though not uncomfortable lifestyle Mathilde feets the burden of her poverty intensely. She regrets her lot in life and spends endless hours imagining a more extravagant existence. While her husband expresses his pleasure at the small, modest supper she has prepared for him, she dreams of an elaborate feast served on fancy china and eaten in the company of wealthy friends. She possesses no fancy jewels or clothing, yet these are the only things she lives for. Without them, she feels she is not desirable. She has one wealthy friend, Madame Forestier, but refuses to visit her because of the heartbreak it brings her. One night, her husband returns home proudly bearing an invitation to a formal party hosted by the Ministry of Education. He hopes that Mathilde will be thrilled with the chance to attend an event of this sort, but she is instantly angry and begins to cry. Through her tears, she tells him that she has nothing to wear and he ought to give the invitation to one of his friends whose wife can afford better clothing. Her husband is upset by her reaction and asks how much a suitable dress would cost. She thinks about it carefully and tells him that 400 francs would be enough. Her husband quietly balks at the sum but agrees that she may have the As the day of the party approaches, Mathilde starts to behave oddly. She confesses that the reason for her behavior is her lack of jewels. Monsieur Loisel suggests that she wear flowers, but she refuses. He implores her to visit Madame Forestier and borrow something from her. Madame Forestier agrees to lend Mathilde her jewels, and Mathilde selects a diamond necklace. She is overcome with gratitude at Madame Forestier's generosity At the party, Mathilde is the most beautiful woman in attendance, and everyone notices her. She is intoxicated by the attention and has an overwhelming sense of self-satisfaction. At 4 a.m., she finally looks for Monsieur Loisel, who has been dozing for hours in a deserted room. He cloaks her bare shoulders in a wrap and cautions her to wait inside, away from the cold night air, while he fetches a cab. But she is ashamed at the shabbiness of her wrap and follows Monsieur Loisel outside. They walk for a while before hailing a cab. When they finally return home, Mathilde is saddened that the night has ended. As she removes her wrap, she discovers that her necklace is no longer around her neck. In a panic, Monsieur Loisel goes outside and retraces their steps. Terrified, she sits and waits for him. He returns home much later in an even greater​</a>

                                            READ THE STORY FIRST TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
The Emperor’s Seed — A Story About Integrity
There was once an Emperor who had no children and needed to choose a successor.
Thousands of children from across the kingdom came to the palace and were surprised when the Emperor exclaimed that he was going to choose one of them. He gave them all a seed. They were to go home to their villages, plant the seed in a pot and tend it for a year. When they return in a year, the Emperor would judge their efforts and choose his successor.
There was a boy named Ling who received his seed and returned to his village.
His mother helped him to choose a pot and put some soil into it.
Ling watered his pot every day.
Once a week, the children of the village would get together to compare their plants. After a few weeks, there were signs of life in all but Ling’s pot.
The weeks passed and Ling continued to water his pot every day.
After a few months, the pots really came to life. Some had trees starting to grow, some had flowers and some had leafy shrubs. Poor old Ling still had nothing growing in his pot, leading the other children to make fun of him.
Ling continued to water his pot every day.
A year passed and it was time to return to the palace to show what had grown and decide on the new heir.
Ling was anxious as his pot still showed no signs of life. “What if they punish me? They won’t know that I’ve watered it every day, they’ll think that I’m lazy.”
His mother looked him in the eye and explained that whatever the consequences were, he had to return and show the Emperor his barren pot.
Ling and the other children entered the palace gates. By now, some of the plants were looking magnificent and the children were wondering which one the Emperor would choose.
Ling was embarrassed as other children looked at his lifeless pot and scoffed.
The Emperor came out and started to make his way through the crowd, looking at the many impressive trees, shrubs and flowers that were on display. The boys all puffed their chests out and tried to look as regal as possible, hoping that they would be chosen as the heir to the empire.
Then the Emperor came to Ling. He looked at the pot then he looked at Ling.
“What happened here?” He asked.
“I watered the pot every day, but nothing ever grew.” Ling muttered nervously.
Then he moved on.
After a few hours, the Emperor finally finished his assessment looking at wonderful grown plants.
He stood in front of the children and congratulated them on their efforts.
“Clearly, some of you desperately want to be Emperor and would do anything to make that happen, but there is one boy that I would like to point out as he has come to me with nothing. Ling, come here please.”
“Oh no,” thought Ling. He slowly sauntered to the front of the group, holding his barren pot.
The Emperor held up the pot for all to see and the other children laughed. Then the Emperor continued, “A year ago, I gave you all a seed. I told you to go away, plant the seed and return with your plant. The seeds that I gave you all were boiled until they were no longer viable and wouldn’t grow, but I see before me thousands of plants and only one barren pot. Integrity and courage are more important values for leadership than proud displays, so Ling here will be my heir.”

                                            os rage 2 Alunsina resented this reproach, and they quarreled all day. In his anger, Tungkung Langit drove his wife away. And with that, Alunsina suddenly disappeared, without a word or a trace to where she went. A few days passed, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely and longed for his wife. He realized that he should not have lost his temper. But it was too late, Ahunsina is gone. Their home which was once vibrant with Ahunsina's sweet voice, his home became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up, he would find himself alone. In the afternoon when he came home, he would feel loneliness creeping deep within him. sFor months Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation. Try as he did he could not find Alunsina. And so in his desperation, he decided to do something to forget his sorrow and win back his wife's favor. So he came down to earth and planted trees and flowers that she may notice it, but she still didn't come home. Then in desperation, he took his wife's jewels and scattered them in the sky. He hoped that when Alunsina should see them she might be induced to return home. 6Ahnsina's necklace became the stars, her comb the moon, and her crown the sun. But in spite of all his efforts, Alunsina did not return home. Until now, as the story goes, Tungkung Langit lives alone in his palace in the skies and sometimes, he would cry out for Alunsina and his tears would fall down upon the earth as rain and his loud voice, calling out for his wife, was believed to be the thunder during storms, begging for her to come back to their heavenly palace once more. 5.

 HOW THE WORLD WAS CREATED (PANAYAN )
One of the stories about the creation of the world, which the old folks of
Panay, especially those living near the mountain , do not tire relating, tell us that in
the beginning there was no heaven or earth--- only bottomless deep and a world of
mist. Everything was shapeless and formless—the earth, the sky, the sea, and the
air were almost all mixed up.
Then from the depth of this formless void, there appeared two gods, ---
Tungkung Langit and Alunsina . Just where the two deities came from it was not
known. However, it is related that Tungkung Langit fell in love with Alunsina and ,
after so many years of courtship, they got married and had their abode in the highest
realm of the eternal space where the water was constantly warm and the breeze was
forever cool. It was in this place where order and regularity first took place.
Tungkung Langit was an industrious, loving and kind god whose chief concern
was how to impose order over the whole confused set-up of things. He assumed
responsibility for the regular cosmic movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a
lazy, jealous , and selfish goddess whose only work was to sit by the window of their
Heavenly home , and amuse herself with her pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she
would go down from the house, sit down by a pool near their doorstep and comb her
long, jet – black hair all day long.
One day Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for
some time to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the
position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy on
Tungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it.
Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention
saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in
the world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a
quarrel between them followed.
Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In his rage, he divested his wife of powers
and drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.
Several days after Alunsina left, however, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely.
He realized what he had done. Somehow it was too late even to be sorry about the
whole matter. The whole place once vibrant of Alunsina’s sweet voice suddenly
became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up he would find himself
alone and in the afternoon when he came home, he would feel the same loneliness
creeping deep in his heart because there was no one to meet him at the doorstep or
soothe the aching muscles of his arm.
For months, Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation.He could not find
Alunsina, try hard as he would. And so, in his desperation, he decided to do
something in order to forget his sorrows. For months and months he thought. His
mind seemed pointless, his heart weary and sick. But he must have to do something
about his loneliness.
One day while he was sailing across the regions of the clouds, a thought
came to him. He would make a big basin of water below the sky so that he can see
the image of his wife, if she were just somewhere in the regions above. And lo! The
sea appeared. However, Alunsina was never seen.
After a long time, the somber sight of the lonely sea irritated Tungkung Langit.
So he came down to the Middleworld and created the land; them he planted this with
grasses, trees and flowers. He took his wife’s treasured jewels and scattered them in
the sky, hoping that when Alunsina would see them she might be induced to return
home , The goddess’ necklace became the stars, her comb the moon and her crown
the sun . However, despite all these Alunsina did not come back.
And up to this time, the folks in Panay say that Tungkung Langit is alone in his
palace in the skies. Sometimes, he would cry out of his pent – up emotions and his
tears will fall down upon the earth. The people say that the rain is Tungkung Langit’s
tears and that is why in some localities in the island of Panay, the first rain in May is
received with so much rejoicing and sacrifice. Incidentally, when it thunders hard, the
old folks also say that it is Tungkung Langit sobbing, calling for his beloved Alunsina
to come back - entreating her so hard that his voice thunders across the fields and
countryside.</a>

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

The Emperor’s Seed — A Story About Integrity
There was once an Emperor who had no children and needed to choose a successor.
Thousands of children from across the kingdom came to the palace and were surprised when the Emperor exclaimed that he was going to choose one of them. He gave them all a seed. They were to go home to their villages, plant the seed in a pot and tend it for a year. When they return in a year, the Emperor would judge their efforts and choose his successor.
There was a boy named Ling who received his seed and returned to his village.
His mother helped him to choose a pot and put some soil into it.
Ling watered his pot every day.
Once a week, the children of the village would get together to compare their plants. After a few weeks, there were signs of life in all but Ling’s pot.
The weeks passed and Ling continued to water his pot every day.
After a few months, the pots really came to life. Some had trees starting to grow, some had flowers and some had leafy shrubs. Poor old Ling still had nothing growing in his pot, leading the other children to make fun of him.
Ling continued to water his pot every day.
A year passed and it was time to return to the palace to show what had grown and decide on the new heir.
Ling was anxious as his pot still showed no signs of life. “What if they punish me? They won’t know that I’ve watered it every day, they’ll think that I’m lazy.”
His mother looked him in the eye and explained that whatever the consequences were, he had to return and show the Emperor his barren pot.
Ling and the other children entered the palace gates. By now, some of the plants were looking magnificent and the children were wondering which one the Emperor would choose.
Ling was embarrassed as other children looked at his lifeless pot and scoffed.
The Emperor came out and started to make his way through the crowd, looking at the many impressive trees, shrubs and flowers that were on display. The boys all puffed their chests out and tried to look as regal as possible, hoping that they would be chosen as the heir to the empire.
Then the Emperor came to Ling. He looked at the pot then he looked at Ling.
“What happened here?” He asked.
“I watered the pot every day, but nothing ever grew.” Ling muttered nervously.
Then he moved on.
After a few hours, the Emperor finally finished his assessment looking at wonderful grown plants.
He stood in front of the children and congratulated them on their efforts.
“Clearly, some of you desperately want to be Emperor and would do anything to make that happen, but there is one boy that I would like to point out as he has come to me with nothing. Ling, come here please.”
“Oh no,” thought Ling. He slowly sauntered to the front of the group, holding his barren pot.
The Emperor held up the pot for all to see and the other children laughed. Then the Emperor continued, “A year ago, I gave you all a seed. I told you to go away, plant the seed and return with your plant. The seeds that I gave you all were boiled until they were no longer viable and wouldn’t grow, but I see before me thousands of plants and only one barren pot. Integrity and courage are more important values for leadership than proud displays, so Ling here will be my heir.”

                            7. os rage 2 Alunsina resented this reproach, and they quarreled all day. In his anger, Tungkung Langit drove his wife away. And with that, Alunsina suddenly disappeared, without a word or a trace to where she went. A few days passed, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely and longed for his wife. He realized that he should not have lost his temper. But it was too late, Ahunsina is gone. Their home which was once vibrant with Ahunsina's sweet voice, his home became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up, he would find himself alone. In the afternoon when he came home, he would feel loneliness creeping deep within him. sFor months Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation. Try as he did he could not find Alunsina. And so in his desperation, he decided to do something to forget his sorrow and win back his wife's favor. So he came down to earth and planted trees and flowers that she may notice it, but she still didn't come home. Then in desperation, he took his wife's jewels and scattered them in the sky. He hoped that when Alunsina should see them she might be induced to return home. 6Ahnsina's necklace became the stars, her comb the moon, and her crown the sun. But in spite of all his efforts, Alunsina did not return home. Until now, as the story goes, Tungkung Langit lives alone in his palace in the skies and sometimes, he would cry out for Alunsina and his tears would fall down upon the earth as rain and his loud voice, calling out for his wife, was believed to be the thunder during storms, begging for her to come back to their heavenly palace once more. 5.

 HOW THE WORLD WAS CREATED (PANAYAN )
One of the stories about the creation of the world, which the old folks of
Panay, especially those living near the mountain , do not tire relating, tell us that in
the beginning there was no heaven or earth--- only bottomless deep and a world of
mist. Everything was shapeless and formless—the earth, the sky, the sea, and the
air were almost all mixed up.
Then from the depth of this formless void, there appeared two gods, ---
Tungkung Langit and Alunsina . Just where the two deities came from it was not
known. However, it is related that Tungkung Langit fell in love with Alunsina and ,
after so many years of courtship, they got married and had their abode in the highest
realm of the eternal space where the water was constantly warm and the breeze was
forever cool. It was in this place where order and regularity first took place.
Tungkung Langit was an industrious, loving and kind god whose chief concern
was how to impose order over the whole confused set-up of things. He assumed
responsibility for the regular cosmic movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a
lazy, jealous , and selfish goddess whose only work was to sit by the window of their
Heavenly home , and amuse herself with her pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she
would go down from the house, sit down by a pool near their doorstep and comb her
long, jet – black hair all day long.
One day Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for
some time to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the
position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy on
Tungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it.
Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention
saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in
the world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a
quarrel between them followed.
Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In his rage, he divested his wife of powers
and drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.
Several days after Alunsina left, however, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely.
He realized what he had done. Somehow it was too late even to be sorry about the
whole matter. The whole place once vibrant of Alunsina’s sweet voice suddenly
became cold and desolate. In the morning when he woke up he would find himself
alone and in the afternoon when he came home, he would feel the same loneliness
creeping deep in his heart because there was no one to meet him at the doorstep or
soothe the aching muscles of his arm.
For months, Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation.He could not find
Alunsina, try hard as he would. And so, in his desperation, he decided to do
something in order to forget his sorrows. For months and months he thought. His
mind seemed pointless, his heart weary and sick. But he must have to do something
about his loneliness.
One day while he was sailing across the regions of the clouds, a thought
came to him. He would make a big basin of water below the sky so that he can see
the image of his wife, if she were just somewhere in the regions above. And lo! The
sea appeared. However, Alunsina was never seen.
After a long time, the somber sight of the lonely sea irritated Tungkung Langit.
So he came down to the Middleworld and created the land; them he planted this with
grasses, trees and flowers. He took his wife’s treasured jewels and scattered them in
the sky, hoping that when Alunsina would see them she might be induced to return
home , The goddess’ necklace became the stars, her comb the moon and her crown
the sun . However, despite all these Alunsina did not come back.
And up to this time, the folks in Panay say that Tungkung Langit is alone in his
palace in the skies. Sometimes, he would cry out of his pent – up emotions and his
tears will fall down upon the earth. The people say that the rain is Tungkung Langit’s
tears and that is why in some localities in the island of Panay, the first rain in May is
received with so much rejoicing and sacrifice. Incidentally, when it thunders hard, the
old folks also say that it is Tungkung Langit sobbing, calling for his beloved Alunsina
to come back - entreating her so hard that his voice thunders across the fields and
countryside.</h2><br />

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.
