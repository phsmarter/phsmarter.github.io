                        <p>To validate.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>To validate and compare both sides of the reference. Comparing isn't a bar thing, it is just you identifying which side is good or bad.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We must analyze and see both sides of the story in order to understand each and any event clearly. Every mind works differently -- seeing the varying opinions of oppositions, men fighting for their own belief of "for the greater good", and more. Another thing is that people can hide or choose what they want the public to see when it comes to history, thus, even more supporting the idea that just scratching the surface of a story or issue is not enough. Any action that humans do stems from something, be the reason hidden, revealed, or even manipulated. Even in the present time, we must neither be quick nor rash in choosing sides or making decisions. Seeing a problem, movement, or change in society at a certain period of time in different perspectives is also crucial in understanding the causes and effects of those events not just on the environment, but also on individuals. </p><p></p><p>I'm sorry if I didn't cover three reasons or the thoughts were not organized, this was from the top of my head :) hope it helps!</p><p></p><br />

This is a combination problem because the order of the singers does not matter. The number of ways to choose two singers from 20 singers can be calculated using the combination formula:</p><p></p><p>nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!</p><p></p><p>where n is the total number of singers and r is the number of singers to be chosen.</p><p></p><p>In this case, n = 20 and r = 2. So, the number of ways to choose two singers from 20 singers is:</p><p></p><p>20C2 = 20! / (2! * (20-2)!) = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = <strong>190</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there are <strong>190</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ways</strong> to choose two singers from 20 singers.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hope it's help and click "brainliest" if you're satisfied with my answer! -Almedilla</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Characters : Cindy Green, Jim Green,Timothy Green, Joni Jerome, Evette Onat,Brenda Best,James Green, Sr. Uncle Bub</p><p>Setting:</p><p>Plot: Cindy and Jim Green are married and reside in Stanleyville, a town where the pencil and the Crudstaff family rule.Jim works as a foreman in Joseph Crudstaff's pencil factory, which is run by his ambitious son, Franklin Crudstaff.The factory is threatened by an unsustainable manufactured product, which could result in widespread layoffs or even the plant's closure.Cindy works as a tour guide at Bernice Crudstaff, Joseph's austere and humorless wife, who owns and curates the pencil museum.Cindy and Jim are keen to have children and believe they are now emotionally equipped to be the greatest parents they can be.Jim is resolved to not follow in the footsteps of his father, James Green, Sr., a bully who was never there for him. Cindy is resolved not to follow in the footsteps of her sister, Brenda Best, who is known for flaunting her parenting and her own children to the public.When Cindy and Jim hear that they are unable to have children biologically, they are devastated.They decide to host a memorial of sorts to commemorate the features of the biological offspring they will never have before moving on with their lives.Timothy, their ten-year-old "kid," enters their lives, and they shortly realize that he has physically sprouted from the memorial. Timothy possesses all of the attributes they listed, but they do not always present themselves in the way they expected.While Cindy and Jim just want Timothy to be a normal boy, they also want to keep him safe from prying eyes, especially as they try to conceal one apparent aspect of Timothy's personality from the public, an issue that can be concealed beneath clothing.Aside from the Crudstaffs, James, and Brenda, another person they want to protect Timothy from is one of his peers, Joni Jerome, with Cindy and Jim unaware of the cause for the two's tight friendship. Cindy and Jim have what could be the most important interview of their lives with Evette Onat and Doug Wert, to whom they tell the entire story of Timothy, including both the good and bad aspects of their parenting, in the hopes of conveying the underlying reason for Timothy's presence in their lives. </p><p>Conflict: Cindy and Jim Green try to bury their aspirations of having a child after receiving bad news from a fertility doctor by writing down all the wonderful qualities their child will possess and placing them in a box in the garden.They wake up in the middle of the night to find a youngster named Timothy standing in their kitchen, with leaves coming from his ankles, calling them mum and dad.Cindy and Jim are thrust into motherhood, and Timothy will teach them more than they could have dreamed about being parents and raising a child in the months ahead, regardless of how he enters their lives. </p><p>Theme: Peter Hedges' The Odd Life of Timothy Green is a fairy tale about parenting that stays kid-friendly while not completely glossing over the darker themes of its premise. It unsurprisingly concludes that anyone who truly wants a child should have one, but it also finds time along the way to warn future parents about how bad they might be at it.CJ Adams' wise-beyond-his-years performance as the title character is a forgiving stand-in for the family film's younger viewers, in sync with an overall upbeat tone that should do well at the box office.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
