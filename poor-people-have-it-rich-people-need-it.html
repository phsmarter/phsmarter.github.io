Whether you are rich, poor, man, woman, old, and young, we felt the impact especially to our basic needs. One of them is food. Some have money, but can't buy one due to lockdowns and exposure threat, worst is some don't even have the means to buy one. We all rely on our stocks and food packs that are kindly provided. The problem also is. though we want to plant for our food, land is insufficient, unhealthy, and we don't have the skill and knowledge in doing so.

Write your answer on the table below. 1. Arnel was walking to the canteen for his break. He was craving for something delicious. On his way, he saw all his classmates buying ham burger. The burger looks yummy. One of his classmates urged him to buy the same. He was thinking to buy the same just to join the group. While, he was in the line, he heard Ryan Bang over the radio saying, "Fudgee bar over sa sarap, ". So, he added fudgee bar to his checklist because he remembered he idolized Ryan. Arnel is next in line when he heard the guy beside him saymy, The ham burger is like ban burger. I didn't taste the ham. I regretted my choice." He ended replacing it with sandwich because it was featured on the school paper. The author mentioned it as the best sandwich2. During this global crisis, a lot of people specifically Filipinos are struggling to survive daily. The government is facing a tough battle but is very positive in helping the middle class, the poor and the poorest of the poor despite being insulted by the anti-government. The anti-government conducted numerous rallies to point that the administration is a failure in addressing the country's crisis. According to them, the government has no intention to help its people, instead, they keep pocketing funds, as they dubbed it as, "The most corrupt of all.” They are also trying to disqualify all the efforts of the government to help and protect its people by propagating misinformation, deceiving people through negative articles and news. For now, we are facing a problem that affects the whole world. We have to face this pandemic as one, as united people. Covid-19 chooses no one. The rich or poor, politicians, celebrities or the ordinary people. Therefore, we will be able to surpass this challenge if we will exert great effort of solidarity and not by dividing the people and the administration. In times like this we need to work as a team in order to heal as oneSelection #. Evaluative Words. Type of Bias and Propaganda 122. Bias by omission3. Transfer4. Testimonial5.

                                            How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</a>

Mallari Bayanihan is known as one of our traditions which portrays the values of unity, camaraderie, harmony, cooperation and teamwork in a community. In our modern times, this is still practiced. Tested by COVID-19, this Bayanihan serves as one of the solutions, when a member of a family can't go out because of restrictions, pasabuy (originally pasabay) made it possible of having your needs from the grocery store or market. Simply have the list of items and the amount it will require. That willingness to offer help within or outside the community proves how we value this tradition. It's notable to mention the kind of heroism and the helping ability of our frontliners: doctors, nurses, health workers, government officials, employees and the ordinary people. The conduct of relief operations coming from public and private sectors, rich or poor people also become visible. Prayer to our Almighty God also proves to be one of our major weapons to surpass fear and depression. Inculcated by our elders, Bayanihan is by heart still one of the traditions, an enduring value we, Filipinos do possess.. 7​</a>

During this global crisis, a lot of people specifically Filipinos are struggling to survive daily. The government is facing a tough battle but is very positive in helping the middle class, the poor and the poorest of the poor despite being insulted by the anti-government. The anti-government conducted numerous rallies to point that the administration is a failure in addressing the country's crisis. According to them, the government has no intention to help its people, instead, they keep pocketing funds, as they dubbed it as, "The most corrupt of all.” They are also trying to disqualify all the efforts of the government to help and protect its people by propagating misinformation, deceiving people through negative articles and news. For now, we are facing a problem that affects the whole world. We have to face this pandemic as one, as united people. Covid-19 chooses no one.

                            23. How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Okay I will revise your essay.</strong><p>Poverty is a complex societal issue that affects individuals, families, communities, and nations. It is defined as the inability to afford basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and education. However, poverty is much more than just a lack of money. It is hunger, sickness, unemployment, lack of access to education and healthcare, and living one day at a time. Therefore, poverty requires urgent attention from everyone, and it is not just the problem of the poor individual, but also the entire nation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, many people have the misconception that poverty is a choice made by the poor. They believe that poor people should just work harder to improve their lives. However, this is not always the case. In many situations, the poor lack access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities, which makes it difficult for them to escape poverty. It is not fair to judge people in poverty without understanding the structural and systemic issues that contribute to their plight.</p><p></p><p>To eradicate poverty, effective measures must be implemented by the government and society at large. These measures should focus on providing access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities to the poor. The eradication of poverty is essential for sustainable and inclusive growth for people, society, country, and the economy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a societal issue that requires the attention of everyone. It is not just the problem of the poor individual, but also the entire nation. To eradicate poverty, we must address the systemic issues that contribute to it and provide access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities for the poor. It is only by working together that we can create a world without poverty.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>Here are some tips on how to revise this essay on poverty:</strong><p></p>Check for clarity: Make sure your ideas are clear and easy to understand.

Mallari Bayanihan is known as one of our traditions which portrays the values of unity, camaraderie, harmony, cooperation and teamwork in a community. In our modern times, this is still practiced. Tested by COVID-19, this Bayanihan serves as one of the solutions, when a member of a family can't go out because of restrictions, pasabuy (originally pasabay) made it possible of having your needs from the grocery store or market. Simply have the list of items and the amount it will require. That willingness to offer help within or outside the community proves how we value this tradition. It's notable to mention the kind of heroism and the helping ability of our frontliners: doctors, nurses, health workers, government officials, employees and the ordinary people. The conduct of relief operations coming from public and private sectors, rich or poor people also become visible. Prayer to our Almighty God also proves to be one of our major weapons to surpass fear and depression. Inculcated by our elders, Bayanihan is by heart still one of the traditions, an enduring value we, Filipinos do possess.. 7​</h2><br />
