                                            Learning Task 4Adaptation and Evolution in Changing EnvironmentsLuis Miguel Rosalino, Luciano M. Verdade and Maria Carolina Lyra-Jorge  AbstractIn a planet in continuous change, where humans and their activities have enhanced this modification’s rate, wildlife had to develop mechanisms to cope with this change to avoid extinction. The challenges imposed by agricultural landscapes, often associated with production cycles and intensification, has led to the extinction of many populations or species unable to track resources or change their behavioral or biological processes to allow them to use the available resources. However, not always the story has negative outcome. In the present chapter, we present several examples of acclimation and adaption processes of species trying to survive in changing environment, which include morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations (i.e., with genetic implications) and behavioral acclimations. However, there is threshold of changes that a species may manage to overcome. This limit is species specific and directly related to the species natural history., plasticity and genetic structure and diversity.​</a>

Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

                            7. Learning Task 4Adaptation and Evolution in Changing EnvironmentsLuis Miguel Rosalino, Luciano M. Verdade and Maria Carolina Lyra-Jorge  AbstractIn a planet in continuous change, where humans and their activities have enhanced this modification’s rate, wildlife had to develop mechanisms to cope with this change to avoid extinction. The challenges imposed by agricultural landscapes, often associated with production cycles and intensification, has led to the extinction of many populations or species unable to track resources or change their behavioral or biological processes to allow them to use the available resources. However, not always the story has negative outcome. In the present chapter, we present several examples of acclimation and adaption processes of species trying to survive in changing environment, which include morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations (i.e., with genetic implications) and behavioral acclimations. However, there is threshold of changes that a species may manage to overcome. This limit is species specific and directly related to the species natural history., plasticity and genetic structure and diversity.​</h2><br />

-Refer to the given paragraph below, entitled “Picturing Don Quixote”: Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. What type of description is used in the paragraph? 
= Subjective description  
-The term that refers to the consequences or events caused by the climax. 
= Falling action 
-What type of figure of speech is used in the following sentence? The lady in the water screamed like a banshee 
= Simile  
-Read the following narrative essay: In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic.  THE writer presented what point of view? 
= First person  
-Read the following excerpt from the short story, Dead Stars by Paz Marquez Benitez:  Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid.  What narrative device was used in the paragraph? 
= Flashback  
-Read the following example of a definition paragraph:  The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein.   What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph? 
= Denotation  
-Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:  The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east at the Yellow Sea, travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain.  What type of description is used in the paragraph? 
= Objective description  
-Read the following example of a definition paragraph:  Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194).  What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph? 
= Extensive definition  
-Given the following sentence from the story, Dead Stars:  A round orange moon, "huge as a winnowing basket," rose lazily into a clear sky, whitening the iron roofs and dimming the lanterns at the windows.  What is the figure of speech used for the round orange moon? 
= Simile  
-The latin word from which the word "narration" comes 
= narrare</h2><br />
                        The subjective description is a kind of description that is based on the personal perspective or view, opinions and comments. Falling action is the part of a story where the consequences or changes of situation start to arise. Simile is the figurative speech that shows two things exactly the same. First person pertains to the main character of the story. This is commonly the first introduced character or subject from the story. Flashback is the process of reminiscing or looking back from the past. It is part of stories sometimes. Denotation means the literal and true meaning and definition of words. Objective description is fact-based writing or description. The word "Narration" was derived from the latin word, narrare. <br />

                            18. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />

It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />
