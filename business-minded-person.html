If so, can the municipal mayor validly use the exercise of Power of Taxation as a defense?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The determination of whether a business is a nuisance and whether it should be foreclosed is usually within the discretion of the local government unit, specifically the Municipal Mayor. The Municipal Mayor has the power to regulate and control the operation of businesses within its jurisdiction in order to promote the general welfare of its constituents.</p><p></p><p>In this case, if the operation of the KTV Bar is causing a nuisance to the community, the Municipal Mayor may order its foreclosure.

The Power of Taxation is a power of the government to impose taxes on individuals, properties, or businesses. It is not typically used as a defense against a foreclosure order.
