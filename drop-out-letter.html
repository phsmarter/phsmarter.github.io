Cut a small letter "e" from a newspaper paper. Using forceps of tweezers place it in the center of a glass slide in an upright position 2. Place one drop of water directly over the  specimen. Too much water over the specimen will cause the cover slip to float on top of the water, causing the specimen to float in and out of your field of view3. Place the cover slip at approximately 45 degree angle to the slide with one edge touching the water drop. Let go and allow the cover slip to fall onto the specimen. ​</a>

Cut a small letter "e" from a newspaper paper. Using forceps of tweezers place it in the center of a glass slide in an upright position 2. Place one drop of water directly over the  specimen. Too much water over the specimen will cause the cover slip to float on top of the water, causing the specimen to float in and out of your field of view3. Place the cover slip at approximately 45 degree angle to the slide with one edge touching the water drop. Let go and allow the cover slip to fall onto the specimen. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. If too much water is added, the cover slip will “float” creating a water layer that is too thick. If too little water is added, the specimen may be crushed or dry out too quickly.</p><p></p><p>2. Place a sample on the slide. Using a pipette, place a drop of water on the specimen. Then place on edge of the cover slip over the sample and carefully lower the cover slip into place using a toothpick or equivalent. This method will help prevent air bubbles from being trapped under the cover slip. </p><p></p><p>3.
