                                            GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.Question: 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer?3. which paragraph is the introduction?4. which part is the body of the essay?5. what does each paragraph contain? 6. which paragraph is the conclusion?7. which does the conclusion?​</a>

Captain America. Superman. Wonder Woman. These are famous superheroes that have kept their worlds safe, but they have also helped our world. The idea of superheroes has greatly benefited society by giving them creativity, confidence, and courage. Children usually dress up as superheroes during Halloween, or even on a regular basis. They do this not simply because they find their costumes, gadgets, and superpowers cool, but also because they look up to these superheroes as roles models. There must be something more than gadgets for these kids to admire superheroes and nor supervillains. The reason is because these superheroes are good. Not only do they fight the bad guys, but also they have the capability of bringing the best in us. This essay will discuss the history of superheroes, the difference between superheroes and other fictional characters, and how all these things have positively affected society (Suarez, 2012). ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________​</a>

                                            GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too. 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer 3. which paragraph is the introduction 4. which part is the body of the essay 5. what does each paragraph contain 6. which paragraph is the conclusion 7. which does the conclusion ​</a>

They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</a>

                            1. Three part essay about an invention that helped society in modern times</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Humans see problems and immediately start thinking of ways to fix them in the community, at work, at school, and at home by creating a new tool or technology. For example, microwaves were invented to heat food quickly, calendars were made to keep track of time, and computers were developed to process and store data. Many inventions have completely changed our lifestyles, like the invention of electricity. Other inventions merely make life more convenient, like dishwashers and lint rollers. Some of the most impactful inventions of the nineteenth century that changed the way we live were the telephone, the bicycle, and plastic.</p><p></p><p>       The telephone was an important invention because it enabled real-time communication with people in another location. Before the telephone, real-time communication was limited by location. People physically had to be in the same location in order to get an immediate answer to a question or quickly make plans with someone. Once the telephone was invented, that changed. This new possibility for real-time communication inspired other, more updated forms of communication that we use today. The telephone was an invention that influenced the way we communicate with people who are not physically with us by making real-time communication possible.</p><p></p><p>       Another very important invention from the nineteenth century was the bicycle because it was a unique form of transportation available to anyone. Like the telephone, the bicycle saved time. Before the bicycle was invented, people walked to many of the places they needed to travel to because it was inexpensive. However, it takes a long time to walk long distances. There were other, more expensive types of transportation like horses (or wagons that were pulled by horses) or the train. The bicycle was different from these forms of transportation because it was inexpensive and available to everyone. After the bicycle was invented, people began thinking about how to make the bicycle move without the rider providing the energy, and other forms of transportation were invented, like the motorcycle. Bicycles were one large influence on transportation.</p><p></p><p>       Finally, plastic was a revolutionary invention because it made certain products cheaper, but it also introduced a new attitude into society. Instead of selling something like soda in a glass bottle, many people started producing plastic bottles, which decreased the cost of many products. The low cost of many plastic products brought an interesting attitude with it; since it was so inexpensive, people began throwing them away instead of washing them. In recent years, many campaigns have been started to encourage people to reverse this new disposable attitude and recycle more. Plastic definitely changed the way many people live and the way many people think about living.</p><p></p><p>       It is obvious that these three nineteenth-century inventions dramatically changed the way people lived. Those changes were so profound that they have endured, and many of us could not imagine life without them. That's what many inventions simply seem to do: change the way people live. Hopefully these changes are for the better. Modern lifestyles will continue to change as new problems arise and people invent things to solve them. It is hard at times to think about life without these modern tools like microwaves and calendars. One thing is certain; we aren't done inventing things yet! There are still future problems to solve and innovations to create.</p><p></p>ExplanationI am not sure but hope it's help<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The author's reason for writing is to argue against the practice of grading students and to suggest that it is a flawed system that does not contribute to education.Phrases that prove this answer include "is it right to categorize students," "grading encourages learning and without it students would not study," "the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades," and "grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts."The introduction is not clearly marked, but the first paragraph can be considered the introduction as it introduces the topic of grading and its relationship to education.The body of the essay includes paragraphs 2-5, which provide arguments against the practice of grading students and the flaws of the grading system.Paragraph 1 introduces the topic, paragraph 2 argues that grading is based on fear and encourages cheating, paragraph 3 argues that grading focuses on memorization rather than true learning, paragraph 4 argues that grading creates inequalities and conflicts, and paragraph 5 suggests that the grading system cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul of the educational system.The conclusion is not clearly marked, but the last sentence of paragraph 5 can be considered the conclusion: "To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished."The conclusion summarizes the author's main arguments and suggests that education should not be based on conflict and competition. It also provides a clear thesis statement that grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Mark me Brainliest&lt;3<br />

Captain America. Superman. Wonder Woman. These are famous superheroes that have kept their worlds safe, but they have also helped our world. The idea of superheroes has greatly benefited society by giving them creativity, confidence, and courage. Children usually dress up as superheroes during Halloween, or even on a regular basis. They do this not simply because they find their costumes, gadgets, and superpowers cool, but also because they look up to these superheroes as roles models. There must be something more than gadgets for these kids to admire superheroes and nor supervillains. The reason is because these superheroes are good. Not only do they fight the bad guys, but also they have the capability of bringing the best in us. This essay will discuss the history of superheroes, the difference between superheroes and other fictional characters, and how all these things have positively affected society (Suarez, 2012). ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________​</h2><br />

Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Internet had been changed people's lives for years. It had improved our communicating and researching skills. In today's generation, internet is being our number one source of information. It brings facts which can help people understand things and go with the flow of society. Without the discoveries and explorations about internet, we couldn't have gone this far wherein most of us still relies on internet.</p><p></p><p>But internet doesn't full of positive comments and feedbacks. Deeper in that as we all can see, it has been the society's sick. Especially for teenagers, it has becoming their addiction as it covers a lot of platforms and online games. Many countries decided banning a certain platforms because of its toxicity and being a bad influence for the people living in there.</p><p></p><p>Together with it is the technology, most of the devices we're using includes the use of internet. Rich people use Internet-Of-Things (IoT) devices to do a specific task. Viewing CCTV while on the spot is an example of that.</p><p></p><p>However, not all things can just stay on bad things or on good things.  Particularly now that we have a pandemic, we must consider internet as our virtual teacher for helping us survive every single day. For schooling, it assists us to learn through online classes or short clips. There is many apps on the internet which can help us sustain proper education. Eventually, we all have to also be independent so we can cope in this period.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps po, goodluck!! i know it's been a very tough year for all of us but we can do this, i would like to say that please stand on our own and don't rely on this app, i'm helping my co students but that doesn't mean i tolerate this app as this minimizes the student's thinking ability^^</p><p></p><br />

                            18. Hi, please help me to paraphrase, edit and add more necessary words and sentences in this essay below. I will mark you the brainliest  if you help me thanks.The video tells us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they’re from, what they look and what their religion is. They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The video instructs us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they're from, how they appear, and what religion they follow. They also demonstrated how they are denied the opportunuty to receive a higher education. In our lives, education is the most essential thing a person that has in life. It is considered to be the key to life. It is disheartening to realize thst many people do not obtain the same education as others just because of their differences. We must extract the stereotypes and labels that was invented centuries ago. We are now living in a contemporary society, we must effect change and just live a tranquil life. As they put it, "we all share the same cosmos", so we must treat each of us equally and fairly. Equality should be spread around the world.</p><br />

                            19. Answer the following questions using own words "ESSAY"
1. What are the three views on human rights, what do you think is the most applicable in today's Philippine society?
2. In your own words, discuss how these views are observed in modern Philippine society.
A. Western views of human rights
B. Socialist view of human rights
C. Religious view of human rights</h2><br />
                        <p>1) Human rights are considered as the basic rights and freedoms that every person is entitled to, simply because they are human beings. These rights are considered inherent to human beings and are believed to be universal, inalienable, and indivisible. There are three main views on human rights: the Western view, the Socialist view, and the Religious view.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the most applicable view of human rights in today's Philippine society, it is difficult to determine a single view that is most applicable. Each view has its strengths and weaknesses and can be applied to different situations and issues. The most important thing is to recognize and promote the universality and indivisibility of all human rights, whether civil and political, economic, social, or cultural. It is also essential to respect and protect the rights of all individuals, especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized, regardless of their background, religion, or political beliefs. A comprehensive and balanced approach that recognizes the interdependence of all human rights is necessary to promote social justice and human dignity in Philippine society.</p><p></p><p>2) The Western view of human rights is based on the idea of individualism and liberalism, which emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and freedom from state interference. This view prioritizes civil and political rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, and the right to vote and participate in government. The Western view is typically associated with capitalist societies and is widely accepted in the Western world.</p><p></p><p>The Socialist view of human rights, on the other hand, is rooted in the principles of collectivism and socialism. It emphasizes the importance of economic, social, and cultural rights such as the right to work, education, healthcare, and a decent standard of living. The Socialist view also prioritizes collective rights and considers the state responsible for providing these rights to its citizens.</p><p></p><p>The Religious view of human rights is based on the idea that human beings are created by God and therefore have inherent dignity and worth. This view emphasizes the importance of moral and ethical values and promotes the protection of human life and dignity. The Religious view also considers the family and community as essential elements of society and prioritizes the rights of the vulnerable and marginalized.</p><p></p><p>In the Philippines, all three views of human rights have been observed in modern society. The Western view is evident in the country's Constitution, which guarantees civil and political rights to all citizens. The right to free speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to vote are all protected under the law. However, these rights are not always fully realized due to issues such as political repression, censorship, and violence against political activists and journalists.</p><p></p><p>The Socialist view is also observed in modern Philippine society, particularly in the government's efforts to promote social welfare programs and poverty reduction. The government provides subsidies for basic necessities, such as housing, healthcare, and education, and implements programs to address unemployment and poverty. However, the implementation of these programs has been criticized for being insufficient and ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the Religious view of human rights is widely embraced in Philippine society, where religion plays a significant role in people's lives. The Catholic Church, in particular, is influential in promoting moral and ethical values and advocating for the protection of human life and dignity. The Church is also active in providing humanitarian aid and social services to vulnerable and marginalized communities.</p><p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />
