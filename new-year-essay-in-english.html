                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

Along with "love," related English words like "libido" and "belief" also descend from lebuh. _____________________(Pahelp po)respeto nmn po.!​</a>

                                            Origins of the English Language 1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times. 2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the Saxons, into Great Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday). 3) Then we must comprehend or understand how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles and the Saxons and made them slaves. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is pork, but the animal itself is known as a pig. 4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced all the way back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”. 5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Every new year people make resolution to improve themselves in some way. For me, my New Year's resolutions are to study hard and give an undivided focus on learning. I have been a decent student, but this year I want to push myself to achieve even higher academic success.</p><p></p><p>          There are several reasons why I make studying hard as top priority for this year.  Firstly,  I want to set a good example for my younger sibling. As the oldest child in my family, I feel a sense of responsibility to lead by example and show them that hard work and determination can lead to success. Finally, I simply enjoy learning and want to do my best to absorb as much knowledge as I can.</p><p></p><p></p><p>           Another New Year's resolution that I have  is to focus more on learning. Though, we cannot separate learning more from getting higher marks, however, I would like to emphasize that I am doing this not to impress or make people like me more by getting outstanding grades.  I am doing this for myself. I want to learn more in such way I can improve myself by applying what I will be learning. So, I will have an undivided focus on my studies.</p><p></p><p>      Yes, it is common for New Year's resolution to be bonded with some planning and perseverance which others may find difficulty to keep up, but I believe it is possible to turn resolution into lasting changes as years go by. We just need  to celebrate small victories and stay motivated to continue working towards accomplishing the resolution.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>pa brainlest po!! <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A new year resolution is a promise that a person makes to themselves at the start of the new year to change or improve something in their life. It is a way for individuals to reflect on the past year and set goals for the upcoming one.</p><p></p><p>One of my personal resolutions for the new year is to improve my physical health. I plan to accomplish this by exercising regularly and eating a well-balanced diet. I also want to make sure I get enough sleep each night and reduce my stress levels. By making these changes, I hope to feel better, have more energy and improve my overall well-being.</p><p></p><p>Another resolution of mine is to focus on my mental health. I want to make sure that I take the time to practice self-care and to find ways to relax and de-stress. This might include things like meditating, reading, or spending time in nature. I also plan to make sure I stay connected with friends and family, and seek professional help if needed.</p><p></p><p>I also want to improve my professional skills. I plan to take some online courses or attend workshops to learn new skills that will help me advance in my career. I also want to be more focused and productive during my work hours.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, I want to travel more and experience new cultures. I want to visit new places and make memories that will last a lifetime. I plan to save money and set a budget for travel in the upcoming year.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, New Year's resolutions can be a powerful tool for personal growth and change. By setting clear, achievable goals and developing a plan to reach them, we can improve our lives and make this new year a successful one</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The beginning of a new year is often accompanied by a sense of renewal and a desire to make positive changes in our lives. This is reflected in the popular phrase "new year, new me," which suggests that we can use the start of a new year as an opportunity to reinvent ourselves and make the changes we want to see in our lives.</p><p></p><p>But what does it really mean to be a "new me?" For some, it may involve setting and working towards new goals, such as getting in shape, improving relationships, or advancing in their careers. Others may see it as a chance to try new things, break bad habits, or make a fresh start in some other way.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what being a "new me" means to each individual, the idea of starting the year off with a clean slate can be a powerful motivator. It gives us the opportunity to reflect on the past and make a conscious decision to do things differently moving forward.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the process of becoming a "new me" is not always easy. It requires effort, dedication, and commitment to see through the changes we want to make. But if we approach it with a positive attitude and a willingness to put in the work, we can make real progress towards becoming the best versions of ourselves.</p><p></p><p>So as the new year begins, let us embrace the opportunity to be a "new me" and make the positive changes we want to see in our lives. Whether it's setting new goals, trying new things, or breaking old habits, let us embrace the opportunity to grow and improve in the coming year.</p><br />

Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1.

                            7. Origins of the English Language 1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times. 2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the Saxons, into Great Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday). 3) Then we must comprehend or understand how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles and the Saxons and made them slaves. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is pork, but the animal itself is known as a pig. 4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced all the way back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”. 5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

                        <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong></p><p>My New Year resolution is to be more mindful of my physical and mental health. I want to make sure I'm taking time for myself to recharge and stay healthy. I plan to do this by setting aside time each day to do something for myself, like taking a walk, reading a book, or meditating. Additionally, I want to make sure I'm getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals, and exercising regularly. I also want to stay mindful of my mental health and be aware of how I am feeling, and make sure I'm getting help if I need it.</p><p>I also want to challenge myself to try new things. I plan to explore new topics, books, activities, and whatever else I can find. This will help me stay engaged and keep my mind active. I also want to find ways to stay connected with friends and family, even if we can’t physically be together.</p><p>Finally, I want to strive to be more patient and understanding. I want to take the time to really listen to others and think about the perspectives of those around me. This year I hope to be more open to new ideas and be more accepting of different opinions.</p><p>Overall, my goal this year is to focus on my physical and mental health and wellbeing, while also challenging myself to try new things and be more understanding. With these goals in mind, I'm confident 2023 will be a great year!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Ano ang New Year resolution ko? Well, hindi ko gusto ang mga New Year resolution dahil malakas akong naniniwala sa paggawa ng maliliit at maaabot na layunin bawat buwan na patuloy na bumubuo sa isa't isa. <p></p>PERO… ang bago kong layunin ay nag-time out sa bagong taon. Kaya matatawag natin itong resolusyon. Nakatuon ako sa PAGGAWA NG KULANG. Hindi gaanong tumatakbo, hindi gaanong abala, hindi gaanong kaguluhan! Ang layunin ko ay magpabagal sa proseso ng buhay, mamuhay nang maayos, at magpahinga. Sa aking opinyon, ito ay isang bagay na dapat magsimula sa karamihan upang makamit ang alinman sa kanilang mga layunin. Siguro hindi ito higit sa kung ano ang dapat nating gawin? Ngunit ano ang hindi natin dapat gawin? Iniangkop ng ating kultura ang pag-iisip na isang badge ng karangalan ang pagiging abala. <p></p>Iniisip na sila ay mahalaga at may higit na halaga kung sila ay abala. Paglalagay ng tagapuno sa kanilang mga araw at gabi na walang halaga sa kanilang buhay. Ano ang iyong mga sukatan ng tagumpay? Hindi kaya kung gaano ka malusog sa emosyonal o espirituwal? Hindi kaya kung para saan ang layunin ng Diyos na inilagay niya ako sa mundong ito? Kung iyon ang kaso, kailangan nating tumuon sa pag-aalaga sa ating sarili. Binibigyan natin ng araw ang ating sarili para magpahinga at maggasolina. Pagsasabi ng hindi sa iba at hindi pinupunan ang ating mga iskedyul ng mga bagay na dapat gawin. Ang pagiging sinadya sa ating oras at pag-atras mula sa mga kaganapan, gawain, at pakikipag-ugnayan sa lipunan. Ang pahinga ay kapaki-pakinabang sa ating sarili at sa mga tao sa ating paligid. Nasa atin ang ating mga limitasyon at maaari lamang pumunta sa malayo. At ang mga limitasyong iyon ay mukhang iba para sa bawat indibidwal na tao. Kaya wag mong ikumpara ang sarili mo sa kayang gawin ng iba. Kapag naabot natin ang mga limitasyong iyon, manhid tayo o magalit sa iba. Kaya magpahinga ka, hindi lang para sayo, kundi para din sa mga mahal mo.<br />
