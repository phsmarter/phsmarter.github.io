                                            Sex, Gender and Sexual Orientation In 2012 according to Filegon, the LGBTIQ acronym is used to refer to people who are from sexually or gender diverse communities and who may identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex or queer. However, there is a great deal of diversity within these communities and a wide range of "terms and language used to describe biological sex, gender, sexuality and sexual practice". In Western culture, people are generally expected to conform to gender roles that match their biological sex; however, many nonheterosexual, transgendered or queer people do not necessarily identify or fit within these narrow, socially defined parameters.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Transitional devices are like bridges between parts of your paper. They are cues that help the reader to interpret ideas a paper develops. Transitional devices are words or phrases that help carry a thought from one sentence to another, from one idea to another, or from one paragraph to another. And finally, transitional devices link sentences and paragraphs together smoothly so that there are no abrupt jumps or breaks between ideas.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several types of transitional devices, and each category leads readers to make certain connections or assumptions. Some lead readers forward and imply the building of an idea or thought, while others make readers compare ideas or draw conclusions from the preceding thoughts.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>paki brain list</p><br />
