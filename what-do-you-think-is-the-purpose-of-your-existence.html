Abstract​)ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PURPOSESWhat I know:1.B 4.A2.D 5.B3.C 6.AWhat’s New:obesity, poverty, climate change, drugs, bullyingWhat’s More:1.The issue is about how technology has changed people’s lives, behavior and moral outlook.The writer’s stand: He is not against technological developments in fact it improves man’s way of living, but he also reminds us that same technology will advance evil and harm.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras-
Outstanding Universal Value
The Rice Terraces of the Philippines Cordilleras are an outstanding
example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far
back as two milennia ago in the precolonial Philippines. They are found in the
remote areas of the Philippine Cordillera mountain range on the northern island
of Luzon, Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area.
The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces
located in four municipalities. They are all the products of Ifugao ethnic group.o
minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural
landscape of beauty beyond compare.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to
mankind. They were built 2,000 years ago and passed on through generations
and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by
modernization
Built on steeper lopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the
natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terrace have complex imigation
systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops.
The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole
community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of
biological resources which exist in the Ifugao Agri-ecosystem.
Questions:
1. What makes the Rice Terraces extraordinary?
2. Why do you think the Ifugao built the Rice Terraces?
3. How do the Rice Terraces reflect the culture of the liugao?
4. Why do you think the article is entitled "Outstanding Universal Value?"

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                            23. Instructions: Answer each item in 3-5 sentence paragraph.1. What do you think will happen in the world if communication doesn't exist? 2. Give at least five common non-verbal communication you do/use at home. Explain the meaning of each. 3. Before you start communicating with other people, what are the preparations you first need to do before sending your message based on Schreiner's communication process? 4. Which of the six considerations in ethical communication you think that you need to improve the most? Why? 5. As a student of purposive communication, how can you help in promoting peace and organization to your school/community?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. If communication doesn't exist, the world would be chaotic and disorganized. People won't be able to convey their thoughts, feelings, and ideas, which could lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and even wars. Without communication, it would be impossible to collaborate, cooperate, and achieve common goals. Society would not be able to function properly, and progress would be hindered.</p><p></p><p>2. Five common non-verbal communication at home are facial expressions, gestures, eye contact, posture, and tone of voice. Facial expressions convey emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise. Gestures like waving, pointing, or nodding can signify agreement, disagreement, or attention. Eye contact can indicate interest, trust, or respect. Posture can reveal confidence, insecurity, or fatigue. Tone of voice can reveal emotions or attitudes, such as sarcasm or sincerity.</p><p></p><p>3. Before sending your message, you need to prepare by analyzing your audience, choosing the appropriate channel, organizing your message, and adapting your style and tone. You need to consider who your audience is, their needs, interests, and expectations, and adjust your message accordingly. You also need to choose the right medium, such as email, phone, or face-to-face, depending on the context and purpose of your message. You need to organize your message by structuring it logically, using headings, bullet points, or visuals, and making it easy to read and understand. Finally, you need to adapt your style and tone to your audience, using appropriate language, avoiding jargon or slang, and being respectful and courteous.</p><p></p><p>4. Of the six considerations in ethical communication, I think I need to improve on being truthful and accurate. Sometimes, I tend to exaggerate or omit certain details to make my message more interesting or persuasive, which could be misleading or unethical. I need to be more aware of the facts and evidence to support my claims, and avoid making false or exaggerated statements. I also need to be more transparent and honest about my intentions and motives, and avoid using manipulative or deceptive tactics to influence others.</p><p></p><p>5. As a student of purposive communication, I can help promote peace and organization in my school/community by being an active listener, a critical thinker, and a responsible communicator. I can listen attentively to others' perspectives, empathize with their concerns, and seek common ground. I can also analyze complex issues, evaluate evidence, and present well-reasoned arguments. Finally, I can communicate respectfully, honestly, and constructively, avoiding personal attacks, stereotypes, or prejudices, and promoting mutual understanding and respect.</p><br />
