                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

deadly and the Farmer felt that he must die. As he drew his last breath , he said to those standing around: Learn from my

                                            Sample Critique Lee, published by Crime Factory Posted in Short Story Reviews, tagged Cameron Ashley, Crime Factory, Eric Beetner, fiction, Lee Marvin, publishing, reading, short story. The Dirty Dozen, writing on May 28, 2013. I recently finished a fiction anthology called, Lee. The book features seventeen short stories, all written by crime writers, and inspired by Lee Marvin- his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the first taking place In 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goffy, and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had published two of my short stories. I like what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else they've brought to the world.  &lt; I'm happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled the task of writing a Lee Marvin inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: JUST Swell," Cameron Ashley* *1967". The Gun Hunter. Eric Beetner. Beetner's novel The Devil doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three on my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June. I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with this writer, at least tangentially. Finishing Lee has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched the man Who shot Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I seen another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff. I took a step toward correcting this oversight last night by watching the Dirty Dozen- awesome! -CC Roy Jacob Posted by: Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46 pmyung picture po yung sasagotan thank you po ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Everyone who knows me calls me Jean. I grew up in a small town which has both mountains and sea. The town is just enough to support all of the residents' needs. I feel so lucky growing up in a place that has everything and I don't feel like going anywhere. It is the same way with all people I knew. When I was in High School, my mom got sick due to her progressive Parkinson's disorder. We had to leave the beach town and assimilate to the metro which I hated. I need to be reintroduced into a new circle of people. But we have to do this for our mother because there are no specialty doctors in our town. Due to looming hospital bills, we studied in a public school and it was scary because the students are rowdy unlike the private school we attended. I did not want to make friends with them. Day by day, we are running out of food. We had to buy our food everyday because weekly groceries are impossible. My older brother had to look for work to help us in the house. To make matters worst, we had to sell the little luxuries we have like our computers, tablets, and expensive stuffs. </p><p></p><p>To save money, I always skipped lunch. </p><p>One time, I was rushing to school that I forgot breakfast,  and so I did not eat breakfast and even skipped lunch. By 2 in the afternoon, mixed with hunger, difficulty of the math subject, and the heat, I almost fainted. My seatmate gave me water and was really concerned about me. She said that she can hear my stomach rumbling and asked me if I was hungry. Due to my pride, I said no. However, she went to her fried and asked for some extra food and lunch he did not consume during that lunch. </p><p>I ate it nonetheless. </p><p>The next day, I did not eat lunch again and so my seatmate and her friends game me one. I refused. </p><p>One time, I was really hungry and asked if I can have some food. I told them why I could not eat lunch. And so, everyday the whole class share a portion of their lunch and snacks for me. It really made me cry. It was like that until my mother got better when I am entering Senior High. Until now, I will never forget their kindness. I now appreciate that those who have less, give more. </p><p>All of us are still friends until college and help each  other with their woes. I am now studying Medicine to help people like my mom.</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19258525</p><br />

                            6. liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</h2><br />

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them.

                            21. Sample Critique Lee, published by Crime Factory Posted in Short Story Reviews, tagged Cameron Ashley, Crime Factory, Eric Beetner, fiction, Lee Marvin, publishing, reading, short story. The Dirty Dozen, writing on May 28, 2013. I recently finished a fiction anthology called, Lee. The book features seventeen short stories, all written by crime writers, and inspired by Lee Marvin- his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the first taking place In 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goffy, and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had published two of my short stories. I like what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else they've brought to the world.  &lt; I'm happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled the task of writing a Lee Marvin inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: JUST Swell," Cameron Ashley* *1967". The Gun Hunter. Eric Beetner. Beetner's novel The Devil doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three on my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June. I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with this writer, at least tangentially. Finishing Lee has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched the man Who shot Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I seen another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff. I took a step toward correcting this oversight last night by watching the Dirty Dozen- awesome! -CC Roy Jacob Posted by: Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46 pmyung picture po yung sasagotan thank you po ​</h2><br />
