Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

                                            'Ligtas na balik-paaralan': Groups, education stakeholders call for safe school reopening
Published September 7, 2021
by Gabriela Baron
Various groups and education stakeholders on Tuesday, Sept. 7, issued a five-point demand to the national government as another school year starts under the imposition of distance learning.
“The President has rejected at least three times the proposals to reopen schools in areas considered to be at low-risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, without providing a clear roadmap on how and when it plans to do so,” the groups said in a statement.
The groups hit Duterte’s failure to provide the requisites for the safe delivery of accessible quality of education amid the pandemic.
“Millions of youth and education workers will be again subjected to under-supported and onerous distance learning amidst the ranging pandemic and worsening economic crisis,” they added.
According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Philippines is one of the five countries in the world that have not started in-person classes since the pandemic began.
School closures have affected over 27 million students.
The Duterte administration is urged to roll out a clear plan for the immediate safe conduct of limited and voluntary in-classroom learning in low-risk areas; provide the needed teaching and learning resources for distance learning; ensure the provision of health protection and payment of just benefits to education workers; allocate higher budget to education in 2022; and implement genuine academic ease.
The groups also urged to ramp up the vaccination of teacher and education support personnel and grant P1,500 monthly Internet allowance to teachers and Internet subsidy to learners in need.
The unity statement is signed by the National Union of Students of the Philippines, NNARA-Youth, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Amihan, Gabriela-Marikina, Salinlahi, Kabataan, and Kabataan Partylist.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In recent years, schools have begun implementing policies that prohibit students from bringing cellphones to school. While these policies are intended to promote better focus and minimize distractions, the question remains: do they actually benefit students in the long run?</p><p></p><p>Proponents of the "no cellphone" policy argue that it promotes a distraction-free learning environment. With cellphones banned, students are less likely to be distracted by incoming messages or notifications, which allows them to focus more fully on their lessons. Additionally, without the temptation of texting or social media, students are more likely to engage with their peers in face-to-face conversations, promoting social interaction and improving interpersonal skills.</p><p></p><p>Opponents, on the other hand, argue that cellphones are an essential part of modern life, and banning them at school could limit students' access to important information and resources. For example, students may need to contact their parents in case of an emergency, or access online resources for research purposes. Additionally, some students use their cellphones as assistive technology, such as text-to-speech software, that helps them overcome learning challenges.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, banning cellphones can be seen as an infringement on students' personal freedoms. By taking away their cellphones, schools are essentially limiting students' ability to communicate and express themselves. This may lead to feelings of frustration and resentment among students, which could ultimately harm their overall learning experience.</p><p></p><p>Overall, whether or not cellphones should be allowed in schools is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both the benefits and drawbacks. While the goal of promoting a distraction-free learning environment is admirable, it is important to also consider the potential negative impacts that a cellphone ban could have on students' access to information and personal freedoms. Ultimately, each school should evaluate the situation and create policies that work best for their students and community.</p><p>The use of cellphones in schools has been a controversial issue for many years, with some educators and parents arguing that cellphones should not be allowed on school grounds. While there are certainly valid reasons to restrict cellphone use during school hours, a blanket ban on these devices is not the best solution.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary arguments against allowing cellphones in schools is that they can be a distraction. Students may be tempted to check social media or text friends during class, instead of focusing on the lesson at hand. However, this argument overlooks the fact that cellphones can also be incredibly useful tools for learning. Many students use their phones to take notes, access educational apps, or conduct research on the internet. By prohibiting the use of cellphones altogether, schools are denying students a valuable resource for their education.</p><p></p><p>Another argument against cellphones in schools is that they can be used to cheat. Some students may use their phones to access information during exams, for example. However, cheating is a problem that exists regardless of whether or not cellphones are allowed in schools. Teachers can take steps to prevent cheating, such as monitoring students during exams or using alternate assessment methods. Banning cellphones is not a solution to this problem.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, cellphones can be important safety tools. In the event of an emergency, a student may need to contact their parents or emergency services quickly. By prohibiting cellphones, schools are limiting students' ability to call for help if needed.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, a blanket ban on cellphones in schools is not the best approach. Instead, schools should implement policies that allow for responsible cellphone use. For example, students could be allowed to use their phones during designated times, such as lunch or recess, or in specific areas of the school. Teachers could also provide guidelines for appropriate cellphone use during class, such as turning phones off or setting them to silent mode. By allowing for responsible cellphone use, schools can harness the benefits of these devices while minimizing the potential drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while there are certainly valid reasons to restrict cellphone use in schools, a blanket ban is not the best solution. By implementing policies that allow for responsible cellphone use, schools can balance the benefits and drawbacks of approach and create a more effective learning environment for their students. This approach requires cooperation and communication between teachers, students, and parents to ensure that cellphones are being used appropriately and not causing unnecessary distractions. By providing clear guidelines and expectations for cellphone use, schools can help students understand when and how to use their devices to enhance their learning experience.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, schools can also play a role in teaching digital citizenship skills. Digital citizenship refers to the responsible and ethical use of technology, and it includes topics such as online safety, privacy, and respectful communication. By incorporating digital citizenship education into their curriculum, schools can help students understand the importance of responsible cellphone use and equip them with the necessary skills to navigate the digital world.</p><p></p><p>In summary, while the use of cellphones in schools has been a controversial issue, a blanket ban on these devices is not the best solution. Instead, schools should implement policies that allow for responsible cellphone use and provide guidance and education on digital citizenship. By doing so, schools can create a more effective and safe learning environment for their students while harnessing the benefits of technology.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>a</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Students should not be permitted to use smartphones in school.

Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

                            22. 'Ligtas na balik-paaralan': Groups, education stakeholders call for safe school reopening
Published September 7, 2021
by Gabriela Baron
Various groups and education stakeholders on Tuesday, Sept. 7, issued a five-point demand to the national government as another school year starts under the imposition of distance learning.
“The President has rejected at least three times the proposals to reopen schools in areas considered to be at low-risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, without providing a clear roadmap on how and when it plans to do so,” the groups said in a statement.
The groups hit Duterte’s failure to provide the requisites for the safe delivery of accessible quality of education amid the pandemic.
“Millions of youth and education workers will be again subjected to under-supported and onerous distance learning amidst the ranging pandemic and worsening economic crisis,” they added.
According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Philippines is one of the five countries in the world that have not started in-person classes since the pandemic began.
School closures have affected over 27 million students.
The Duterte administration is urged to roll out a clear plan for the immediate safe conduct of limited and voluntary in-classroom learning in low-risk areas; provide the needed teaching and learning resources for distance learning; ensure the provision of health protection and payment of just benefits to education workers; allocate higher budget to education in 2022; and implement genuine academic ease.
The groups also urged to ramp up the vaccination of teacher and education support personnel and grant P1,500 monthly Internet allowance to teachers and Internet subsidy to learners in need.
The unity statement is signed by the National Union of Students of the Philippines, NNARA-Youth, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Amihan, Gabriela-Marikina, Salinlahi, Kabataan, and Kabataan Partylist.
