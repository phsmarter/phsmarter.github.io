This was delivered for 30 seconds by Bryan Dyson, Coca-Cola’s Former CEO (one of the shortest speeches ever delivered in the world). This is a sample speech to actuate. Do the writing that follows. Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air. You name them - work, family, health, friends and spirit and you're keeping all of these in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls - family, health, friends and spirit - are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for it. Work efficiently during office hours and leave on time. Give the required time to your family, friends, and have proper rest. Value has a value only if its value is valued. If you were one of the listeners of this speech, what will you do? Make a narrative about it. Write your answer in a paragraph with 10-15 sentences. Please! Help me!​</a>

Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life?

                            1. sample speech about life</h2><br />
                        <p>Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, we have gathered today to speak about overcoming adversity and coping with the storms of life. This is very deep theme, and I am sure that anyone has many stories based on the challenges and their overcoming. But today we will concentrate on the issue of overcoming. In this light, it is important to emphasize the postulate that all challenges are timely, and they are not accidental. God tests us in such way. You cannot realize the real value of your life if you have not compared it to something. God sends us trials so that we could understand the deepness of His goodwill and love. No one is alone until he has his faith. The Bible has such words: “God withdrew from him, in order to test him, that He might know all that was in his heart” (Chronicles 32:31 NKJ). So, you see that even in His withdrawal, God is always with us. Sending us trials and challenges, He wants to demonstrate us the real power we have inside, the real power he gave us. Often we fail to use it properly, because we don’t know how strong we are. In order to help us see our values He assigned us to, He sends us trials. There is no sense in crying over the trouble – “the best way out is always through”, as Robert Frost claimed. So, you should not concentrate on your problems, but rather on the way how to solve them. Look forward, because life is beautiful, and God created it for us. “That which does not kill us makes us stronger” – these words of the famous philosopher demonstrate that we are the instruments in the hands of God. Remember, how many times you thought that this was the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Then you experience something even harder, and you understand that you became stronger. Now you can endure even more. This is the eternal process of human development. I have met a lot of people who overcame the storms of life with dignity and faith. they all admit, that these challenges made their lives brighter. They understood the real value of life – it is invaluable. And there is no sense in suffering – accept it and overcome. This is life. It does not consist of dreams and happy days, but of alternation of days and nights – both happy and miserable. Thus, another sense of adversity comes to the foreground – it makes us closer to our destiny. Japanese proverb says, “Fall seven times, stand up eight” – and this eighth may be lucky chance which will bring you to your happiness. May be not, but then you’ll have to believe, fight and stand up as much as it will be needed. Storms of life are transient, no matter how hard they are – some day you will definitely reach your desired peaceful shore.</p><p>Just listen to the words written in the Holy Bible: “Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been proved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him” (JAMES 1:12-13, 16-17 NKJ). Temptation to yield – overcome it! Temptation to blame God, fate and everybody around you in all your troubles – overcome it! All your life is the sequence of choices. When a person makes his choice in favor of faith – he wins! Overcoming adversities and demonstrating strong will and belief, a human will obtain the “crown” – for he has shown his love to God, by accepting all challenges as needed and coping with them with the name of God on the lips. And God loves us, helps us and support us, and this is the main truth a person should remember when fighting with difficulties in life. Don’t be alone in your struggle, accept it and entrust to your God. For, as He told, “…When you pass through the waters I will be with you; when you pass through rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze. For I Am the Lord…your Savior.” (Isaiah 43:2, NIV). All our mundane difficulties may seem crucial and catastrophic to us, but in fact they are only the episodes in the history of the humanity. Each life is saint and important in the eyes of God, so don’t thin your faith and sacrifice are inessential. They mean a lot, especially when they are heartfelt and sincere.</p><p>God bless you all!</p><br />

                            6. Read the speech and understand its meaning. This was delivered for 30 seconds by Bryan Dyson, Coca-Cola’s Former CEO (one of the shortest speeches ever delivered in the world). This is a sample speech to actuate. Do the writing that follows. Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air. You name them - work, family, health, friends and spirit and you're keeping all of these in the air. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls - family, health, friends and spirit - are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for it. Work efficiently during office hours and leave on time. Give the required time to your family, friends, and have proper rest. Value has a value only if its value is valued. If you were one of the listeners of this speech, what will you do? Make a narrative about it. Write your answer in a paragraph with 10-15 sentences. Please! Help me!​</h2><br />
                        <p>The moral theory known as “ the ethics of care” implies that there is moral significance in the fundamental elements of relationships and dependencies in human life. Normatively, care ethics seeks to maintain relationships by contextualizing and promoting the well-being of care-givers and care-receivers in a network of social relations. Most often defined as a practice or virtue rather than a theory as such, “care” involves maintaining the world of, and meeting the needs of, ourself and others. It builds on the motivation to care for those who are dependent and vulnerable, and it is inspired by both memories of being cared for and the idealizations of self. Following in the sentimentalist tradition of moral theory, care ethics affirms the importance of caring motivation, emotion and the body in moral deliberation, as well as reasoning from particulars. One of the original works of care ethics was Milton Mayeroff’s short book, On Caring, but the emergence of care ethics as a distinct moral theory is most often attributed to the works of psychologist Carol Gilligan and philosopher Nel Noddings in the mid-1980s. Both charged traditional moral approaches with male bias, and asserted the “voice of care” as a legitimate alternative to the “justice perspective” of liberal human rights theory. Annette Baier, Virginia Held, Eva Feder Kittay, Sara Ruddick, and Joan Tronto are some of the most influential among many subsequent contributors to care ethics.Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.
