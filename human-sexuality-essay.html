Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Human sexuality is a multifaceted topic.Discussions of sexuality can and should include information about anatomy, physiology, gender roles, sexual identity, love, interpersonal relationships, social/cultural factors as revealed in community standards and laws, and moral/spiritual/religious effects on sexuality.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>human sexuality is the way in which we experience and express ourselves as sexual beings (Rathus et al., 1993). There are many factors that help develop our sexuality, arguably one of the most important, is our actual gender.

Furthermore, sexuality is an integral part of our personalities whether we are aware of it or not.” Ludwin Molina. Here is my definition to me it is just the attraction to someone. The way you feel towards them mainly sexual feelings.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Every culture has a different belief or value when it comes to making sexual decisions. I would say it…show more content…</p><p>Like I said before the generations look at it very differently today’s generation is very much more accepting to it and older generations look down upon it they do not agree with it. I believe it just depends how you were raised and the times and places you have lived in.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>All people are made up of genetics from there parents. Wither a male or female each person is different not one can be the same. Gender roles have varied threw the generations. In the fifties women stayed home, cooked, cleaned and took care of the family while the men worked and brought food home for the family. Now the roles are very different. Men and Women are pretty equal, anything men do women have the same chance. Men also sometimes are the ones staying home taking care of the family. It is much more equal know. Relating to human sexuality it is much more accepted in the society it is not looked down upon to be affection.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Sexual arousal varies, it can be from all senses vision, smell, touch, taste, and hearing Vision because with human sexuality is when none sees some one and they are attracted to something goes off. This feeling comes upon them when they are around them see them or think of them. It is love/like or sexual attraction.</p><br />

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity​</strong></p><p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are two crucial aspects of a person's identity that have been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. While some argue that individuals should have the right to express themselves and love who they choose, others argue that certain sexual orientations and gender identities are unnatural or immoral. However, it is important to recognize that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, sexual orientation is a natural and normal part of human diversity. People can have different sexual orientations, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual. It is not a choice but rather an inherent characteristic of an individual's identity. People cannot control who they are attracted to, and it is not something that can be changed or "cured" through therapy or other methods. Therefore, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of sexual orientations.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, gender identity is also an inherent part of a person's identity. Gender identity refers to an individual's sense of their own gender, which can be male, female, or non-binary. Like sexual orientation, gender identity is not a choice but rather a part of who a person is. It is important to recognize and respect the gender identity of individuals, regardless of whether it aligns with their biological sex.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ often face discrimination and marginalization in society. This discrimination can manifest in many ways, including harassment, violence, and unequal treatment in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare. This discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, and can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>In addition to discrimination, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ also face legal barriers that limit their rights and freedoms. For example, in many countries, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and LGBTQ+ individuals are denied the right to adopt children or access fertility treatments. These legal barriers can further contribute to the marginalization and discrimination of LGBTQ+ individuals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected. Discrimination and marginalization of individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity are not only unfair but also harmful. It is important for society to recognize the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting world for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The concepts of human sexuality are learned. From our viewpoint, human sexuality involves at least three dimensions— biological, psychological, and sociocultural. Each dimension has many subdimensions.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>sexual behavior can best be understood in terms of developmental studies. Both nature and nurture are needed to explain the entire range of human sexual behavior, and sexual therapies also require attention to both of these elements. Sexual behavior begins before puberty, but the advent of puberty brings a greater interest in sex and greater range of sexual exploration than seen in childhood. Even though many people think that sex is simply ‘natural,’ and hence should be easy, many people have sexual problems. Fortunately, many of these can be overcome with accurate information about sex therapy</p><br />

                            25. THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF OPINION AND EXPRESSION 
Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regardless of 
sexual orientation or gender identity. This includes the expression of identity 
or personhood through speech, deportment, dress, bodily characteristics, choice 
of name, or any other means, as well as the freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, including with regard to human rights, 
sexual orientation and gender identity, through any medium and regardless of 
frontiers. 
EXPLAIN THE GIVEN PARAGRAPH AND EXPLAIN ITS IMPORTANCE. WIRTE AN ESSAY ABOUT IT. WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The preceding paragraph emphasizes the right to freedom of expression regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. It emphasizes that everyone has the right to express their identity or personhood in whatever way they see fit, whether through speech, dress, bodily characteristics, name choice, or other means. It also emphasizes the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of any kind, including those concerning human rights, sexual orientation, and gender identity, via any medium and without restriction.</p><p>This right is critical in ensuring that people have the freedom to express themselves without fear of repression or discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is significant because it ensures that individuals can freely express their ideas and opinions, challenge discrimination, and promote human rights. This right contributes to the growth of a diverse and inclusive society in which everyone's opinions and expressions are valued.</p><p>Freedom of expression is critical to the development of a democratic society. It enables people to express themselves, participate in public debate, and hold those in power accountable. The ability to freely express oneself contributes to the creation of an environment in which ideas can be shared and individuals can learn from one another. It also promotes social cohesion and mutual respect and understanding.</p><p>To summarize, the right to freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that must be protected and upheld. It is critical in combating discrimination and ensuring that individuals have the freedom to express their identity and personhood without fear of repression. The freedom to seek, receive, and disseminate information and ideas is also critical in constructing a diverse and inclusive society. As a result, it is critical to promote and protect this right in order to ensure that everyone's ideas and expressions are valued and respected.</p><p></p><br />

Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4. "Patchwork Girl" is a work of electronic literature by American Author, Shelley Jackson. I was written in Storyspace and published by Eastgate Systems in 1995, and tells the story through illustrations of parts of a female body that are stitched together through text and image.
