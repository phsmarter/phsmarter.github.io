That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                                            An Ideal Citizen 1. A citizen is a person who lives in a state and is governed by its laws in all matters. An ideal citizen is an asset to a nation. Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?

                            1. write a 5- paragraph essay about LOVE​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love is a universal human experience that has been explored through various mediums such as literature, art, music, and film. While love is often romanticized in popular culture, it is a complex emotion that can take on many forms and meanings. In this essay, I will explore the different dimensions of love and its impact on human relationships.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, love is often associated with romantic relationships between individuals. Romantic love is characterized by strong feelings of attachment, intimacy, and passion. It is the type of love that is typically portrayed in movies and romantic novels, and it is often seen as the ultimate goal in life. Romantic love can bring a sense of fulfillment and happiness, but it can also be accompanied by feelings of insecurity, jealousy, and heartbreak.</p><p></p><p>However, love is not limited to romantic relationships. Love can also be experienced through family bonds, friendships, and even a love for oneself. The love between family members is often unconditional and enduring, while friendships can provide a sense of companionship, trust, and support. Loving oneself is also crucial to one's mental and emotional well-being, as it promotes self-acceptance and self-care.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, love can have a significant impact on one's physical and mental health. Studies have shown that individuals in loving relationships experience lower levels of stress, improved immune function, and a longer lifespan. The positive effects of love on one's health extend beyond romantic relationships and can be observed in strong social connections, such as those formed through family and friendships.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, love is a multifaceted emotion that plays an integral role in human relationships and well-being. While romantic love is often romanticized in popular culture, it is essential to recognize the many forms of love that exist, including familial, platonic, and self-love. The positive impact of love on one's health and happiness cannot be overlooked, making it an essential aspect of human life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliests Naman kapalit Ng sagot haha salamat </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: Mother's Love</p><p></p><p>A mother's love is like no other. It is unconditional, selfless, and pure. From the moment a child is born, a mother's life revolves around ensuring the wellbeing of her child. A mother is the first person that a child sees and feels, and the bond they share is unbreakable. A mother's love is a beautiful thing, but it is also incredibly powerful. It has the ability to heal and soothe, to inspire great acts of bravery, and to bring immense joy and happiness. </p><p></p><p>A mother's love is evident in all the small things she does. It's seen in the way she cooks and packs lunches for her children or how she wakes up early in the morning to make sure they get to school on time. It's the way she tucks them into bed at night, telling them stories and singing lullabies. A mother's love is also found in the way she teaches her children valuable life lessons and offers guidance when they stray off the right path. </p><p></p><p>Although a mother's love is powerful, it's not always easy. It requires patience, sacrifice, and tough love at times. Mothers have to make difficult choices, and sometimes they have to be the bad guy to ensure their child's safety and success. But even in moments of discipline, a mother's love remains unwavering. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a mother's love is a force to be reckoned with. It is the purest form of love and has the power to shape a child's life. Whether it's providing comfort in times of sadness or celebrating their successes, a mother's love is always present. It's a gift that keeps on giving even as we grow older. So let us never take our Mother's love for granted and cherish it in our hearts forever.</p><br />

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>“Crush”</strong></p><p><strong>        I had my first crush when I was in high school. I was third year back then and my best friend April kept on taking me with her in the school pathway to wait for her crush to walk pass us. And when her crush comes, she would shriek and giggle as if she was kissed by her crush. I didn’t understand her excitement of seeing that boy until the unsuspected moment when I saw Stefan.</strong></p><p><strong>        Stefan is the campus crush in our small public school. I didn’t know that until the day I laid my eyes on him. As he walked in the pathway, I gazed upon the beauty of this handsome face. He walks like a runway model on a high fashion event. He’s a little bit taller than me and he has an ivory complexion. His face mimics the grace of that of an angel. His dark amber eyes were not big, not small or chinito, they were perfectly in the middle of those qualities. And his eye lashes were long and it totally complements the shape of his eyes. His nose is pointy and his lips were lusciously red.  And when he smiles, his white teeth brightens up my day like the glorious sun does to the buds of roses.</strong></p><p><strong>        The thing that caught me attracted to him was his eyes and his smile. I couldn’t describe how beautiful and extraordinary the feeling of him staring at me. It’s so magical that you were like caught in a loop were no one is around but the both of you. And when the enchanted moment of him smiling at you comes, it feels like the angels in heaven were singing and you were in your own paradise and nothing matters but that single moment where you look into each other’s eyes and it just makes you happy from the inside out.</strong></p><p><strong>        Stefan was a real gentleman. When my best friend was finally courted by her crush I found out that her crush and Stefan were cousins and at that moments, we were finally introduced to each other. It was raining that day and we were in the pathway. It felt like it was not raining at all, rather, snows are gently falling from the sky above us. When we were about to go home, he kindly asked me if he could walk with me. My heart pumped and I could not believe that he wants to walk me home. I could not catch my breath at that moment but I smoothly said yes. He hurriedly went to get his bag and borrowed an umbrella to I-don’t-know-who but he did it to prevent me from getting wet. While walking, I was looking at him and it was as if I was trapped in his beauty and suddenly, he grabbed my waist and drew me closer to him. I was so scared and I was trembling in excitement and at the same time confused about why he acted that way. For a moment, I thought that he was going to kiss me or something. But he brightly smiled at me and said,” you were about to step on a puddle of mud”. I blushed in shame because I was so distracted and I looked silly in front of him. When we arrived at the market were I’m supposed to take a ride back home, he voluntarily called a ride for me and I went home with the memory of his face looking and smiling at me.</strong></p><p><strong>        Eventually, he courted me and of course I gave him my sweetest yes. We were doing fine for the first few weeks but then, the end of the rainbow came and there was no pot of gold and unicorns but only fake coins and fake attitudes. He became so arrogant and prejudice. He talks about unfortunate people and laughs at their misfortune.   Slowly, I painfully fell from the paradise that I thought I had. The last straw of my patience broke when he demanded a kiss from me. I hesitated to give him that opportunity and I broke up with him. I realized that the most handsome face doesn’t always have the most handsome heart. But I thank him, for he has contributed to my maturity and my personality. It may not be in the most positive way but it surely ended well for me.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            10. An Ideal Citizen 1. A citizen is a person who lives in a state and is governed by its laws in all matters. An ideal citizen is an asset to a nation. Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?
