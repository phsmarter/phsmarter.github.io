                                            Don't raise your voice, improve your arguments. Read the argumentative essay and complete the argument chart.Topic:Claim:Arguments:a.b.C.d.Counterarguments:a100Note: An argument shows support for the author's claim (for example: reasons, evidence, data and statistics) while a counterargument explains the opposite point of view.   individualism is a fundamental part of a society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</a>

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        In a family, conflict is never absent. Parents yelling at each other while children crying, no idea of what's going on. In a family, conflict like financial crisis, unfaithfulness of a spouse, miscommunication, is always one of the reasons of family conflicts. Parents that have a big family to support their children and paid in minimum wages and have a lot of debt to pay is really devastating to imagine.   but for me, I think having conflict in a family is normal. There's no way that in a healthy and loving family, there's no conflict happening. It also gives a lesson to a family that has undergone such a situation. It makes their family more strongly to each other and it reminds the family to be open to each other. <br />

                        Family is an essential institution in society that plays a crucial role in shaping individual personalities and promoting social development. It is through the family that individuals learn values, beliefs, customs, and social norms, which are important for their personal growth and development. Besides, the family provides emotional and social support, which is essential in creating a conducive environment for personal growth and development. Therefore, it is vital to recognize the importance of the family as an institution that promotes social cohesion and individual growth.<br /><br />However, modern society has witnessed significant changes that have impacted the traditional family structure. The rise of single-parent families, same-sex marriages, and blended families has created new family structures that are different from the traditional nuclear family. While some people argue that these changes are detrimental to the family institution, others view them as positive developments that reflect the diversity and complexity of modern society. Regardless of the different perspectives, it is crucial to recognize that all families, regardless of their structure, have the potential to promote personal growth and social development.<br /><br />In conclusion, the family is a critical institution in society that plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' personalities and promoting social development. While changes in the family structure have impacted the traditional nuclear family, it is essential to recognize the value of all family structures in promoting personal growth and social cohesion. Therefore, policymakers and society should strive to create an environment that supports and fosters the well-being of all families, regardless of their structure, to ensure a healthy and vibrant society.<br />

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</h2><br />

                            5. argumentative essay about the balance between family support and letting the young adult try their own life​</h2><br />
                        In today's society, there is a constant debate about the balance between family support and letting young adults try their own life. On one hand, parents and guardians believe that it is their responsibility to provide support and guidance to their children as they navigate the complexities of adulthood. On the other hand, young adults argue that they need to be allowed to make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes in order to grow and develop as individuals. In this essay, I will argue that a balance between family support and individual autonomy is necessary for young adults to thrive.<br /><br />Firstly, it is important for parents and guardians to provide support and guidance to their children as they transition into adulthood. This support can come in various forms, such as emotional support, financial support, and career guidance. Parents and guardians have the life experience and knowledge to provide valuable advice and help their children navigate the challenges of adulthood. For example, parents can help their children with important decisions such as choosing a career path or managing finances.<br /><br />However, it is equally important for young adults to have the freedom to make their own decisions and take risks. This is necessary for personal growth and development. Young adults who are constantly sheltered and protected by their parents may struggle to develop independence and self-reliance. Furthermore, they may miss out on valuable life experiences that can help them develop important skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and self-reflection.<br /><br />Therefore, a balance between family support and individual autonomy is necessary for young adults to thrive. Parents and guardians should provide support and guidance, but also allow their children to take risks and make their own decisions. This can be achieved by setting clear boundaries and expectations, while also allowing young adults to learn from their mistakes and take responsibility for their actions.<br /><br />In conclusion, the balance between family support and individual autonomy is crucial for the development and success of young adults. Parents and guardians should provide support and guidance, while also allowing their children to make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes. This balance will help young adults develop important life skills and achieve personal growth, while also maintaining a strong connection with their family and support system.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Celestial bodies like asteroids and comets are “time capsules” that contain information about the history of our solar system, making them interesting targets of studies. The main difference between asteroid and comet is their composition. Asteroids and comets are debris left over from the formation of the moon and planets. Comets are located in the outermost regions of the solar system, while, asteroids are located in a belt between Jupiter and Mars. Occasionally, comets and asteroids change their orbital path due to gravitational disturbances, sometimes bringing them close to a planet. Craters on the moon and planets are evidence of the history of impacts with comets and asteroids.</p><p>Difference Between Asteroid And Comet</p><p>Comets are made of dust, ice, and rock materials, while asteroids are composed of rocky materials and metals. Both the celestial bodies were formed 4.6 billion years ago. Asteroids were formed much closer to the sun where it was impossible for the ice to remain solid. Comets were formed farther away from the sun where the ice remained solid. Comets that approach the Sun lose material with its every orbit around the sun as its ice melts and vaporizes to form the tail known as the coma.</p><p></p><p>Asteroid</p><p>Asteroid orbit the Sun and are small bodies on the solar system. They are made up of metals and rocks and also consist of organic compounds. They are similar to comets but don’t have a coma-like comet. Asteroids tend to have shorter and elliptical orbits. Astronomers have discovered millions of asteroids some that measure hundreds of kilometers across and some as small as dust particles.</p><p></p><p>Comet</p><p>Comets also orbit the Sun and are relatively small bodies of the solar system. When comets approach the sun, some part of their ice melts. When some parts of the ice melt, the other materials vaporize due to the heat of the sun. This results in a glowing halo that extends outwards as though sailing through space. The ice and compounds like ammonia and methane develop a fuzzy cloud-like shell known as the coma. This forms a notable difference between comets and asteroids.  </p><p></p><p>Difference Between Asteroid And Comet</p><p>Now that we have an idea of what asteroid and comets are let us write down the differences between them in a tabular column. The comparison between asteroid and comet in tabular form is given below.</p><p></p><p>Difference Between Asteroid and Comet</p><p>Asteroid	Comet</p><p>Asteroids have an elliptical orbit	Comets have an eccentric orbit.</p><p>It is made of metals and rocks	Made of rocks, hydrocarbons, and ice</p><p>Do not produce a coma or tail atmosphere	Thin, temporary atmospheric tail when close to the Sun.</p><p>The orbital period is 1 to 100 years	The orbital periods are 75 to more than 100,000 years.</p><p>1 to larger than 100 kilometers in size	1 to 10 kilometer in size (nucleus only)</p><p></p><p>Hope it's helps</p><p>Don't forget to Love Rate and make me Brainliest</p><p></p><br />

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Research can be defined as the systematic investigation and gathering of information or data on a specific topic or subject. It involves the exploration, analysis, and interpretation of various sources to gain knowledge and understanding about a particular subject.</p><p></p><p>2. To come up with research, you can gather information from various sources such as:</p><p></p><p>- Books and academic journals: These sources provide in-depth and reliable information on a wide range of topics. They often contain scholarly research and analysis conducted by experts in the field.</p><p></p><p>- Online databases and scholarly articles: Many reputable websites and online databases offer access to academic articles and research papers. These sources can provide valuable insights and up-to-date information on specific subjects.</p><p></p><p>- Government publications and reports: Government agencies often publish reports, statistics, and studies related to various topics. These documents can provide valuable data and information on local heritage, cultural significance, and historical background.</p><p></p><p>- Interviews and surveys: Conducting interviews or surveys with experts, community members, or family members can offer unique perspectives and personal insights into the local heritage being researched. These firsthand accounts can add depth and authenticity to the research.</p><p></p><p>- Social and print media: Social media platforms, news articles, and other media sources can provide information, opinions, and discussions related to the local heritage. They can help identify current issues, debates, and community perspectives on the topic.</p><p></p><p>When conducting research, it's important to critically evaluate the credibility and reliability of the sources.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a representative of the youth, I want to address an issue that may not be the most prominent in our society but affects many of us: mental health. Mental health is a subject that has been taboo for a long time, and many people still feel ashamed of talking about it or seeking help.</p><p></p><p>As a young person, I have witnessed how mental health problems have affected myself and my peers. The pressures of social media, academic success, and fitting in with our peers have led to feelings of anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts.</p><p></p><p>We need to address this issue, not only on a personal and family level, but also on a local and national level. We need to raise awareness of mental health and create a safe environment where people can talk about their struggles without fear of stigma or shame.</p><p></p><p>Our schools and communities can play an essential role in this process. We need to educate young people about mental health and the resources available to them. We need to provide access to mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, in schools and community centers.</p><p></p><p>Mental health should also be a priority in our government policies. We need to work towards creating a healthcare system that is more accessible, affordable, and provides quality mental health care for everyone.</p><p></p><p>No one should have to suffer in silence or feel ashamed of seeking help for their mental health problems. We need to work together to create a society that values and prioritizes mental health just as much as physical health.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, mental health is an urgent issue that needs more attention, awareness, and action. As a young person, I believe that we can make a difference by speaking out, supporting each other, and advocating for change. Let us break the stigma surrounding mental health and work towards a society that values and supports the mental well-being of all its members.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Power of Small Actions</p><p></p><p>As a representative of the youth today, I want to talk about the power of small actions. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the biggest issues in our world, but sometimes the biggest impact can come from the smallest actions.</p><p></p><p>For example, reducing our use of single-use plastics. It may seem like a small action, but by bringing a reusable water bottle or saying no to a plastic straw, we can collectively make a big impact on the environment. Or volunteering at a local charity or food bank. It may seem small, but it can make a world of difference to those in need and inspire others to do the same.</p><p></p><p>Small actions can also make a big difference in our personal lives. Taking a few minutes each day to practice gratitude or mindfulness can improve our mental health and well-being. Or making the effort to connect with a friend or family member, even if it's just a quick text or phone call, can strengthen relationships and make us feel more connected.</p><p></p><p>We don't need to wait for others to start making a change. We can be the change we want to see in the world, even if it's just in small ways. We can set an example for others and inspire them to join us. We can make a difference.</p><p></p><p>In a world where it's easy to feel powerless, let's remember the power of small actions. They may seem insignificant, but they can start a ripple effect that can change the world.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nowadays, it is clearly proven that vaccine really do help to lower the cases of Covid 19. So why wouldn't I get one for myself? It will not only help to lower the Covid-19 cases, it will also lower my risk of accumulating the said virus. Covid-19 vaccines are already given to 12-17 years old, meaning we can also get vaccinated. So why would we waste the chance to be vaccinated, when it can help us to lower the risk of accumulating the Covid 19? </p><p></p><p>For me, getting vaccinated is the key to solve this Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, we should also get vaccinated.</p><p></p><p>pa brainliest and pa follow!</p><p></p><br />

                            21. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

I agree with the reason that I believe, rather than cheat, students must learn how to balance their own time between studying and relaxing to be more productive, honest, and good students.

Hence, we must be very careful in believing and in accepting issues or principles in life. Now, suppose you are from a poor family and one day you happen to pass by a note saying, "If you were born poor, then you have no better future abead of you. You know you are poor. So does it mean you have no chance to have a bright future? The next question you asked yourself was, "Is this valid?" If so, "ls it a sound or a bad argument? Share your sentiments about this.

But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</h2><br />
