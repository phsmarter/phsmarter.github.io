How about you? Friend: Honestly, I am not good. I am feeling sad. You: Why? What happened?Friend: While I was on my way to school, I saw two different scenarios. First, I saw someone kicking a very thin and weak dog. I was so sad upon seeing that cruelty. Dogs are like humans too, they also have feelings and they also need food and shelter. Then, when I was at the bridge near the school, I saw a lady putting her cat inside a sack. I think the man and the lady deserve a punishment for their wrong doings. I am so disappointed because I am just a grade 8 student and I can't do something about it. You:Plssss po kailangan Kona ngayon​</a>

                        <p>We all make mistakes every day while performing our daily activities. However, there’s nothing wrong about making mistakes. As long as we learn from those errors, then it becomes less likely for us to repeat them again. So, what you should focus on improving yourself is not how often but instead, which areas you want to improve upon. When you determine this, you’ll know exactly where you should spend your efforts. <strong>A good way to improve myself</strong> would be by reading books related to leadership skills. <strong>By doing so</strong>, I will get inspired and motivated to continue working harder at becoming a better person.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>How the Most Effective Leaders Turn Weaknesses Into Strengths?</p><p></p><p> Just Recognize and accept your weaknesses, you can't turn a weakness into a strength if you're busy denying the weakness exists. So your first assignment is to recognize that you have weaknesses and determine what they are. And Get guidance from someone you trust. Look for ways to serve others with the same problem. Many successful launches come about because the founder needed that product or service him- or herself. So think about ways you can help both yourself and others compensate for your deficiency. Your weakness could wind up leading you to a successful new venture.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><strong>#Justmyresearch</strong><strong>#studyhard</strong><br />
