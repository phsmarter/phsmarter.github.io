                        <p>Okay let's take these questions in different parts.</p><p>First we need to instruct a classmate to find an object without giving any directional guide. </p><p>From here we can give them a guide without necessarily giving them "directional" guides by first telling them the objective of the exercise.</p><p>To answer the first question we must indicate if the item was found quickly. We can then assume that the person finding the item would have an easier time if the item is placed in an area that is familiar to them. In turn it would be harder for them to find it if they are not familiar with their surroundings.</p><p>Next we tackle the question if the instructions made it easier or difficult by giving the exact instructions given to the classmate to find the item.</p><p>For more information, visit these links:</p>https://brainly.ph/question/1948710https://brainly.ph/question/978126https://brainly.ph/question/231022<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong> Where you able to find an object? What were the object that obtain?</strong></p><p>Answer-It was difficult finding the object. We had to perform test, analysis, research, and experiment to have an assurance and to prove our hypothesis. We have to find not only one resource but more than. Numerous and reliable resources or reference help the study to answer the issue or hypothesis faster. It will end up with a conclusion where we put the proven facts and answers to the theory we have.</p><p><strong>Is the instruction clear and easy to follow? What made it so easy?</strong></p><p>​Answer-To make an instruction clear and easy to follow, start each step with an action verb. It takes a little practice to apply but it is effective and amazing to use. Use the command form. Make the first word by using a verb that captures the action. Example: Open the window.  </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: and  i hope this helps-</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            18. Activity 1. Where is it? Objective: You should be able to describe the position of an object within the house or in the backyard. Procedures: 1. Obtain from your parent/guardian the piece of an object like bottled glass/ball that describes where you will find the object. Q1. Were you able to find the object? Was it easy or difficult? Q2. Is the instruction clear and easy to follow? What made it so? 2. Put back the object to its place, if you found it. Otherwise, ask your parent/guardian first where it is located before you move on to the next step. 3. Revise the instruction to make it more helpful.

What other details or information included in your instruction that made it clearer and easier to follow? Q5. In your own words, what is a point of reference? How important it is?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This experiment is quite similar to the hide-and-seek game. The difference is that instead of people, you will going to find a missing object. </p><p>It's like, I hid an object, let's say, a ping-pong ball in a certain part of the house. Now, I instructed you to find it. To help you, I gave you a knife board.</p><p>Now, this comes the fun part. You have to guess where I put the ping-pong ball with the knife board as a hint. </p><p>An idea came to you. The KITCHEN! You went to the kitchen and tried to look for the mischievous ball. Then, you remembered that your mom usually uses the knife board near the kitchen sink. So, you proceed to look in there and surprisingly find the ping-pong ball in a small plastic basket together with the dishwashing paste and sponge!</p><p>After this little experiment, go back to your activity/homework and answer the questions. </p><p><strong>Q1. Were you able to find the object? Was it easy or difficult?</strong></p><p>The answer here may vary depending on your experience. You may answer this as <strong>"Yes, I was able to find it, and it's easy" </strong>or <strong>"Yes, I was able to find it but it was difficult" </strong>or <strong>"No, I could not find it at all. It was too difficult." </strong></p><p><strong>Q2. Is the instruction clear and easy to follow? What made it so?</strong></p><p>The answer here may vary. Just honestly tell your experience here. </p><p>In the next part... #3, you were asked to revise the instructions to find the object, the ping-pong ball in our example. You can make it more exciting by putting it in your backyard just behind those sweet-smelling pink flowers. Be creative in writing the instructions. If it were me, I will probably write "<strong>Location: Behind the pots of greens and flours</strong>". The "greens" here pertains to the leaves that are green in color and the "flours" is the homophone of flowers. </p><p>When you and your family members are done looking for the ball, you can proceed answering the other questions.</p><p><strong>Q3. Were they successful in finding the object? Was it easy for them or difficult?</strong></p><p>The answer may vary. Just write your experience.</p><p><strong>Q4. What other details or information was included in your instruction that made it clearer and easier to follow?</strong></p><p>The answer may vary depending on the information in the instruction you have given to your family member. Did you provide...</p>Codes?Cardinal directions? (e.g. north, east, south, west, etc.)Coordinates? (like a spy agent would give haha)Others<p><strong>Q5. In your own words, what is a point of reference? How important it is?​</strong></p><p>This is the conclusion of your game experiment. In the first part (#1 and #2), you used an object to locate the ping-pong ball. This was your reference point to find the missing ball. In #3, your reference point is the instruction you have given for your family member to locate the missing object. In my case, the example I had given, my reference point there is the pots of flowers. From that, we could say that <strong>a point of reference is a point (or something/object) we could use to compare with or describe the position of an object. </strong></p><p></p>Additional Info<p>This is an example of a reference point. </p><p>Suppose you are on the earth looking up to the sun while standing. You would say, "The sun is moving." You could say that because your reference point is the earth. But, if your reference point is the sun (it means it's like you are standing on it), you would be saying, "The earth is moving". (see attached pic)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Q1. If you give instructions to a blind-folded classmate to find an object without any directional guide, it would be very difficult for them to find the object. They might be able to locate the object if they randomly stumble upon it, but the chances of success are low.</p><p></p><p>Q2. The instruction given without directional guidance may not be clear and easy to follow as it lacks any guidance. The task can be challenging and confusing for the blind-folded classmate, making it difficult for them to find the object.</p><p></p><p>Q3. To make the task more successful, provide clear and precise directional guidance. For example, give instructions like, "Take five steps forward, turn left, take three steps forward, and the object should be on your right." This instruction is more helpful as it provides specific directions for the blind-folded classmate to follow.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
