And in working to make ends meet, their family members could not afford to supervise and provide supplementary guidance and lessons in remote learning setups," it noted The CHR called on DepEd and its development partners to strengthen their assistance and programs for low-income families and marginalized groups in order to prevent the widening of social inequalities. In doing so, the CHR said DepEd can focus next on long-term solutions to the impacts of climate change.

I honestly feel likeI'm not learning anything—just getting assignments back-to-back. The only thing I like about this is that I canbe home and I can choose when I want to do the work. I don't like the fact that I'm not learning anything-just watching YouTube videos and trying to figure out what I'm doing and if it's correct. In the future, I wouldnot choose to do online learning because I generally hate it and it's just adding more stress on me than !already have, plus if I have a question about something I have to wait for my teacher to respond. Andsometimes that response won't happen until the next day when I could have just finished the assignmentthe same day I was doing it. I also prefer to be in a physical classroom because I can also get help from mypeers if I need it and if it's online no one is really going to help me at all.1. What is the issue?2. What was the student experience on online learning?3. What was the only thing she liked on online learning?4. The student was against online learning because5. Why did the student in the article prefer to be in the physical classroom?6. If you were the student, which do you prefer online learning or face to face classes, why? Explainyour answer.​</a>

                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Wha Ecology Club Finds Gold in Garbage Good morning! This is the Great Discovery Integrated School News Center. For our news "Ecology Club Members Find Gold in Garbage" A group of students from the Ecology Club of Great Discovery Integrated School in Cavite ventured on a project to protect the environment through waste segregation. This was the result of their overnight stay at the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL) in Silang, Cavite. The Ecology Club members aimed to reduce the solid waste generated by students and maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school. Shane Frias, the club president said, "Through our club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation," she further explained. They began the project after talking to the students during the general assembly. The students were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. There were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, non-biodegradable, plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P 8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When asked about what they would do with their money, they said, “We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the Student Coordinating Organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speak, probably she would say, “Keep up the good work, kids." Here ends our news for today. This is Vincent, reporting from GDIS News Center. Good day and God bless!​</a>

Inyour notebook, copy the article below and underline the biased statements.andarK-Pop and Its Positive Influences on TeenagerseMest students assume that the music they like only influences their style. They wear clothes inspired by popular SouthKorean fashion. They get inspired for hair and makeup, too.Music relaxes people. One of the main benefits of listening to K-pop music while studying is that it acts as a stressreliever. K Pop music is often misunderstood as superficial. It's not. It's an emotional outlet, just like any other music that youwould recanmend to a student to listen. But when you get deeper into K-Pop music, you'll realize that it can be inspiring, too.Many tunes inspire students to work hard to achieve their dreams. Just take a look at the lyrics of 'Breakthrough' by Twice. Whena student struggles to write papers or study for the exams, that particular song can have an uplifting effect.KPop stars may be focused on their appearance. However, we cannot deny that they have to work hard to achieve thelifestyle that they lead. They practice for hours every day. They stay consistent with their healthy eating and exercise habits, andthey have great focus and determination,There are teens who become obsessed with K-Pop music. They imitate their favorite stars. They want to be thin and fit asthem. Such obsession can lead to eating disorders and depression. However, we can talk about the same extremes when wediscuss any other popular genre. When we take our attention away from the extremes, we'll realize that music, regardless of itsgenre, is beneficial for students. It helps them bond with their friends. It's a stress-relieving hobby, and students can benefit fromit.https://essentiallypop.com/epop/2020/03/impact-of-k-pop-music-on-academic-performance/​</a>

And in working to make ends meet, their family members could not afford to supervise and provide supplementary guidance and lessons in remote learning setups," it noted The CHR called on DepEd and its development partners to strengthen their assistance and programs for low-income families and marginalized groups in order to prevent the widening of social inequalities.

I honestly feel likeI'm not learning anything—just getting assignments back-to-back. The only thing I like about this is that I canbe home and I can choose when I want to do the work. I don't like the fact that I'm not learning anything-just watching YouTube videos and trying to figure out what I'm doing and if it's correct. In the future, I wouldnot choose to do online learning because I generally hate it and it's just adding more stress on me than !already have, plus if I have a question about something I have to wait for my teacher to respond. Andsometimes that response won't happen until the next day when I could have just finished the assignmentthe same day I was doing it. I also prefer to be in a physical classroom because I can also get help from mypeers if I need it and if it's online no one is really going to help me at all.1. What is the issue?2.

                            18. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Wha Ecology Club Finds Gold in Garbage Good morning! This is the Great Discovery Integrated School News Center. For our news "Ecology Club Members Find Gold in Garbage" A group of students from the Ecology Club of Great Discovery Integrated School in Cavite ventured on a project to protect the environment through waste segregation. This was the result of their overnight stay at the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL) in Silang, Cavite. The Ecology Club members aimed to reduce the solid waste generated by students and maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school. Shane Frias, the club president said, "Through our club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation," she further explained. They began the project after talking to the students during the general assembly. The students were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. There were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, non-biodegradable, plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P 8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When asked about what they would do with their money, they said, “We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the Student Coordinating Organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speak, probably she would say, “Keep up the good work, kids." Here ends our news for today. This is Vincent, reporting from GDIS News Center.

                            23. ofteof otLearning Task 4: Apply your knowledge on how to recognize when authors use assumptions or stereotypes in their writing. Inyour notebook, copy the article below and underline the biased statements.andarK-Pop and Its Positive Influences on TeenagerseMest students assume that the music they like only influences their style. They wear clothes inspired by popular SouthKorean fashion. They get inspired for hair and makeup, too.Music relaxes people. One of the main benefits of listening to K-pop music while studying is that it acts as a stressreliever. K Pop music is often misunderstood as superficial. It's not. It's an emotional outlet, just like any other music that youwould recanmend to a student to listen. But when you get deeper into K-Pop music, you'll realize that it can be inspiring, too.Many tunes inspire students to work hard to achieve their dreams. Just take a look at the lyrics of 'Breakthrough' by Twice. Whena student struggles to write papers or study for the exams, that particular song can have an uplifting effect.KPop stars may be focused on their appearance. However, we cannot deny that they have to work hard to achieve thelifestyle that they lead. They practice for hours every day. They stay consistent with their healthy eating and exercise habits, andthey have great focus and determination,There are teens who become obsessed with K-Pop music. They imitate their favorite stars. They want to be thin and fit asthem. Such obsession can lead to eating disorders and depression. However, we can talk about the same extremes when wediscuss any other popular genre. When we take our attention away from the extremes, we'll realize that music, regardless of itsgenre, is beneficial for students. It helps them bond with their friends. It's a stress-relieving hobby, and students can benefit fromit.https://essentiallypop.com/epop/2020/03/impact-of-k-pop-music-on-academic-performance/​</h2><br />
