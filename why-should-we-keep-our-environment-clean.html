In this selection will find out the problems met by the author in his desire to improve his community you you Activity 4: Identification Directions Read the selection carefully. Afterwards, identify the problems/issues met by the author in his desire to improve his community by listing down the issues in the table provided then put a label what issue is it Sanitary Reform and Famine Relief by: M.K. Gandhi It has always been possible for me to reconcile myself to any one member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been loathe to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal. I had been endeavoring to clear the community of a charge that had been leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth The charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put their house in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining the approval of the city fathers, who had desired our cooperation Our cooperation made work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships. For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking sanitary measures But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty, as I could in claiming for its rights At some places I met with insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean Toe expect them to find money for the work was out of the question. These experiences taught me better than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not the society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition, abhorrence and even moral persecution Why may not society regard as retrogression what the reformers holds dear as life itself? Nevertheless, the result of this agitation was that Indian community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping their house and environments clean I gained the esteem of the authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to ventilate grievances and press rights, I was no less keen and insistent upon self-purification There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done, namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the motherland India was poor the Indian settler went to South Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part off his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897 and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so in 1899 than 1897 We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of these families had been continued ever since, and we know that Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contribution to India in times of national calamity Thus, service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new implications of truth in every stage Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of truth, he richer the discovery of the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service.

                            14. gone several activities from the different parts of this module This time will be reading a selection entitled Sanitary Reform and Famine Relief". In this selection will find out the problems met by the author in his desire to improve his community you you Activity 4: Identification Directions Read the selection carefully. Afterwards, identify the problems/issues met by the author in his desire to improve his community by listing down the issues in the table provided then put a label what issue is it Sanitary Reform and Famine Relief by: M.K. Gandhi It has always been possible for me to reconcile myself to any one member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been loathe to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal. I had been endeavoring to clear the community of a charge that had been leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth The charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put their house in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining the approval of the city fathers, who had desired our cooperation Our cooperation made work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships. For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking sanitary measures But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty, as I could in claiming for its rights At some places I met with insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean Toe expect them to find money for the work was out of the question. These experiences taught me better than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not the society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition, abhorrence and even moral persecution Why may not society regard as retrogression what the reformers holds dear as life itself? Nevertheless, the result of this agitation was that Indian community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping their house and environments clean I gained the esteem of the authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to ventilate grievances and press rights, I was no less keen and insistent upon self-purification There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done, namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the motherland India was poor the Indian settler went to South Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part off his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897 and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so in 1899 than 1897 We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of these families had been continued ever since, and we know that Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contribution to India in times of national calamity Thus, service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new implications of truth in every stage Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of truth, he richer the discovery of the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service.
