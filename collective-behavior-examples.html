The culture of which we are a part impacts our identity and even our beliefs about the nature of life. The type of culture either Individualistic or Collective into which a person is born affects and influences what that person believes and how that person behaves. For example, someone growing up in a “tight” (Collective) culture, where rules are strongly enforced, does not support individualistic thought or behavior.​</a>

Use the template below as a guide. Bullying in Elementary Schools: Its Causes and Effects on Students By MS. Afroz Jan Abstract: Bullying is an everlasting problem in the lives of school kids. It is a problem that affects all students, the person who bully, those who are victims, and the persons who witnesses to interpersonal violence. Bullying may include verbal and physical assaults, threats, 'jokes' or language, mockery and criticizing, insulting behavior and facial expressions. These factors work individually, or collectively, to contribute to a child's likelihood of bullying. Bullying is difficult to eradicate in schools because it is so often effectively used by students. Teachers as professionals have to deal with the consequences of pupil-on-pupil bullying. The impact of prejudice-related bullying should not be underestimated. Bullying must be recognized, understood and taken seriously. The major objectives of this study were (i)To understand the nature of bullying (ii)To find out the causes of bullying (iii) To find out impact of pupil-on-pupil bullying on students 'learning. 10 teachers and 40 students were constituted as sample of the study. Simple random sampling technique was used to select respondents. Restricted response questionnaire was used as research tool for the collection of data about prejudice-based bullying in schools. Collected data were analyzed through SPSS by running frequencies, mean score, percentage and standard deviation. The findings of the study revealed that the most commonly mentioned cause of bullying behavior was power fullness (for example, I depend on myself rather than other) and physical (for example, hitting and punching) abuse. There is an urgent need to develop anti bullying policies in schools to identify and find ways of enabling pupils to seek out the help that they needed.

1. How did the school program prepare the students
for what they will do after they graduated from
high school?
2. What are the prepared programs of the school for
their students after they graduated from high
school?
3. How does restricting the use of mobile phones in
school affect the student's social interaction?
4. How do students define online learning
engagement?</h2><br />
                        <br />1. Offer a college preparatory curriculum and make sure that, by ninth grade, students understand academic requirements for college entry and success. Use assessment throughout high school to help students understand their relative readiness for college, and help them address any identified deficiencies.<br /><br />3. Although cell phones also have opened the door to be able to communicate in different ways, they also have less interactions because people are constantly on their phones or checking them which distracts them from the present moment.<br /><br />4. online learning is beneficial to the students, tutors and the institution offering these courses. I would therefore recommend that online learning be implemented on all learning institutions and research on how to improve this learning process should be carried out.<br /><br />hope it helps!<br />

Use the template below as a guide. Bullying in Elementary Schools: Its Causes and Effects on Students By MS. Afroz Jan Abstract: Bullying is an everlasting problem in the lives of school kids. It is a problem that affects all students, the person who bully, those who are victims, and the persons who witnesses to interpersonal violence. Bullying may include verbal and physical assaults, threats, 'jokes' or language, mockery and criticizing, insulting behavior and facial expressions. These factors work individually, or collectively, to contribute to a child's likelihood of bullying. Bullying is difficult to eradicate in schools because it is so often effectively used by students. Teachers as professionals have to deal with the consequences of pupil-on-pupil bullying. The impact of prejudice-related bullying should not be underestimated. Bullying must be recognized, understood and taken seriously. The major objectives of this study were (i)To understand the nature of bullying (ii)To find out the causes of bullying (iii) To find out impact of pupil-on-pupil bullying on students 'learning. 10 teachers and 40 students were constituted as sample of the study. Simple random sampling technique was used to select respondents. Restricted response questionnaire was used as research tool for the collection of data about prejudice-based bullying in schools. Collected data were analyzed through SPSS by running frequencies, mean score, percentage and standard deviation. The findings of the study revealed that the most commonly mentioned cause of bullying behavior was power fullness (for example, I depend on myself rather than other) and physical (for example, hitting and punching) abuse. There is an urgent need to develop anti bullying policies in schools to identify and find ways of enabling pupils to seek out the help that they needed.
