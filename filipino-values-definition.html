                                            1.Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells of animals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When this happens, the virus uses the cell’s chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible for causing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. In conclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.

2.Some scientists claim that Corona Virus can be airborne. However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.

3. Because of COVID-19 pandemic, there are safety protocols that must be followed when entering some establishments. First you must wear face mask and face shield. Next, present your quarantine pass. Then, the personnel will check your temperature. If your body temperature is 37°C and below, you can enter the establishment. After that, you will fill out a form asking for your contact information. Once done, you can proceed with your transaction but you will be asked to observe social distancing. These measures must be followed to ensure your safety and to avoid getting the virus.

4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.

                                            1. How does the speaker describe his countrymen?2. How does the speaker regard himself as a Filipino?3. If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</a>

                                            La Solidaridad was a newspaper which was published in Barcelona, Spain on February 15, 1889. It was edited by Graciano López Jaena and later on by Marcelo H. del Pilar. The social, cultural, and economic condi-tions of the colonial Philippines was published in La Solidaridad. Speeches of the Spanish liberals about the Philippines was also featured in the news-paper.La Solidaridad was established to express the goal of the Propaganda Movement towards achieving assimilation with Spain. The first issue of La Solidaridad came out on February 15, 1889. A fortnightly and a bi-weekly newspaper, La Solidaridad serves as the principal organ of the Reform Movement in Spain. Comite de Propaganda in the Philippines funded the publication of the La Solidaridad. The editorship for the newspaper was first offered to Rizal. However, he refused because during that time he was annotating Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas in Lon- don. After Rizal, Graciano López Jaena was offered for the editorship of La Solidari- dad and he accepted. On April 25, 1889, La Solidaridad published the letter entitled "The aspira- tions of the Filipinos" which was written by the Asociación Hispano-Filipina de Madrid (English: Hispanic Filipino Association of Madrid).[3] It pursued desires for: • Representation in the Cortes • Abolition of censure • An expressed and definite prohibition of the existing practices of exiling residents by purely administrative order, and without a writ of execution from the courts of justice. On December 15, 1889, Marcelo H. del Pilar replaced Graciano López Jaena as the editor of La Solidaridad. Under his editorship, the aims of the newspaper expanded. His articles caught the attention of Spanish leaders and ministers.Using propaganda, it pursued desires for: • That the Philippines be a province of Spain • Representation Filipino priests instead of Spanish friars — Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans — in parishes and remote sitios • Freedom of assembly and speech • Equal rights before the law (for both Filipino and Spanish plaintiffs) After years of publication from 1889 to 1895, funding of the La Solidaridad became scarce. Comite de Propaganda's contribution to the newspaper stopped and del Pilar funded the newspaper almost on his own.

                            5. 1. How does the speaker describe his countrymen?2. How does the speaker regard himself as a Filipino?3. If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The speaker describes his countrymen as worth dying for. An untapped resource. The Filipino men are described as free from constraints but are willing to surrender if it benefits his/her land. But, if they find injustice and abuse from the system, they would not be afraid to seek justice and peace.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>2. The speaker regards himself as a Filipino who's forgiving, patient, and has good will. But most importantly, he regards himself as a Filipino who has a deep love for his country.</p><p></p><p>3. If I were to suffer and live the way the speaker has. I would show hostility rather than seek peace and forgiveness. It may make me sound bitter, but I still haven't reached the point in life where I can afford to give forgiveness to whoever has wronged me. But in the end, I applaud the speaker's action. He seeks justice not through violence, but with peace.</p><br />

                            16. La Solidaridad was a newspaper which was published in Barcelona, Spain on February 15, 1889. It was edited by Graciano López Jaena and later on by Marcelo H. del Pilar. The social, cultural, and economic condi-tions of the colonial Philippines was published in La Solidaridad. Speeches of the Spanish liberals about the Philippines was also featured in the news-paper.La Solidaridad was established to express the goal of the Propaganda Movement towards achieving assimilation with Spain. The first issue of La Solidaridad came out on February 15, 1889. A fortnightly and a bi-weekly newspaper, La Solidaridad serves as the principal organ of the Reform Movement in Spain. Comite de Propaganda in the Philippines funded the publication of the La Solidaridad. The editorship for the newspaper was first offered to Rizal. However, he refused because during that time he was annotating Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas in Lon- don. After Rizal, Graciano López Jaena was offered for the editorship of La Solidari- dad and he accepted. On April 25, 1889, La Solidaridad published the letter entitled "The aspira- tions of the Filipinos" which was written by the Asociación Hispano-Filipina de Madrid (English: Hispanic Filipino Association of Madrid).[3] It pursued desires for: • Representation in the Cortes • Abolition of censure • An expressed and definite prohibition of the existing practices of exiling residents by purely administrative order, and without a writ of execution from the courts of justice. On December 15, 1889, Marcelo H. del Pilar replaced Graciano López Jaena as the editor of La Solidaridad. Under his editorship, the aims of the newspaper expanded. His articles caught the attention of Spanish leaders and ministers.Using propaganda, it pursued desires for: • That the Philippines be a province of Spain • Representation Filipino priests instead of Spanish friars — Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans — in parishes and remote sitios • Freedom of assembly and speech • Equal rights before the law (for both Filipino and Spanish plaintiffs) After years of publication from 1889 to 1895, funding of the La Solidaridad became scarce. Comite de Propaganda's contribution to the newspaper stopped and del Pilar funded the newspaper almost on his own.

                            23. 1.Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells of animals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When this happens, the virus uses the cell’s chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible for causing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. In conclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.a.

However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description3. Because of COVID-19 pandemic, there are safety protocols that must be followed when entering some establishments. First you must wear face mask and face shield. Next, present your quarantine pass. Then, the personnel will check your temperature. If your body temperature is 37°C and below, you can enter the establishment. After that, you will fill out a form asking for your contact information. Once done, you can proceed with your transaction but you will be asked to observe social distancing. These measures must be followed to ensure your safety and to avoid getting the virus.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg.
