                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>One night, I had a strange dream. I was walking through a dense forest, the trees towering above me and blocking out much of the sunlight. The air was thick with the scent of pine and the ground was soft underfoot, covered in a layer of fallen leaves.</p><p></p><p>As I walked, I began to hear a faint humming sound. It grew louder and louder, until it was almost deafening. Suddenly, I saw a clearing up ahead and I rushed towards it, eager to see what was causing the noise.</p><p></p><p>As I emerged from the trees, I was greeted by a sight unlike anything I had ever seen before. There was a giant, glowing orb floating in the center of the clearing, surrounded by a group of people with wings. They were all singing and dancing, their voices creating the humming sound that I had heard.</p><p></p><p>I stood there, awestruck, as I watched the winged people perform their strange ritual. As the orb pulsed and glowed, they moved closer and closer to it, their wings beating in unison.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the winged people noticed me and flew over to where I was standing. She smiled down at me and held out her hand. Without hesitation, I reached out and took it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, I was lifted off the ground and into the air, my feet no longer touching the earth. The winged woman and I flew towards the orb, joining the others in their dance.</p><p></p><p>As we flew, I felt a sense of joy and freedom that I had never experienced before. It was as if all of my worries and troubles had melted away, and all that mattered was the present moment.</p><p></p><p>When the dream ended, I woke up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. It was a truly magical experience that I will never forget.</p><br />

                            11. essay for dreaming in pandemic​</h2><br />
                        <p>Make a poem to content dream pandemic </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I had a dream come true last weekend, quite literally. For the first time in about six months, I was able to browse in a bookstore (one in my neighborhood that's reopened with sanitary and social distancing protocols clearly posted) while wide-awake. In the past, leaving the store without buying anything had felt like a triumph of willpower, but this time it involved some guilt. Only one other person was in the store during my visit, a clerk, and it only seemed fair to her to purchase something. Next time, for sure.</p><p></p><p>To be clear, I am not exactly wanting for reading material, but the element of wish fulfillment is intense even so. Likewise with my spouse, who reports having theater dreams. She has attended at least one play a week, on the most conservative estimate, throughout her entire adult life -- or did until this spring. Performances by excellent companies are livestreamed now, and she has been able to take theater classes online. But there’s more to going to theater than seeing a play -- a ritual-like aspect that can’t be broadcast. Browsing indulges curiosity and involves a degree of chance. The hunger is not for content but for certain qualities of experience, in part communal, that are lost or on hold for the duration.</p><p></p><p>The possibility of turning crisis into opportunity comes up in one of the essays on working from home that appears in the latest issue of the Journal of Scholarly Publishing. “How many of you,” asks Erika Dyck, a history professor at the University of Saskatchewan, “have dreamed of pressing pause on the work treadmill? I am talking about a genuine freeze-frame, reset, and rethink, or a chance to read something that isn’t directly related to a task with a deadline.”</p><p></p><p>But think again: “Let’s not kid ourselves; working from home during a pandemic is not that.” Before the pandemic, Dyck had what seemed like a modus vivendi that balanced parental responsibilities and academic work, including her role as a co-editor of the Canadian Bulletin for Medical History. “Now,” she writes, “despite being relatively isolated or even hiding in a home office, I consistently feel tired and am unable to focus on anything, especially when it comes to writing … My mind has constantly wandered, whether drifting toward the contents of the fridge and the looming prospect of dinner, or more often enveloping me in a fog of wondering whether any of the work we do as academics really matters, or whether we will still have academic institutions in a post-COVID world.”</p><p></p><p>Dyck’s is the most confessional of the essays and, no doubt for that reason, the one that made the most impression on me. At some point her trouble writing it became integral to what she had to say -- in particular, to acknowledging the trouble with “feeling like we need to be productive while people are dying, losing jobs, hungry and scared.”</p><p></p><p>The other four contributors to “A Compilation of Short Takes on Working from Home” recount different levels of difficulty in adjusting to the disruption. Bryan Birchmeier, an intellectual property coordinator at Michigan Publishing and the University of Michigan Press, frames it as a less physically grueling version of the phase known as “tear-down” or “total control” that he went through as in boot camp: “It’s meant to break down any barriers recruits may have to adjusting to a military schedule and to military procedures … We have had to create or adjust to a new schedule and new procedures because so much about our daily routine is different …”</p><p></p><p>At the other extreme is the experience of Olivier Lebert, the manager for two Canadian journals for 15 years, who has telecommuted for 11 of them -- and from France for the past 10. It sounds like the pandemic has not called for that much change in routine, and he can sum up best practices very clearly: establish a schedule. Stick to it. Meet deadlines. Outside your set working hours, relax: “stop responding to professional calls or emails.”</p><p></p><p>Lebert’s recommendations are sensible, and they line up closely with the advice offered in the same symposium by Sarah Buhler, an associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law, and by Kathie Porta Baker, described as “a self-employed manuscript editor, proofreader, and production assistant living and working in Northern Virginia.” But for Lebert, the boot camp-like transformation took place quite a while ago. Work at home has become second nature, though he does not indicate how long that took.</p><p></p><p>We are coming up on six months since the familiar broke. Marking the anniversary of a change sometimes helps to put it in perspective. In this case no commonly accepted date is available to punctuate time into before and after. (March 10 seems a little early, while March 15 is probably too late.) The turn was sudden, sharp, yet a blur. We make adjustments that seem to nudge things a little closer to normal, but with an uneasy awareness that there is so much more loss still to come.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dream Interpretation</p><p>Specific purpose: After hearing my speech, the audience will be able to explore more about one’s dream and start to understand how their own dreams work.</p><p>Central idea: The meaning of dream interpretation and how it really works?</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>First of all, have anyone here seen or experienced something that you might think is already happened somewhere before? I myself also experienced this kind of experience. If so, I hope that my speech can explain more and help you all to understand more about what happened and how is it relate to your dream. Of course, I will have to go over some basic stuff while hoping that everyone will stay awake.</p><p>Many dream researchers believe in universal dream symbols, that the images we see in our dreams are the same for everybody. Thus, numerous dream dictionaries are on the market. However, we believe the same image can mean different things for different people. As such a book like a dream dictionary, which gives a very specific meaning for certain images, is usually not much use. One thing here that is important to know is the author of the dream dictionary was not the author of your dream.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I have a dream to no longer be self-conscious about myself. Every day millions of teenagers go to school feeling upset about the way they are and look. I wish I could change that because the feeling is terrible and self-consciousness puts you down when you try to do your best. Not being confident about the way you look happens a lot and can bring your self-esteem down. It causes you not to stand out and interact with others; it makes you feel embarrassed about the way you look. Being self-conscious doesn't allow you to be who you really are because you are constantly trying to fix yourself for others. Most times it makes you feel like you have to be the best version of yourself and be perfect all the time. A lot of times you start to compare yourself to others and convince yourself that you can be pretty unless you look like them. What doesn't help is that others constantly bring your self-esteem down and it makes you feel unwanted. You wish everyone would think you're pretty and to be popular but it can't happen because of the way society is today.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest PO</p><p></p><br />

                            25. my dream in life essay </h2><br />
                        <p>ANSWER:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>You may dream big in life, but to achieve them, you must set long and short term goals. These goals will make you steady, taking a step at a time, without hastily jumping into all at once. For instance, I aspire to become a writer, and to make this possible, I need to graduate from a reputed institution.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone has a dream in his life which they want to achieve when they grow up. Some kids want to become rich so that they can buy anything and some want to be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. But only you know that for achieving these goals you have to work hard and stay attentive to it. In this essay on my dream, we are going to discuss the basic things that will help in achieving my dream.</p><p></p><p><strong>M</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>D</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>M</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong> </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>-</strong>essay</p><p></p><p><strong>Determination</strong></p><p>For turning a dream into reality the first thing that you need is determination. This will help you in a lot of ways. Firstly, it will help you decide the course of action for doing anything. Besides, it will also help you to plan the journey ahead. Also, it will help to take things slow and maintain a steady pace towards the dream.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no matter how big my dream planning and setting short term goals will always help. This is important because rushing to your dream will not going to help you in any way. Besides, there is some dream that requires time and they follow a process without following it you cannot achieve that dream.</p><p></p><p><strong>Staying Motivated</strong></p><p>Lack of motivation is one of the main causes that force a person to leave his dream behind. So, staying motivated is also part of the goal. And if you can’t stay positive then you won’t be able to achieve the dream. There are many people out there that quit the journey of their dreams mid-way because they lack motivation.</p><p></p><p><strong>Keep Remembering Goal</strong></p><p>For completing the dream you have to keep your dream in the mind. And remind this dream to yourself daily. There come hard times when you feel like quitting at those times just remember the goal it helps you stay positive. And if you feel like you messed up big times then start over with a fresh mind.</p><p></p><p><strong>Reward Yourself</strong></p><p>You don’t need to cover milestones to reward yourself. Set a small target towards your dream and on fulfilling them reward yourself. These rewards can be anything from toffee to your favorite thing. Besides, this is a good way of self-motivation</p><p></p><p><strong>Take Some Breaks</strong></p><p>Working towards your goal not mean that you work day and night without stopping. Apart from that, due to continuous efforts, people soon start to become de-motivated. So, taking a break will help your body and mind. For doing so, take a break in between your schedule for some time an engage yourself in other activities.</p><p></p><p><strong>Stay Among Positive People</strong></p><p>Your company affects you in a lot of ways than you can imagine. So, be with people who appreciate you and stay away from people who distract and criticize you.</p><p></p><p><strong>Don’t Hesitate to Make Mistakes</strong></p><p>We human beings fear to make mistakes but with it, we forget an important point that is a mistake helps us to learn. Whenever you make a mistake you face a tough time but these tough times helps you to polish yourself and be more determinant.</p><p></p><p>To sum it up, we can say that dreaming of a goal is far easier than achieving it. And for fulfilling your dream you need a lot of things and also have to sacrifice many things.</p><p></p><p>Above all, for fulfilling your dream plan and work according to it because it will lead you to the right path. And never forget to dream big because they help in overcoming every obstacle in life.</p><p> </p><p>:)</p><br />

                        Every member of my ideal society has a voice. Everyone has a place to express their ideas, emotions, and opinions. The heart of the place I'd like to live is freedom of speech. In a lot of respects, this is true in the world I live in. The difference between my fantasy world and reality is that everyone can recognize the strength of their own voice. Not only in terms of material, but also in terms of presentation.<br /><br />In my ideal world, we will teach this to children as part of their daily education so that as adults, they would comfortably and openly contribute to society. Children can do this in the world we live in through extracurricular activities. Many who participate in the artistic and expressive arts are more likely to be comfortable with their own voices.<br /><br />We free our speech by learning these things. We express our ideas by allowing ourselves to speak freely. We develop and expand our communities by sharing our ideas. <br /><br />My ideal world isn't as far-fetched as it may seem. Perhaps yours isn't, either.<br /><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In my dream society, all members have a voice. Everyone has a space to share their opinions, thoughts and feelings. Freedom of speech is the essence of the place I’d like to inhabit. In most ways, this is in place in the world I inhabit. However, the difference between my dream world and reality is that everyone has the ability to understand the power of their voice. Not just in the content, but in the vocal mechanism itself.</p><p></p><p>Through teaching for the last ten years, it has become apparent to me, that most people think that individuals are gifted with a beautiful speaking voice. A voice that eases into their listener’s ears and transports us with their stories, awakens us with their ideas and moves us with their view. Maybe some people are lucky to have been born with this skill. However I believe that everyone can unleash this marvellous power and use their voice to their full potential, if they are shown how.</p><p></p><p>#Brainliest</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Dream</p><p>I picture myself center stage in the most enormous and fantastically beautiful theater in the world. Its walls and ceilings are covered in impeccable Victorian paintings of angels in the sky. A single ray of light shines down upon my face, shining through the still, silent darkness, and all attention is on me and me alone. The theater is a packed house; however, my audience is not that of human beings, but rather the angels from the paintings on the walls come alive, sitting intently in the rows of plush seats. Their warmth encompasses my body, and I know at that moment that it is time to begin.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps </p><p></p><p>#KEEP ON LEARNING </p><br />
