The logical arrangement of Ideas is known as the pattern of paragraph13. In determining the pattern of development of ideas, note the signal words used.14. The signal words may help you identify the pattern of development, but it is more important that youunderstand the meaning of text15. "In the meantime" is a signal word for comparing,16.

Cohesive devices are sentences that clarify and prove the main idea21. Unlike a paragraph, an essay has a more elaborate structure22. Unity is achieved when a composition contains several distinct ideas.23. Cohesion occurs when ideas are connected at the conceptual or Idea level. It can be seen through well-defended arguments and organized points.24. Coherence is the connection of ideas at the sentence level. It can be readily seen in a text through the smoothflow of the sentences and the connection of the ideas.25. The technical aspect of writing, also known as mechanics, should not be overlooked when writing. The use ofcontractions (eg, shouldn't) is encouraged and numbers from zero to ten should be spelled out while numbershigher than ten should be written In figures.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A good marketing strategy helps you define your vision, mission and business goals, and outlines the steps you need to take to achieve these goals. Your marketing strategy affects the way you run your entire business, so it should be planned and developed in consultation with your team.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A problem that runs a close second has these individuals struggling with the idea of how to conduct marketing without going broke in the process. Because every dollar counts, marketing often seems to be something they simply cannot afford.</p><p></p><p>However, the opposite is true in most cases. Businesses that are not doing as well as others typically need to increase their marketing efforts.  Spending the right money in the right marketing strategies can drive the success of your business.</p><p></p><p>There are many new marketing tactics and media that have emerged in recent years. Be careful, not all of them are particularly effective for all types of businesses. With so much buzz about digital and web marketing, many traditional business owners are asking themselves if traditional marketing is even still alive.</p><p></p><p>Rest assured, it is alive and well! You just have to know where to look for it.</p><p></p><p>Traditional Marketing Methods</p><p></p><p>Traditional methods of marketing typically involve advertising through newspapers, magazines, telephone books, radio, and TV.  These ads are typically placed for a fee which corresponds to the size of the ad, as well as the medium in which it is published.</p><p></p><p>In years past, when almost all individuals read the local newspaper or received a new phone book every year, these were solid media or marketing channels on which many business owners could rely. However, this is rapidly changing. More and more people are choosing to get their news online rather than through the newspaper, and a large number of households no longer take telephone books, since it is often easier to simply look numbers up online.</p><p></p><p>Even popular magazines have fallen prey to the Internet age. Many of these magazines do not have the same circulation numbers they once had. They too have been forced to adapt to the constantly changing world of technology, and in doing so, advertising opportunities for business owners who had previously found success through placing ads in these magazines have changed.</p><p></p><p>In some instances, the change has been favorable -- desperate to retain print advertisers, many newspapers and magazines has been forced lower prices.  Conversely, ultra popular publications have created a restricted availability that rivals Superbowl commercial status.</p><p></p><p>Lastly and sadly, many smaller publications that support local business and provided hometown advertising options have folded, forcing business owners to find affordable alternatives.</p><p></p><p>New Marketing Opportunities</p><p></p><p>Although many of the traditional marketing opportunities have either completely disappeared or changed dramatically, there are still opportunities available for those business owners who do not want to venture into an entirely new and unfamiliar world of Internet marketing.</p><p></p><p>Sponsorships of local and regional events can be very lucrative for business owners. They are typically relatively inexpensive, and can be tailored to your advertising budget. This is where you can capitalize, as you are getting your name out without spending a ton of money.</p><p></p><p>The biggest potential payoff with this type of marketing is that your potential customers now associate you and your business with the community.</p><p></p><p>Local radio, cable TV, and billboards are all viable options for business owners with larger marketing budgets.  If you have driven the 1-95 corridor, you will always remember the multitude of billboards for South of the Border.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            4. ESSAY 1. What is the difference between traditional and contemporary marketing? 2. Provide an example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach and describe the content of its message, Do you think this is an effective marketing strategy? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>Traditional marketing and contemporary marketing are two different approaches to promoting products and services. Here are some of the main differences between the two:</p><p></p><p>1.Channels: Traditional marketing primarily uses traditional channels such as print, radio, and television ads, while contemporary marketing relies heavily on digital channels such as social media, email, and mobile marketing. </p><p></p><p>2.Audience: Traditional marketing often targets a broad audience, whereas contemporary marketing focuses on niche markets and personalized targeting.</p><p></p><p>3.Communication: Traditional marketing is often one-way communication, with the company broadcasting its message to the audience. In contrast, contemporary marketing is two-way communication, with customers engaging with the brand and providing feedback.</p><p></p><p>4.Metrics: Traditional marketing relies on metrics such as reach and frequency, while contemporary marketing uses metrics such as engagement, conversions, and return on investment (ROI).</p><p></p><p>5.Cost: Traditional marketing can be more expensive due to the cost of production and distribution of physical materials, such as billboards and print ads. In contrast, contemporary marketing can be more cost-effective due to the ability to target specific audiences and the lower cost of digital advertising.</p><p></p><p>Overall, contemporary marketing is more focused on personalization, engagement, and data-driven insights, while traditional marketing is often characterized by a broader focus and mass media channels. Both approaches can be effective, depending on the target audience, product or service, and marketing goals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For the second question </p><p>Provide an example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach and describe the content of its message, Do you think this is an effective marketing strategy? Why or why not?</p><p></p><p></p><p>One example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach is a car commercial that highlights the vehicle's safety features and durability. The message of the ad typically revolves around the idea that the car is the safest and most reliable option on the market, and that customers who choose this car are making a smart and responsible choice for themselves and their families. The content of the message might include statistics about the car's safety ratings, testimonials from satisfied customers, and dramatic visuals of the car driving in extreme conditions or avoiding accidents. The tone of the ad is often urgent and persuasive, emphasizing the importance of making the right choice when it comes to safety and reliability.Whether or not this is an effective marketing strategy depends on a few factors. On the one hand, the hard sell approach can be effective in convincing customers to make a purchase by creating a sense of urgency and emphasizing the benefits of the product. By highlighting the safety and reliability of the car, the ad is appealing to customers who are looking for a long-term investment and are willing to pay a premium for quality.On the other hand, the hard sell approach can also be off-putting to some customers, who may feel that they are being manipulated or pressured into making a purchase. Additionally, the ad may not be effective in reaching customers who are not interested in safety and reliability as their primary concerns when choosing a car.Overall, while the hard sell approach can be effective in certain situations, it is not always the best strategy for every product or audience. Marketers should carefully consider their target audience and messaging goals before deciding whether to use a hard sell approach or another marketing strategy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Miss q na sya super</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

"Iphone 12 Pro Max has many features that make it stand outthe market" is a thesis statement that showscomparison-and-contrast pattem9. "Although Instagram and Twitter have significant similarities they also have striking differences" is a thesisstatement that shows comparison-and-contrast pattern10. Using a Venn Diagram is the best way to Illustrate the comparison-and-contrast paragraph11. Ideas in writing a comparison-and-contrast paragraph could be arranged side-by-sidewhich means all thedetails in first item will be described thoroughly followed by the descriptions of second Item12. The logical arrangement of Ideas is known as the pattern of paragraph13. In determining the pattern of development of ideas, note the signal words used.14. The signal words may help you identify the pattern of development, but it is more important that youunderstand the meaning of text15. "In the meantime" is a signal word for comparing,16. Various factors must be considered in identifying the effectiveness of a particular text.17. Knowing the components of a text or composition to further understand the properties of a well-written text isoptional.18. A composition can either be a paragraph or an essay. A paragraph is a group of Interrelated sentences thattalk about one main idea while an essay is a group of paragraphs thattalk about one central idea.19. In an essay, the body begins with the restatement of the thesis statement using a different structure andwording to uphold the language style.20. Cohesive devices are sentences that clarify and prove the main idea21. Unlike a paragraph, an essay has a more elaborate structure22. Unity is achieved when a composition contains several distinct ideas.23. Cohesion occurs when ideas are connected at the conceptual or Idea level. It can be seen through well-defended arguments and organized points.24. Coherence is the connection of ideas at the sentence level. It can be readily seen in a text through the smoothflow of the sentences and the connection of the ideas.25. The technical aspect of writing, also known as mechanics, should not be overlooked when writing. The use ofcontractions (eg, shouldn't) is encouraged and numbers from zero to ten should be spelled out while numbershigher than ten should be written In figures.​</h2><br />
