                            4. Write an original speech about the current pandemic (500 words)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020</p><br />

                            5. why should I not give up? 500 words speech​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"I should not give up"</p><p></p><p>Right now, I am breathing, trying to think about the world. Many are dying, many are starving, many are homeless, but I, right now is lying on the bed. I am relaxing. I am doing things that others cannot do, I have shelter, I have food, I have every needs that a human should have, while many people out there doesn't have these. I have parents, family, relatives that believes I can do everything, that I can achieve greatness, that I can be a star one day. Many are expecting me to become a man. Add the fact that I have a dream, to have a family, marry my love one, create and construct my own dream house. Live and travel without restrictions, those are some things that I want on life. I want to be a more mature person, I want to help people, I want to show that I could somehow help and change the world. Even by a small step, being a role model. I have friends, peers go laugh with, friends to with, talk to when something's bothering me. Many people are around me, many people love me, many people wouldn't want me to fail, many sees me as an asset, and sometime an enemy or competitor, but in this life I always would want to do my best even if I do not win a race or a contest. </p><p>With all of that said, I should not give up because as long as there's life and someone's beside you, there is always hope, find solutions to problems, I want to find solutions so that people could live well. Right now, I can't give up, many people are suffering.</p><br />

Food security refers to the availability, accessibility, and affordability of nutritious food for all individuals. As the world's population continues to grow, it is essential that we find ways to produce more food while also protecting the environment and preserving natural resources. Sustainable agriculture practices are key to achieving this goal.</p><p></p><p>Sustainable agriculture is a holistic approach to farming that takes into account the environmental, economic, and social impacts of food production. It involves using techniques that minimize the use of synthetic inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and instead focus on building healthy soil and promoting biodiversity. This approach also prioritizes the well-being of farmers and their communities by ensuring fair wages and working conditions.</p><p></p><p>One of the main benefits of sustainable agriculture is that it helps to preserve natural resources and protect the environment. Conventional farming practices often rely heavily on the use of synthetic inputs, which can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. In contrast, sustainable agriculture practices such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and conservation tillage help to build healthy soil, reduce erosion, and preserve natural habitats.</p><p></p><p>In addition to protecting the environment, sustainable agriculture also helps to ensure food security by increasing the productivity of small-scale farmers. Many small-scale farmers around the world lack access to the resources and technologies needed to increase their yields. Sustainable agriculture practices, such as agroforestry and intercropping, can help to increase productivity and income for small-scale farmers, which in turn can help to improve food security in these communities.</p><p></p><p>Another benefit of sustainable agriculture is that it can help to reduce poverty and promote social justice. The majority of the world's small-scale farmers are women, who often face additional challenges such as lack of access to land, credit, and training. Sustainable agriculture practices can help to empower women farmers by providing them with the resources and training they need to increase their productivity and income.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sustainable agriculture is a critical aspect of achieving food security for the growing global population. It helps to protect the environment, increase productivity, and promote social justice. Governments, international organizations, and the private sector all have a role to play in supporting sustainable agriculture practices and promoting food security. By working together, we can ensure that all people have access to nutritious food and that our planet remains healthy for future generations.</p><br />

                        <p>500+ Words Essay on Earthquake</p><p></p><p>Simply speaking, Earthquake means the shaking of the Earth’s surface. It is a sudden trembling of the surface of the Earth. Earthquakes certainly are a terrible natural disaster. Furthermore, Earthquakes can cause huge damage to life and property. Some Earthquakes are weak in nature and probably go unnoticed. In contrast, some Earthquakes are major and violent. The major Earthquakes are almost always devastating in nature. Most noteworthy, the occurrence of an Earthquake is quite unpredictable. This is what makes them so dangerous.</p><p>   Types of Earthquake</p><p></p><p>Tectonic Earthquake: The Earth’s crust comprises of the slab of rocks of uneven shapes. These slab of rocks are tectonic plates. Furthermore, there is energy stored here. This energy causes tectonic plates to push away from each other or towards each other. As time passes, the energy and movement build up pressure between two plates.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this enormous pressure causes the fault line to form. Also, the center point of this disturbance is the focus of the Earthquake. Consequently, waves of energy travel from focus to the surface. This results in shaking of the surface.</p><p></p><p>Volcanic Earthquake: This Earthquake is related to volcanic activity. Above all, the magnitude of such Earthquakes is weak. These Earthquakes are of two types. The first type is Volcano-tectonic earthquake. Here tremors occur due to injection or withdrawal of Magma. In contrast, the second type is Long-period earthquake. Here Earthquake occurs due to the pressure changes among the Earth’s layers.</p><p></p><p>Collapse Earthquake: These Earthquakes occur in the caverns and mines. Furthermore, these Earthquakes are of weak magnitude. Undergrounds blasts are probably the cause of collapsing of mines. Above all, this collapsing of mines causes seismic waves. Consequently, these seismic waves cause an Earthquake.</p><p></p><p>Explosive Earthquake: These Earthquakes almost always occur due to the testing of nuclear weapons. When a nuclear weapon detonates, a big blast occurs. This results in the release of a huge amount of energy. This probably results in Earthquakes.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Title: The Importance of Freedom of Expression in a Democracy</p><p></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Today, I would like to talk to you about the importance of freedom of expression in a democracy. As we all know, freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that allows individuals to express themselves freely without fear of censorship or punishment. It is a cornerstone of any democratic society, and it is essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy.</p><p></p><p>A democracy is built on the principle of the people's participation in governance. And for the people to participate effectively, they need to have access to information and the ability to express their opinions. This is where freedom of expression comes in. It allows individuals to voice their opinions, share their ideas, and participate in public discourse. Without this freedom, the people are not able to hold their leaders accountable and make informed decisions.</p><p></p><p>Freedom of expression also plays a crucial role in promoting diversity and tolerance. In a society where different voices are heard, people are exposed to different perspectives and ideas. This exposure helps to break down stereotypes and prejudices, and it allows people to understand and appreciate the diversity of human experience. Moreover, it allows people to learn from the mistakes of the past and to build a better future.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, freedom of expression is essential for the development of science, art and culture. When people are free to express themselves, they are able to create new ideas, new technologies, and new forms of art. This creativity and innovation is what drives the growth and development of society. Without freedom of expression, society would be stagnant and backward.</p><p></p><p>However, it is important to remember that freedom of expression is not an absolute right. It is a right that comes with responsibilities. People must use this freedom responsibly, and they must respect the rights of others. They must also be aware that certain forms of expression, such as hate speech, are not protected by the freedom of expression and can lead to serious consequences.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, freedom of expression is a fundamental right that is essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy. It allows individuals to participate effectively in governance, promotes diversity and tolerance, and drives the development of science, art, and culture. We must all work together to protect and promote this right, and to use it responsibly. Thank you.</p><br />

                            14. persuasive speech about teenage pregnancy 500 words or 5 paragraph</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Teenage pregnancy is a critical issue that demands our attention. It is a problem that affects not only the teenager, but also the child they are carrying and society as a whole. Today, I want to persuade you that teenage pregnancy is a significant issue and that we must take action to address it.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, let's talk about the impact of teenage pregnancy on the teenager. It is a well-known fact that teenage mothers often face numerous challenges in their personal and professional lives. They have a higher likelihood of dropping out of school, which results in lower job prospects and incomes. Teenage mothers often face financial instability, which can lead to a vicious cycle of poverty. Additionally, teenage pregnancy has physical and emotional risks for the teenager, including a higher chance of health complications, postpartum depression, and a lack of readiness for parenthood.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, teenage pregnancy is not just a problem for the teenagers involved. It is a societal issue that has a significant economic cost. It is estimated that teenage pregnancy costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year in healthcare, social welfare, and lost productivity. Furthermore, teenage mothers are more likely to depend on government assistance programs, such as welfare and food stamps, which puts a strain on the resources that could be used elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, we need to address the issue of teenage pregnancy because it affects the children born to teenage mothers. Children born to teenage mothers often face health problems and developmental delays due to their mothers' lack of prenatal care and inadequate nutrition. Moreover, they are more likely to have behavioral and academic problems in their childhood, leading to negative consequences throughout their lives.</p><p></p><p>Fourthly, we must address the issue of teenage pregnancy because it is a preventable problem. There are many effective programs and policies that can reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancy. Comprehensive sex education, access to contraception, and community outreach programs have all been shown to be effective in reducing teenage pregnancy rates. Moreover, parental involvement and support can help to educate teenagers about the risks of teenage pregnancy and the importance of responsible sexual behavior.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, addressing teenage pregnancy is a matter of social justice. It is a problem that disproportionately affects young people from low-income and marginalized communities. These young people often lack access to resources and opportunities that could help them avoid teenage pregnancy. By addressing this issue, we are fighting for the rights of all young people to have access to the resources and opportunities they need to succeed.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, teenage pregnancy is a critical issue that we must address. It has a significant impact on the teenagers involved, their children, and society as a whole. We need to support comprehensive sex education, access to contraception, and community outreach programs to prevent teenage pregnancy. We must work together to ensure that all young people have access to the resources and opportunities they need to succeed. Thank you for your attention.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>PANDEMIC<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>pandemic </strong>is a pestilence of an irresistible sickness that has spread across an enormous area, for example various landmasses or around the world, influencing a significant number of people. A far and wide endemic sickness with a steady number of contaminated people is certainly not a <strong>pandemic</strong>. Far reaching endemic illnesses with a steady number of contaminated people, for example, repeats of occasional flu are for the most part avoided as they happen all the while in enormous locales of the globe rather than being spread around the world.
</p><p> All through mankind's set of experiences, there have been various <strong>pandemics</strong> of illnesses like smallpox. The most deadly <strong>pandemic</strong> in written history was the Dark Passing, which killed an expected 75–200 million individuals in the fourteenth century. The term was not utilized at this point however was for later pandemics including the 1918 flu <strong>pandemic.</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>In getting ready for a potential flu pandemic, the WHO distributed an archive on<strong> pandemic</strong> readiness direction in 1999, updated in 2005 and 2009, characterizing stages and suitable activities for each stage in an assistant mémoire named WHO pandemic stage depictions and primary activities by stage. The 2009 modification, including depictions of a pandemic and the stages prompting its statement, was settled in February 2009.</p><p></p><p>How can you be a good citizen in your home during pandemic?:

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Almost all theories of human development agree upon the fact that society is the key factor in the development of a human being. This is what teaches people to learn how the world is organized and structured by means of communication and provides them with the possibility to evaluate themselves through the perception of other individuals. However, I strongly disagree that society is the key factor in shaping a personality.<p></p>First, it starts influencing a person only after a certain age, usually when an individual is not younger than three, which means that the basis of the personality has already been shaped by the family. It means that the community will undoubtedly influence the character, values, and ideas of a person, but only up to a point where it will face the barrier of the values acquired in a family.<p></p>Further on, I firmly believe that any person has a definite set of inborn features and inclinations. If you try to observe even a very little baby, you will see that even at the youngest possible age, they possess their unique personality, being calm or active, stubborn or obedient, cautious or reckless. These features can be modified and changed slightly, but it is absolutely impossible to eliminate them completely.<p></p>So, despite the huge influence of society on the formation of a human being as a personality, the leading role still belongs to the family and nature. The person is born with a personality, and what we can do as teachers and parents is only adapt it slightly.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>@CarryonLearning<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>THIS IS MY OWN ESSAY IN MY PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>Teenage pregnancy is a significant issue that affects many families and communities around the world. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 16 million teenage girls give birth each year, and the majority of these pregnancies occur in developing countries. While teenage pregnancy rates have declined in some regions, it remains a serious problem that can have long-term consequences for the health and well-being of young mothers and their children.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, teenage pregnancy can have negative effects on the physical health of young mothers. Adolescent girls who become pregnant are at higher risk for complications during pregnancy and childbirth, including premature delivery and low birth weight. These health risks can lead to long-term health problems for both the mother and child. Additionally, young mothers may not have access to adequate healthcare or prenatal care, which can further exacerbate health issues.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, teenage pregnancy can have negative effects on the social and economic well-being of young mothers. Many teenage mothers drop out of school, limiting their opportunities for future education and employment. This can lead to poverty and financial instability for both the mother and her child. Furthermore, teenage pregnancy can strain family relationships and community resources, as young mothers may require support and assistance from others.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, teenage pregnancy can have negative effects on the emotional well-being of young mothers. Adolescence is a time of emotional development, and teenage mothers may struggle with feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression. These emotional struggles can lead to difficulties in parenting, which can affect the well-being of the child.</p><p></p><p>So, what can be done to prevent teenage pregnancy? Education is the key. Young people need access to accurate and comprehensive information about sex education, reproductive health, and contraception. Schools and community organizations can provide education and resources to help prevent unintended pregnancies among adolescents. Additionally, parents and caregivers can play an important role in educating their children about healthy relationships, sexuality, and pregnancy prevention.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, access to affordable and effective contraception is essential in preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents. Governments and healthcare providers must prioritize making contraception widely available and accessible to young people. This can include providing free or low-cost contraceptives, as well as increasing access to sexual and reproductive health services.</p><p></p><p>Finally, we must work to reduce the social stigma surrounding teenage pregnancy. Young mothers should not be shamed or ostracized for their choices, and we must provide support and resources to help them succeed. This includes access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, teenage pregnancy is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. We must work to educate young people about sex education and contraception, provide access to affordable healthcare and contraceptives, and reduce the social stigma surrounding teenage pregnancy. By taking action on these fronts, we can help prevent unintended pregnancies among adolescents and support the health and well-being of young mothers and their children. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to address a crucial issue that affects the lives of millions of young people around the world - teenage pregnancy. This problem is not only limited to developing countries but also affects many developed countries, including the United States.</p><p></p><p>Teenage pregnancy refers to the pregnancy of a girl who is aged between 13 to 19 years. According to the World Health Organization, around 16 million teenage girls give birth each year, accounting for 11 percent of all births worldwide. This is a staggering figure that highlights the magnitude of this problem.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant consequences of teenage pregnancy is the health risks associated with it. Teenage mothers are more likely to experience complications during pregnancy and childbirth, such as premature birth, low birth weight, and high blood pressure. These risks can have long-lasting effects on the health of the mother and the child, leading to chronic health issues and developmental delays.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, teenage pregnancy can have a profound impact on the education and economic opportunities of the mother. Many teenage mothers drop out of school to take care of their babies, making it difficult for them to obtain higher education and better-paying jobs in the future. This can lead to a cycle of poverty and limited opportunities that can be difficult to break.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, teenage pregnancy can also have a significant impact on the mental health of the mother. Teenage mothers are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, which can impact their ability to care for their babies and themselves. This can lead to a range of negative outcomes for both the mother and the baby, including neglect and abuse.</p><p></p><p>It is, therefore, essential that we take action to address teenage pregnancy. One of the most effective ways to do this is to provide comprehensive sex education to teenagers. This education should include information about contraception, healthy relationships, and the consequences of unprotected sex. It should also include information about the resources available to pregnant teenagers, such as prenatal care and parenting classes.</p><p></p><p>In addition to providing sex education, we also need to ensure that teenagers have access to affordable and effective contraception. This can help to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the number of teenage mothers. It is also important to provide access to safe and legal abortion services for those who need it.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, we need to create a supportive and inclusive environment for teenage mothers. This can include providing access to child care services, flexible work and school schedules, and financial assistance to help them complete their education and obtain better-paying jobs.</p><p></p><p>However, we cannot address teenage pregnancy in isolation. We also need to address the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to this problem. This includes poverty, lack of access to education and health care, and gender inequality. We must work together to create a world where young people, especially girls, have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, teenage pregnancy is a complex and challenging issue that requires the attention and action of everyone. We must provide comprehensive sex education, access to contraception and safe abortion services, create a supportive environment for teenage mothers, and address the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to this problem. By doing so, we can help to reduce the number of teenage pregnancies and ensure that all young people have the opportunity to achieve their full potential.

                        <p> </p><p></p><p> </p>"End Body Shaming"<p></p><p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight, I want to talk to you about a subject that affects us all in one way or another - body shaming.</p><p></p><p>Body shaming is defined as the act of criticizing or mocking someone's physical appearance. It can take many forms, including derogatory comments, taunts, and bullying. It can happen in person, online, or through the media. No matter how it happens, body shaming can have devastating effects on a person's mental and emotional health.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, body shaming can lead to low self-esteem. When someone is constantly told that they are not attractive, not skinny enough, or not muscular enough, they begin to internalize those messages. They start to believe that they are not good enough or worthy of love and respect. This can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, body shaming can also lead to eating disorders. Many people who are body-shamed resort to extreme measures to change their appearance. This can include over-exercising, starving themselves, or binge eating. These behaviors can have serious consequences for their physical and emotional health.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, body shaming can also create a toxic environment in which people are judged solely on their appearance. This can lead to discrimination and prejudice, as people are treated differently based on their weight, skin color, or other physical attributes. This can have long-lasting effects on people's lives, as they may be denied opportunities or face barriers because of their appearance.</p><p></p><p>We need to put an end to body shaming. The first step is to recognize that everyone is different and that there is no one "ideal" body type. We should celebrate diversity and embrace our differences, rather than trying to conform to a narrow beauty standard. We need to focus on healthy habits, such as eating well and exercising regularly, rather than trying to attain a specific weight or body shape.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, we should speak out against body shaming whenever we see it. This can be as simple as telling someone that their comments are hurtful or sharing positive messages on social media. We can also support organizations that promote body positivity and work to eliminate body shaming.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, body shaming is a serious problem that affects us all. We need to recognize the harm that it causes and work together to eliminate it. By celebrating diversity, promoting healthy habits, and speaking out against body shaming, we can create a more accepting and inclusive world. Thank you.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>"It is said that the best way to learn a language is to speak it. I believe that the best way to learn about a language is to live in it. My father and mother moved to the Philippines in the year 1999. Before they moved, I knew how to speak and write English. When I moved here, I was a second language in a land of many languages. But, I learned to speak Filipino and I have been learning how to write Filipino ever since I came here. It has been a long, painful journey, but a journey worth taking. As you begin your journey in the Philippines, I encourage you to explore everything, learn how to speak and write and live here.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear fellow learners,</p><p></p><p>I stand here today to talk about one of the most important aspects of our lives: Education. Education is not only about obtaining degrees or securing jobs; it is a lifelong process of learning, growing, and evolving as individuals. It is about discovering our true potential, and leveraging it to make a positive impact on the world around us. Education is, in many ways, the foundation upon which we build our lives.</p><p></p><p>The importance of education cannot be overstated. It is the key to success and unlocks countless opportunities. It provides us with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate through life’s challenges, both personal and professional. Education teaches us critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making, which are all vital skills for success in any field. It helps us develop a sense of curiosity, creativity, and innovation, which are crucial in today’s rapidly changing world.</p><p></p><p>Education is not only crucial for individual success but also for the betterment of society. Education provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute positively to society. It enables them to make informed decisions, participate in democratic processes, and contribute to the economy. Education promotes social equality by providing opportunities to those who would otherwise be left behind. Education is, therefore, a fundamental right that should be accessible to all.</p><p></p><p>However, despite its undeniable importance, education is not always accessible to all. There are still many people around the world who are deprived of the opportunity to receive an education. Lack of access to education is one of the biggest barriers to social and economic mobility. It perpetuates poverty, inequality, and marginalization. It is the responsibility of all of us to work towards ensuring that every person has access to education.</p><p></p><p>We also need to rethink the way we approach education. Traditional education systems have long been criticized for being outdated, rigid, and not reflective of the real world. Education should be more than just memorizing facts and figures; it should be about developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. It should encourage students to be curious, to ask questions, and to challenge conventional wisdom. Education should be inclusive, diverse, and equitable. It should cater to the individual needs of students and provide them with a well-rounded education that prepares them for the real world.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, education is the foundation upon which we build our lives. It is a fundamental right that should be accessible to all. Education is not only crucial for individual success but also for the betterment of society. We need to work towards ensuring that every person has access to education and rethinking the way we approach education. It is only by doing so that we can create a better, more equitable, and more just society. So let us all commit to working towards a world where education is accessible to all, and where everyone has the opportunity to realize their full potential.</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><br />
