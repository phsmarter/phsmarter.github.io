                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Key findings ↑</p><p>In this factsheet we identify some of the main types, sources, and claims of COVID-19 misinformation seen so far. We analyse a sample of 225 pieces of misinformation rated false or misleading by fact-checkers and published in English between January and the end of March 2020, drawn from a collection of fact-checks maintained by First Draft.</p><p></p><p>We find that:</p><p></p><p>In terms of scale, independent fact-checkers have moved quickly to respond to the growing amount of misinformation around COVID-19; the number of English-language fact-checks rose more than 900% from January to March. (As fact-checkers have limited resources and cannot check all problematic content, the total volume of different kinds of coronavirus misinformation has almost certainly grown even faster.)</p><p>In terms of formats, most (59%) of the misinformation in our sample involves various forms of reconfiguration, where existing and often true information is spun, twisted, recontextualised, or reworked. Less misinformation (38%) was completely fabricated. Despite a great deal of recent concern, we find no examples of deep fakes in our sample. Instead, the manipulated content includes ‘cheap fakes’ produced using much simpler tools. The reconfigured misinformation accounts for 87% of social media interactions in the sample; the fabricated content, for 12%.</p><p>In terms of sources, top-down misinformation from politicians, celebrities, and other prominent public figures made up just 20% of the claims in our sample but accounted for 69% of total social media engagement. While the majority of misinformation on social media came from ordinary people, most of these posts seemed to generate far less engagement. However, a few instances of bottom-up misinformation garnered a large reach and our analysis is unable to capture spread in private groups and via messaging applications, likely platforms for significant amounts of bottom-up misinformation.</p><p>In terms of claims, misleading or false claims about the actions or policies of public authorities, including government and international bodies like the WHO or the UN, are the single largest category of claims identified, appearing in 39% of our sample.</p><p>In terms of responses, social media platforms have responded to a majority of the social media posts rated false by fact-checkers by removing them or attaching various warnings. There is significant variation from company to company, however. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>☺️</p><br />

1. Write a 1000 words essay regarding the dependence on the use of the Internet as a source of information.
2. Discuss its advantages and disadvantages and its reliability and credibility.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>he advancements in technology have changed our lives in several ways, including how we communicate, how we do business, how we run our social and personal lives, etc. Thanks to the internet and the World Wide Web, the earth is now a global village. However, like the two sides of the coin, there are always some disadvantages of the internet and the technology.
</p><p>
</p><p>Let’s see the disadvantages of the internet in the following paragraphs:
</p><p>
</p><p>Spamming:
</p><p>
</p><p>Spamming is the dumping of bulk e-mails which are not solicited by the users. These e-mails can clog the whole system and serve no purpose. The spam e-mails can also contain potential threats like viruses, details of illegal activities, or soliciting money from the users.
</p><p>
</p><p>Information theft:
</p><p>
</p><p>The internet contains everything and anything freely available. These opportunities pave way for misuse of information. We may also have come across situations where people steal information from someone’s research and share it as their own.
</p><p>
</p><p>Identity theft and security breach:
</p><p>
</p><p>This is one of the scariest disadvantages of internet. People’s identities are stolen and misused and at times, their privacy and security are breached to an extent that many people lose their lives or money because of this terrifying loophole on the internet.
</p><p>
</p><p>Impact on children:
</p><p>
</p><p>Continuous surfing and the variety of games found on the internet make the children addicted to the internet. Children tend to constantly use the system and thereby, their communication potential and attitude changes, are hampered to a great extent. This is another major disadvantage of the internet that is a sure shot possibility of spoiling the next generation. The violence in the games also affects the psychology of the children. Additionally, the adult contents that are freely available on the internet share unwanted and wrong information about sexuality and related things.
</p><p>
</p><p>Impact on the health:
</p><p>
</p><p>Apart from these, the continuous use of the internet can cause lifestyle disorders not only for the children but also for adults. Sitting in front of the computer for a prolonged time can affect your eyesight, cause obesity and related disorders. People tend to lose their productive time and get addicted to internet surfing. Such usage is considered as another major disadvantage of the internet because it hampers the productive time and quality time in the workplace and at home.
</p><p>
</p><p>Depression:
</p><p>
</p><p>Although the internet is extensively used in the workplace, it can cause depression in human minds. Considering the availability of internet and VPN with which you can access your office materials from anywhere, a working person is expected to be available for the job throughout the day and night. These facilities, in the long run, can cause depression waves not only in the minds of those who work but also in the minds of those who are dependent on these working personnel. Spending quality time with our loved ones reduce to a greater extent. People tend to become more mechanical and there is a definite loss of emotions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

It involves the exploration, analysis, and interpretation of various sources to gain knowledge and understanding about a particular subject.</p><p></p><p>2.

                        <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Local Heritage: The Redwood Trees of Northern California</p><p></p><p>Importance: </p><p></p><p>The redwood trees of Northern California are one of the most iconic symbols of the state and hold great significance for its residents. These trees have been a part of California’s natural landscape for thousands of years and have had a profound impact on the environment, culture, and economy of the region.</p><p></p><p>History:</p><p></p><p> The redwoods of Northern California are among the oldest living organisms on the planet, with some trees exceeding 2,000 years in age. Native American tribes that have lived in the region for centuries have used these trees for medicinal and spiritual purposes, while early European settlers prized them for their timber, which was used to build homes, furniture, and ships. Today, the redwoods are a major attraction for tourists and nature lovers, drawing millions of visitors to the area every year.</p><p></p><p>Influence on Culture:</p><p></p><p> The redwood trees have become a symbol of California’s natural beauty and are often featured in artwork, literature, and music. They have also contributed to the development of the state’s environmental movement, which has sought to protect these majestic trees from logging and other forms of destruction. Additionally, the redwoods have played an important role in shaping the local economy, with many communities depending on tourism and outdoor recreation for their livelihoods.</p><p></p><p>Views of Family Members: </p><p></p><p>My family has always been enamored with the redwoods and has made it a point to visit these trees whenever we have the chance. We see them as a source of natural wonder and believe that they are one of California’s most important treasures.</p><p></p><p>Information from Social and Print Media:</p><p></p><p> News articles and social media posts have highlighted the beauty and cultural importance of the redwoods, as well as the ongoing efforts to protect them from environmental threats. These sources have also shared stories of individuals and communities who have been impacted by the redwoods, either through tourism or other economic opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Information from Other Sources: </p><p></p><p>Scientific studies have shown that the redwoods play a vital role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and helping to combat climate change. Additionally, organizations such as the Save the Redwoods League and the National Park Service have worked to protect and preserve these trees for future generations.</p><p></p><br />
