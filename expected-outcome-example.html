Write your answer on the space provided before the number.__________ 1. Effective classroom management principles work across almost all subject areas and grade levels (Brophy, 2006; Lewis, et al., 2006).__________ 2. Although effective classroom management produces a variety of positive outcomes for students, according to a 2006 survey of pre-K through grade 12 teachers conducted by APA, teachers report a lack of support in implementing classroom management strategies.__________ 3. Chaotic classroom environments are a large issue for teachers and can contribute to high teacher stress and burnout rates.__________ 4. It is important to use effective classroom management strategies at the universal level in a tiered model, as they serve as both prevention and intervention methods that promote positive outcomes for teachers. __________ 5. At the school wide level, teachers and staff create a positive school culture by clearly defining positive expectations that are taught to all students and adults (Bradshaw, 2014).__________ 6. Teachers should assume that students know the appropriate and expected classroom behaviors. Instead, teachers should make it a priority to help their students understand what appropriate classroom behaviors are and make this information explicit.__________ 7. Make your classroom goals easy to understand and measurable (e.g., if your goal is to "be respectful" make sure your students know what that means. Provide them examples of negative behaviors that you expect from them).__________ 8. Most classroom teachers have trained in functional assessment or analysis of behavior, so it is important that they consult with their colleagues (e.g., school psychologists, special education teachers) who have expertise in this area. __________ 9. Large group instruction can be established for students who need to focus on specific skills to improve and manage their classroom behavior.__________ 10. Research indicates that classroom management systems are effective in managing student behavior and learning because they sustain an orderly learning environment for students, enhance students' academic skills and competencies, and further social and emotional development.​</a>

REGION As you have learned earlier, there are different types of text that you will come across. Some of them are academic and technical, some journalistic in style, and some literary. Some examples of technical texts are scientific reports, studies, and business reports. Journalistic texts include straight news or feature articles, while literary texts include the different literary genres commonly found in literature books like poems, essays, stories, plays, and novels, among others.

Effective classroom management principles work across almost all subject areas and grade levels (Brophy, 2006; Lewis, et al., 2006).__________ 2. Although effective classroom management produces a variety of positive outcomes for students, according to a 2006 survey of pre-K through grade 12 teachers conducted by APA, teachers report a lack of support in implementing classroom management strategies.__________ 3. Chaotic classroom environments are a large issue for teachers and can contribute to high teacher stress and burnout rates.__________ 4. It is important to use effective classroom management strategies at the universal level in a tiered model, as they serve as both prevention and intervention methods that promote positive outcomes for teachers. __________ 5. At the school wide level, teachers and staff create a positive school culture by clearly defining positive expectations that are taught to all students and adults (Bradshaw, 2014).__________ 6. Teachers should assume that students know the appropriate and expected classroom behaviors. Instead, teachers should make it a priority to help their students understand what appropriate classroom behaviors are and make this information explicit.__________ 7. Make your classroom goals easy to understand and measurable (e.g., if your goal is to "be respectful" make sure your students know what that means. Provide them examples of negative behaviors that you expect from them).__________ 8. Most classroom teachers have trained in functional assessment or analysis of behavior, so it is important that they consult with their colleagues (e.g., school psychologists, special education teachers) who have expertise in this area. __________ 9. Large group instruction can be established for students who need to focus on specific skills to improve and manage their classroom behavior.__________ 10. Research indicates that classroom management systems are effective in managing student behavior and learning because they sustain an orderly learning environment for students, enhance students' academic skills and competencies, and further social and emotional development.​</h2><br />

                            30. Lesson 1 ACADEMIC AND LITERARY WRITING What's In What I Need to Know LEARNING OUTCOMES: After going through the process of discovery with the learning tasks, you are expected to: 1. differentiate literary writing from academic writing: 2. classify given text types after examining various examples, and; 3. share significant insights in recognizing kinds of writing. REGION As you have learned earlier, there are different types of text that you will come across. Some of them are academic and technical, some journalistic in style, and some literary. Some examples of technical texts are scientific reports, studies, and business reports. Journalistic texts include straight news or feature articles, while literary texts include the different literary genres commonly found in literature books like poems, essays, stories, plays, and novels, among others.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>However, it is essential to note that academic writing and literary writing are two distinct types of writing.</p><p></p><p>Academic writing is a type of writing that is formal and organized, commonly used in universities, colleges, and scholarly publications. Academic writing focuses on presenting ideas and research in a clear, concise, and logical way, while providing credible sources to support arguments. This type of writing is usually objective, and facts are presented in a way that is free from personal opinions or biases. Examples of academic writing include research papers, theses, dissertations, and academic articles.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, literary writing is a type of writing that is artistic and creative in nature and often explores topics such as human experiences, emotions, and relationships. Literary writing aims to engage readers emotionally and intellectually, using figurative language, imagery, and symbolism to convey meaning. Examples of literary writing include novels, poetry, plays, and essays.</p><p></p><p>Through examining various examples of text types, you will be able to classify them based on their characteristics and understand the difference between academic and literary writing. This will help you recognize the specific purpose and intended audience of different writing styles, therefore improving your overall understanding of various types of writing.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the distinction between academic and literary writing is crucial in developing your writing skills. By being able to differentiate between the two, you can determine the appropriate writing style to use for specific tasks, which can help you meet the expectations of your audiences effectively.</p><p></p><br />
