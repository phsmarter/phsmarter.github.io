                                            Directions: Read the essay below. Underline the expressions of counterclaim that are used in the paragraph below.  The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affects our country. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the disruptions the pandemic has caused. Contrary to the belief of other that this has caused families to become one, many still suffers from mental anxiety despite being with their family. It might be true to some, but not to all specially to young people. According to the KFF analysis of the Household Pulse Survey, throughout the pandemic, a large share of young adults (ages 18-24 have reported symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorder yet many have regarded mental anxiety as whining. However, there are also groups that advocate on being well-aware of everyone’s mental stability. There is an argument that a person’s mental stability depends on the people that surrounds him, or in the environment he is engaged in. Therefore, it cannot be a guarantee, that spending the whole pandemic time with your family can be mentally healthy. In contrast, this can be a source of anxiety when you are not understood and being neglected since they can see you every day.</a>

                            18. Directions: Read the essay below. Underline the expressions of counterclaim that are used in the paragraph below.  The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affects our country. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the disruptions the pandemic has caused. Contrary to the belief of other that this has caused families to become one, many still suffers from mental anxiety despite being with their family. It might be true to some, but not to all specially to young people. According to the KFF analysis of the Household Pulse Survey, throughout the pandemic, a large share of young adults (ages 18-24 have reported symptoms of anxiety and/or depressive disorder yet many have regarded mental anxiety as whining. However, there are also groups that advocate on being well-aware of everyone’s mental stability. There is an argument that a person’s mental stability depends on the people that surrounds him, or in the environment he is engaged in. Therefore, it cannot be a guarantee, that spending the whole pandemic time with your family can be mentally healthy. In contrast, this can be a source of anxiety when you are not understood and being neglected since they can see you every day.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The effects of the COVID-19 panic has caused a massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Life adjustments often come with a wide range of experiences and emotions. Sometimes that transition can feel smooth and other times that journey to the new normal is choppy or downright bumpy as a person, and in our relationships with others. We are attempting to settle into our new routines. For some, this means trying to combat social isolation. For us, it means learning how to live (or re-live) with friends, family members, partners, or roommates, which is not always easy.</p><p>We struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. We feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. We've really had to be very compassionate and patient with ourselves lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting. We are slowly going through the adjustment process and are finding comfort in our new norm. </p><p></p><br />
