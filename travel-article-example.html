In contrast, Rizal was the mother's spoiled favorite son, adored by his many sisters, and served by his father and elder brother Paciano, who opted to work as farmer to support Rizal's vast travels to Europe. 4.

In contrast, Rizal was the mother's spoiled favorite son, adored by his many sisters, and served by his father and elder brother Paciano, who opted to work as farmer to support Rizal's vast travels to Europe. 4. Classrooms nowadays, both in public and private Educational institutions, have computer laboratories for learning. 5. Some schools have television and speakers in most of their classrooms.

The word travelogue supposedly comes from a combination of the two words travel and monologue. ... So, descriptions of a traveler's inner world are not out-of-place in the travelogue.</p><p></p><p>Explanation;</p><p></p><p>In turn, the word monologue comes from the Greek words monos (alone) and logos (speech, word). A travelogue is then, in its most basic form, a spoken or written account of an individual’s experiences traveling, which usually appears in the past tense, in the first person, and with some verisimilitude.</p><p>Because a travelogue aims to be a true account of an individual’s experiences traveling, descriptions of what the traveler sees, hears, tastes, smells, and feels in the external world while traveling are essential components.</p><p>Of course, thoughts, feelings, and reflections are important parts of our experience of travel. So, descriptions of a traveler’s inner world are not out-of-place in the travelogue.</p><p>Likewise, notes and observations on history, society, and culture are also common features of travelogues, as we certainly learn about the world when we travel.</p><p>If you want to write a better travel stories, check out our tips to write better travelogues.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />
