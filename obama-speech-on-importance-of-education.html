                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The theme for President Obama's speech was "Rescue, Rebuild, Restore – a New Foundation for Prosperity". Among the topics that Obama covered in his speech were proposals for job creation and federal deficit reduction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This morning President Obama demonstrated once again — as he did in his Philadelphia speech on race — that speaking candidly about painful, divisive issues can build trust while at the same time edifying and uplifting us all. A single speech is not going to eliminate the anger, feelings of disrespect, and mutual suspicion that have built up over the years between the United States and Muslim communities around the globe, but this was truly a masterful one. It was pitched largely on a moral plane. He elaborated a set of principles to guide not only how the United States and Muslim-majority countries should move forward together, but even the conduct of all nations in an increasingly interdependent world — an unexpected glimpse into his still emerging world view.</p><p></p><p>More critically, the president spoke frankly and openly about issues in our mutual relations that are too often swept under the rug: the Holocaust, the plight of the Palestinians, the use of violence for political ends, the American role in unseating Iran’s democratically elected government in 1953, the education of women, the importance of governments that reflect the will of their people, the right to dress according to religious precepts, etc. He also talked bluntly about America’s responsibilities, and that of other parties, toward resolving the Palestinian-Israeli issue, the nuclear standoff with Iran, and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p></p><p>With his candor, President Obama created the real possibility for what he described as “a new beginning” with the “Muslim world.” It will be up to his Administration in the months and years ahead to flesh out that vision with tangible policies and programs that address the major conflicts and the profound crises of governance confronting many Muslim-majority states. Progress toward finding a final settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will be key. Only time will tell if the United States can pursue policies in this part of the world that live up to it values while at the same time advancing its interests. Regrettably, despite the intense optimism of Obama’s speech, America’s track record in this regard is decidely mixed.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>eto po ba</p><p></p><br />

                            5. what verbal cues are used in Obama's speech for the victims of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everybody.  I’ve just been briefed by my national security team, including FBI Director Mueller, Attorney General Holder, Secretary Napolitano, and my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor Lisa Monaco, on the attacks in Boston.  We continue to mobilize and deploy all appropriate law enforcement resources to protect our citizens, and to investigate and to respond to this attack.</p><p></p><p>Obviously our first thoughts this morning are with the victims, their families, and the city of Boston.  We know that two explosions gravely wounded dozens of Americans, and took the lives of others, including a 8-year-old boy.</p><p></p><p>This was a heinous and cowardly act.  And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism.  Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror.  What we don’t yet know, however, is who carried out this attack, or why; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.  That’s what we don’t yet know.  And clearly, we’re at the beginning of our investigation.</p><p></p><p>It will take time to follow every lead and determine what happened.  But we will find out.  We will find whoever harmed our citizens and we will bring them to justice.</p><p></p><p>We also know this — the American people refuse to be terrorized.  Because what the world saw yesterday in the aftermath of the explosions were stories of heroism and kindness, and generosity and love:  Exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood, and those who stayed to tend to the wounded, some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets.  The first responders who ran into the chaos to save lives.  The men and women who are still treating the wounded at some of the best hospitals in the world, and the medical students who hurried to help, saying “When we heard, we all came in.”  The priests who opened their churches and ministered to the hurt and the fearful.  And the good people of Boston who opened their homes to the victims of this attack and those shaken by it.</p><p></p><p>So if you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil — that’s it.  Selflessly.  Compassionately.  Unafraid.</p><p></p><p>In the coming days, we will pursue every effort to get to the bottom of what happened.  And we will continue to remain vigilant.  I’ve directed my administration to take appropriate security measures to protect the American people.  And this is a good time for all of us to remember that we all have a part to play in alerting authorities — if you see something suspicious, speak up.</p><p></p><p>I have extraordinary confidence in the men and women of the FBI, the Boston Police Department, and the other agencies that responded so heroically and effectively in the aftermath of yesterday’s events.  I’m very grateful for the leadership of Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino.  And I know that even as we protect our people and aggressively pursue this investigation, the people of Boston will continue to respond in the same proud and heroic way that they have thus far — and their fellow Americans will be right there with them.</p><p></p><p>Thank you very much.  And you can expect further briefings from our law enforcement officials as the day goes on.  When we have more details, they will be disclosed.  What I’ve indicated to you is what we know now.  We know it was bombs that were set off.  We know that obviously they did some severe damage.  We do not know who did them.  We do not know whether this was an act of an organization or an individual or individuals.  We don’t have a sense of motive yet.  So everything else at this point is speculation.  But as we receive more information, as the FBI has more information, as our out counterterrorism teams have more information, we will make sure to keep you and the American people posted.</p><p></p><p>Thank you very much, everybody.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Before his presidency, he served in the Illinois Senate (1997–2004) and the United States Senate (2005–2008).
</p><p>
</p><p>It was during his campaign for the United States Senate that he first made a speech that received nationwide attention; he gave the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. and stated "there is not a liberal America and a conservative America—there is the United States of America". Obama began to run for president just three years after that speech. In response to a political controversy involving race during the primary campaign, he delivered his "A More Perfect Union" speech, which was widely seen as a critical point in the campaign.
</p><p>
</p><p>Obama won election to the presidency in 2009 and re-election in 2013. Among the hundreds of speeches he has delivered since then include six speeches before Congress (including four State of the Union addresses), two victory speeches, a speech to the Islamic world in Egypt early in his first term, and a speech following the shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords.

                            11. effects of michelle obama's speech at 2008 democratic convention​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In her first major speech since Barack Obama launched his presidential campaign 20 months ago, she was loudly welcomed by the 4,000-plus delegates at the Democratic convention in Denver waving "Michelle" banners.</p><p></p><p>She went on to speak about Obama as a husband and father who lived his life imbued with American values.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest cheers of the night came when she offered an olive branch to the Clinton camp, praising her for her success in advancing the women's movement. Clinton had "put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher".</p><p></p><p>Michelle Obama lacked the rhetorical ability of her husband and failed to arouse the audience in the way he is capable. The final ovation was loud but not prolonged.</p><p></p><p>The insights into Obama family life were carefully designed to counter jibes from his Republican rival, John McCain, that he is too fond of his newfound celebrity status, that he is elitist and out of touch with working-class Americans.</p><p></p><p>She insisted that in spite of all his success since he launched his White House campaign 19 months ago, "the Barack Obama I know today is the same man I fell in love with 19 years ago".</p><p></p><p>She tried to counter accusations raised by the Republicans about her patriotism after an out-of-context remark she made in January suggesting she had not been proud of the US before Obama won the Iowa caucus that month. In her speech, she pointedly described the US as a "great country" in which everyone had the chance to rise.</p><p></p><p>The loud response when she began the speech eclipsed even that given an hour earlier on a surprise appearance by senator Edward Kennedy, who is suffering from a brain tumour.</p><p></p><p>The four-day convention is scheduled to culminate on Thursday with the formal endorsement of Obama as the first African-American presidential candidate with a serious chance of reaching the White House.</p><p></p><p>Although Obama has been a regular presence on US screens all this year, his life story and politics are still relatively unknown to most Americans.</p><p></p><p>Before Michelle Obama spoke, the convention saw a short video describing her early life in Chicago's South Side and her relationship with Obama, who joked that she had been won over when he bought her an ice cream.</p><p></p><p>She was introduced by her brother Craig, who spoke about their early life together and insisted she would be the first lady. Her mother was also in the audience.</p><p></p><p>She portrayed Obama as having come from humble beginnings and as a patriot who shared American values. He had worked as a community oganiser in Chicago alongside people who believed, "like you and I believe, that America should be a place where you can make it if you try".</p><p></p><p>In one of many sentimental passages, she won a round of applause when she said he had been unchanged by his success and illustrated it with a description of the birth of their first child: "He's the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer, inching along at a snail's pace, peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror, feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands, determined to give her everything he'd struggled so hard for himself, determined to give her what he never had: the affirming embrace of a father's love."</p><p></p><p>After she finished, Obama, who is not due in Denver until Wednesday, joined the convention by video to praise his wife and to invited his children to comment on her speech. "I think she did good," one of them said.</p><p></p><p>The children then waved at the screen saying, "love you, Daddy".</p><p></p><p>As Michelle Obama intervened on behalf of her husband with her first major speech since he began his campaign 20 months ago, Cindy McCain also went into action.</p><p></p><p>John McCain told fundraisers in Sacramento, California, that she is to visit Georgia to assess the humanitarian situation after the conflict with Russia</p><p></p><p>McCain's campaign team sees foreign affairs as their candidate's strong point and believes he was helped by the conflict. Her presence in Georgia will help bring the issue back into the US election campaign.</p><p></p><p>"She is on her way to the little country of Georgia," said John McCain, who criticised Russia's involvement.</p><br />

His wisest tactic was to point his listeners to a new horizon, creating a single new America out of the two racial Americas that had been in existence since the beginning. Rhetorically, he did it by invoking "our founding fathers," "our forebears," and "our founding documents." In a brilliant move, he relegated the extraordinary fact that he is our first African-American President to the background. More important, he suggested, was the reality that he noted early in his speech: He is the 44th American President, who traces the legacy of his power and his Presidency back to America's founding.</p><br />
