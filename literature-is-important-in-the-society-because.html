                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

                            5. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers.

Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.
