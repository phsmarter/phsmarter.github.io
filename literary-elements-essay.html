One of the happiest moments of my childhood was when my parents surprised me with a brand new bicycle on my 10th birthday. The shiny, red bike with silver rims and a bell was everything I had wished for. The moment I laid my eyes on it, my heart leaped with joy, and my face broke into a wide smile. I could feel my cheeks hurting from the excitement, and I couldn't wait to take it out for a ride. As I rode the bike, the wind blowing in my face, I felt a sense of freedom and happiness that I had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the saddest moment of my childhood was when I had to say goodbye to my best friend, who was moving to another city. We had been inseparable since kindergarten, and the thought of not seeing her every day made me feel empty inside. I remember the day she left; I tried to be strong, but as soon as she hugged me, tears started streaming down my face. It felt like a piece of my heart was being ripped away from me. The pain of losing my best friend was overwhelming, and I spent days crying and feeling miserable.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>imagery (visual description of the shiny, red bike with silver rims and a bell, the wind blowing in my face)</p><p>metaphor (a piece of my heart being ripped away)</p><p>hyperbole (my cheeks hurting from smiling too much, the pain of losing my friend was overwhelming)<br /><br />please underline the sentences inside the parenthesis</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The diversity and richness of Philippine literature evolved side by side with the country's history. This can best be appreciated in the context of the country's pre-colonial cultural traditions and the socio-political histories of its colonial and contemporary traditions. The average Filipino's unfamiliarity with his indigenous literature was largely due to what has been impressed upon him: that his country was "discovered" and, hence, Philippine "history" started only in 1521.  So successful were the efforts of colonialists to blot out the memory of the country's largely oral past that present-day Filipino writers, artists and journalists are trying to correct this inequity by recognizing the country's wealth of ethnic traditions and disseminating them in schools and in the mass media.  The rousings of nationalistic pride in the 1960s and 1970s also helped bring about this change of attitude among a new breed of Filipinos concerned about the "Filipino identity."</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        The coronavirus has transformed life as we know it. Schools are closed, we’re confined to our homes and the future feels very uncertain. Why write at a time like this?<br /><br />For one, we are living through history. Future historians may look back on the journals, essays and art that ordinary people are creating now to tell the story of life during the coronavirus.<br /><br />But writing can also be deeply therapeutic. It can be a way to express our fears, hopes and joys. It can help us make sense of the world and our place in it.<br /><br />Plus, even though school buildings are shuttered, that doesn’t mean learning has stopped. Writing can help us reflect on what’s happening in our lives and form new ideas.<br /><br />
