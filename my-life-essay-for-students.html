Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

The feeling is so warm with asweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, thefeeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. Sheteaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raisingme up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I wasyoung because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than aprofessional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for herteaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in theInternet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom dealswith them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this.Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which Ienvy.They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike in the mountains. ___2.Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and more compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future.___3. Though cell phones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating, distracting students by the possibility to access the internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cell phones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon as cyberbullying. ___4. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska. America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old. George and Terry, my two best friends and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.___5. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 ( Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were much higher than today.​</a>

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My area has just become one of the most infected areas of my state. Things are much different than they used to be. I defiantly feel the panic from others as grocery stores sellout of things like toilet paper or bottled water. I feel the panic from our leaders, who have put policy in place to hopefully end this virus in the near future. I think the reaction is appropriate and I appreciate everything that people are doing to help stop the spread, no matter how boring it may be.
</p><p>
</p><p>I can confidently say that my life has indeed changed. I am a senior in high school, and this was not how I was planning to spend my senior year. Every day I wake up and “go” to online school. I do my work and then workout. I eat at the times we normally would eat. My routine is extremely repetitive, and we have only been doing this for a few weeks. I understand that we may have to do this for a long time, and I am fully willing to do so in hopes that we can return to normal soon.
</p><p>
</p><p>I think the biggest challenge for me has been realizing that I might never go to my high school again to thank the teachers who changed my life and finally graduate after waiting four long years. It is hard that I must make a college decision in a time like this, but I also understand that there are many people out there who are not in the same position I am at the moment, so I am grateful for my opportunities and my blessings. However, I do feel that there is good in this situation. I plan on going to college across the country, so I am glad I can spend time with my family before I leave. I believe that the future is uncertain going forward. I always ask myself if things will ever go back to what I consider “normal”. I hope that it will, and I hope that I will get the opportunity to do the things I want to do in my life. I think that there is something to be learned, but I just do not know what it is yet. I hope we can fight this together and come out stronger.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Student life is meant to help us learn discipline and study. Despite that, life is quite enjoyable. The struggle is low in student life. One must get up early in the morning to get ready for school or college. Similarly, rushing to the bus stop is very exciting during student life. The mothers constantly remind us to hurry up and not be late. It is no less than a mantra for all mothers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In addition, there are other exciting moments in student life. We sometimes forget to complete our homework and then pretend to find the notebook when the teacher asks for it. With the examination time around the corner, the fun stops for a while but not long. One of the most exciting things about student life is getting to go on picnics and trips with your friends.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You get to enjoy yourself and have a  lot of fun. Even waiting for the exam result with friends becomes fun. The essence of student life lies in the little things like getting curious about your friend’s marks, getting jealous if they score more, and so on. The excitement for games period or learning about a new teacher. While student life teaches us discipline, it also gives us a lot of fun. It is a memorable time in everyone’s life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Student life is a vital part of everyone’s life. The future of the students and the country depends on how we are as students. Thus, getting the right guidance is essential. Student life builds the foundation for our life. Thus, if your foundation is strong, the building will be a strong one too. However, a weak foundation cannot make a building stand. In other words, student life helps us embrace human qualities.</p><p></p><p></p><p>People don’t realize how lucky and privileged one is to even get a student life. Many children dream of having it but never get one. Thus, if one gets to attain education, one must make the most of it. Student life won’t always be filled with happiness but it will be worthwhile. It helps us grow in the path of life and acquire qualities such as honesty, patience, perseverance, and more.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Student life is one of the most memorable phases of a person's life. The phase of student life builds the foundation of our life. In student life, we do not just learn from books. We learn to grow emotionally, physically, philosophically as well as socially. Student life is the best phase of life which is like a complete roller coaster full of ups and downs . The only thing students are scared are of grades or superiority or being famous that's all. </p><p></p><p></p><p>All in all, student life is no less than perfect. Even though it has many ups and downs, it is all worth it in the end. Our student life determines a lot of things in our lives later on. Therefore, we must strive to be good students not just academically but also in other aspects. It is like a backbone to have a successful life later on.</p><p></p><br />

                            5. Make an Essay (minimum of 200 words) Title: MY LIFE AS A STUDENT DURING PANDEMIC​</h2><br />
                        The effects of the COVID-19 panic has caused a massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly. Life adjustments often come with a wide range of experiences and emotions. Sometimes that transition can feel smooth and other times that journey to the new normal is choppy or downright bumpy!<br /><br />Some people may find themselves in survival mode, gathering information and resources necessary to function at school, work, as a person, and in our relationships with others. Others may be attempting to settle into their new routines. For some, this means trying to combat social isolation. For many, it means learning how to live (or re-live) with friends, family members, partners, or roommates, which is not always easy. I hear a lot of people struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. For myself, I feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. I’ve really had to be very compassionate and patient with myself lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting. Some people (and I hope there are a lot of you out there), have gone through the adjustment process and are finding comfort in your new norm. In all of this, here are a few important things to remember.<br /><br />This situation is both uncertain and temporary! It’s okay not to feel okay. It’s also okay (and encouraged) to seek help and support!<br />Consider this a time to reflect on who you want to be during this time.<br />Focus on what is within your control.<br />It’s good to be informed, and it’s a really good idea to take breaks from conversations, news, and information related to COVID-19.<br />Adjustment is a process that looks differently for most people. This process is not liner or well-defined. Patience and flexibility are really important.<br />Please be respectful of where you are in the process (some self-compassion can go a long way) and also of where others are.<br />It’s okay to be curious about where your friends, family, and others are in their process and to seek to understand their wants and needs at this time. Don’t forget to tell them what you want and need too!<br />Setting a routine can be really helpful! In addition to doing your schoolwork make sure to schedule time for your physical and emotional health, fun, creatively, social connection, and stress relief!<br />It’s okay to set boundaries, even with family members, friends, and professors.<br />I hope that when reading this you are beginning to see that you aren’t alone in the adjustment process. My wish for you is that you have found some peace in the chaos, and learned something about yourself and the world around you.<br /><br />Pa brainliest po pls <br />Thank you sa points <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I am a person who has experienced various obstacles throughout my life. These obstacles have not only helped me grow as an individual, but they have also shaped who I am today. Growing up, I struggled with self-esteem and confidence issues due to being bullied in school. This made me feel insecure and hesitant to express myself around others.

This taught me the value of hard work and perseverance.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these challenges, I also struggled with anxiety and depression. It was difficult for me to talk about my emotions and seek help, but I knew that it was important to take care of my mental health. I found support through therapy, self-care practices, and building strong relationships with friends and family.</p><p></p><p>Despite these obstacles, I have been able to overcome them and achieve many accomplishments. I have earned a degree in my chosen field and have a fulfilling career. I have also developed strong interpersonal skills and am confident in myself and my abilities. </p><p></p><p>Looking back, I am grateful for the obstacles that I have faced as they have made me a stronger and more resilient person. These experiences have taught me to embrace challenges and to use them as opportunities for growth. I know that life will continue to bring obstacles, but I am confident in my ability to overcome them and continue to strive towards my goals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>it's 5 paragraph.</p><p></p><br />

Directions: Read the following excerpts [from essays] carefully. Then, write N if the text is Narrative, D if Descriptive, E if Expository, and P if Persuasive. Write the letter of the correct answer on the space provided before the number.
______11. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains.
______12. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future.
______13. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying.
______14. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN Security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001). Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorist activities are not always favorable.

But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />

I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, thefeeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. Sheteaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raisingme up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I wasyoung because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than aprofessional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for herteaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in theInternet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom dealswith them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this.Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which Ienvy.They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes. My mom isthe dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.Answer the following questions. 1.what did the writer compare her mother with?2.write at least three sentences that described the mother based on the essay.3.Based on the given example,what is descriptive essay?

                        The effects of the COVID-19 panic has caused a massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly. Life adjustments often come with a wide range of experiences and emotions. Sometimes that transition can feel smooth and other times that journey to the new normal is choppy or downright bumpy!<br /><br />Some people may find themselves in survival mode, gathering information and resources necessary to function at school, work, as a person, and in our relationships with others. Others may be attempting to settle into their new routines. For some, this means trying to combat social isolation. For many, it means learning how to live (or re-live) with friends, family members, partners, or roommates, which is not always easy. I hear a lot of people struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. For myself, I feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. I’ve really had to be very compassionate and patient with myself lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting. Some people (and I hope there are a lot of you out there), have gone through the adjustment process and are finding comfort in your new norm. In all of this, here are a few important things to remember.<br /><br />This situation is both uncertain and temporary! It’s okay not to feel okay. It’s also okay (and encouraged) to seek help and support!<br />Consider this a time to reflect on who you want to be during this time.<br />Focus on what is within your control.<br />It’s good to be informed, and it’s a really good idea to take breaks from conversations, news, and information related to COVID-19.<br />Adjustment is a process that looks differently for most people. This process is not liner or well-defined. Patience and flexibility are really important.<br />Please be respectful of where you are in the process (some self-compassion can go a long way) and also of where others are.<br />It’s okay to be curious about where your friends, family, and others are in their process and to seek to understand their wants and needs at this time. Don’t forget to tell them what you want and need too!<br />Setting a routine can be really helpful! In addition to doing your schoolwork make sure to schedule time for your physical and emotional health, fun, creatively, social connection, and stress relief!<br />It’s okay to set boundaries, even with family members, friends, and professors.<br />I hope that when reading this you are beginning to see that you aren’t alone in the adjustment process. My wish for you is that you have found some peace in the chaos, and learned something about yourself and the world<br />

                            28. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.
