She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</a>

This is the most common terminology that describes how Filipinos welcome foreigners or tourists who visit the country. This trait of the Filipinos towards their visitors is undeniably exceptional. Whenever a visitor stays in a Filipino home, there will be a feast or a grand celebration as it is somehow a tradition for us to prepare bountiful Filipino cuisine for guests to have a taste of our culture through food. In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors. To add to that, Filipino families are often more than willing to share not only their meals but their entire home as well. As a matter of fact, Filipinos would usually greet their visitors with the phrase "Feel at home!" to ensure that they are at ease during their stay. For Filipinos, it is a pleasure and the country's honor to accept foreigners as visitors and build genuine relationships and friendships with them. Indeed, this clearly shows that Filipinos are a warm and loving people. They give and share what they have for their guest even it means a little sacrifice on their part. But have they ever wondered and pondered on this question? Are they carrying the Filipinos' hospitality to the extremes? Now, it's your turn!

Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</a>

He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</a>

How Our Cultural, Socio-Economic and Religious Background Have an Impact in Resolving the Covid 19 Pandemic in our Country?
by: Maricel Guevarra Veniegas
 The end is still not insight! Perhaps most of you will agree that the end of this pandemic which we have been battling off with nearly two years was still uncertain. There are many lives lost and victims who are fighting for their lives. Schools were still closed, our economy continued to slow down, and our movements were restricted. For Juan dela Cruz but not with Uncle Sam and other neighboring countries who seem to live back to normal. But why? What are the contributing factors why we can’t go back to our normal lives well in fact other countries can?
Cultural background. As for the latest statistics it was found out that rising cases of Covid 19 is the spread among families. Reported news showed that the virus spread fastly among households and family members. Filipinos are known to have a culture of close family ties. Many extended families whereas parents, married children and sometimes even grandparents are living under one roof. In addition, Filipinos have a culture of having too many celebrations and karaoke will never be absent. With this kind of belief, the spread of viruses is being hastened up. 
Socio-economic background. When strict implementation of quarantine was made many Filipinos resisted clamoring that they will not die with the virus but with famine since their daily needs depend on their livelihood. The Philippines is a developing country almost 75 – 80 percent of its citizens are on the poverty line hence these quarantines will even push them into poverty line. So, by no choice, they continue to earn a living despite the threat of being contaminated with the virus to feed their hungry mouth. Hence, cutting down the number of cases in the country is challenging on the government’s part since Filipinos need to continue earning.
Religious background. Among all the contributing factors presented this might be the least. Though Filipinos were said to be religious, the government successfully implemented minimum health protocols in religious gathering and even halted mass gathering that has something to do with religious tradition like fiesta, baptismal and the like.
To sum it up, the cultural and socio-economic background of the Filipinos have an impact in slowing down the mitigation of the pandemic. The pandemic did not change how we Filipinos live by culture and by our economic status. We continue to live together with our family and earn our living even if it will mean risking and losing our lives against the Covid virus.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer: Children should be supervised when using the Internet.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Living in this modern era where everyone relies solely on the internet is a different thing that we all, should pay attention to. Especially when it is the children who are involved in the usage of it, because not all of the informations that we can gather out from it is reliable. Therefore, children will always need to be supervised when using it, for them also to be guided whether what they are looking for is good and appropriate for their ages.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Children nowadays are very fond of using their cellphones to the extent that they almost forget how to live a life without the usage of it, and when we say that children uses their phones, we would really expect that it is associated with the usage of internet, especially knowing that we are in an era where internet hides in every corner. As we all know, internet offers different services for everyone. In that case, children would really love the idea of using it. As what I have mentioned in my first paragraph that not all of the informations that we can get out from the internet is</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>reliable, what I mean is that, we cannot always rely on the internet even if it is always available for all of us. In connection, parents should be the major supervisor of their children, because they’re with them almost 24/7. They should be responsible enough in guiding their children on how to properly use it, because if they fail to do so, there is a tendency that they would also be involved in the problem that may arise due to inappropriate usage of it by their children.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Internet is essential especially nowadays. It plays a vital role for all of us, on a daily basis. Therefore, all of us should be guided on how to properly use it, most especially the children. Parents, along with their children should work hand in hand to make everything safe when using the internet. Educating your children, teaching them proper discipline and making them aware of the things or with the actions that they would be taking would be a big help in order to ensure that they are using internet, properly and correctly.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>here are my answers;</p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong>	Children should be supervised when using the Internet. </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>Yes, children like me should be supervised by their parents on using the internet. Because nowadays there are tr9lls and people who spread fake news all over the internet. Like for example, parents should limit their kids on using the internet and they should also check what groups they’re joining.. and also checking their conversations with other people because sometimes they could be dangerous and their kids could learn some bad things from it. I agree about them supervising us abut on using the internet because that way, I wont learn some bad things and also I will be safe from knowing all the vulgar things from it.</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong>   Learning online is just as good as learning in a traditional classroom.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>My stand on this is neutral. Sometimes it depends on the student’s privileges, like for example, learning online wont be that hard if the student has a reliable internet, good laptop, or gadgets. However, if the student doesn’t have any of this. They’d struggle and the so called ‘learning in a traditional classroom’ will be the best choice for them. So for me learning online would be just as good as learning in a traditional classroom if I have the computer, internet, and gadgets to do so.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong>  Social Media's Role during the Quarantine Period </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>social media became the source of information during this still ongoing pandemic. It helps when it comes to news, entertainment, and many other things. Because of the quarantine people are only very limited to go out and so , social media became their only source to not feel bored inside their houses. Social media also helps when you need tips about some things for you  and your house. With this it can be said that social media holds a big role for people during the quarantine period.</p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong>  Parents should restrict their children's media exposure.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>Yes, for me, our parents should restrict us about our exposure to the sócíal médía, because it has a health risk according to the sydney morning rehab. it says there that it has a psychological effect or gives mental health risk to children as they can be victims to cyber bullying and grow up with depression due to it. Parents should restrict and tell us children that social media could be bad for us and also we should always try our best to understand them. </p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong>   Picnicking is a perfect way for families to spend time together.	</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>Yes, picknicking is the best way to improve family bonds. Putting up a picnic table with good food in a good location is the best way to relax and chill with your family. Like for example a simple picnic on the park with a family while watching the dog palying is a great experience, plus it will lessen the social media exposure. Children like us wille be exposed more to outdoors activity and we would experience playing outside after a long time with fresh air. So yes picknicking is the best way to spend time together.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning online has become increasingly popular, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many schools to switch to remote learning. While some may argue that traditional classroom learning is superior, there is evidence to suggest that online learning is just as effective as traditional learning. Online learning offers greater flexibility, allowing students to learn at their own pace and schedule. Additionally, online learning provides access to a wide range of resources and tools that may not be available in a traditional classroom setting. With the right support and resources, online learning can be just as good as learning in a traditional classroom.</p><br />

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</h2><br />

This is the most common terminology that describes how Filipinos welcome foreigners or tourists who visit the country. This trait of the Filipinos towards their visitors is undeniably exceptional. Whenever a visitor stays in a Filipino home, there will be a feast or a grand celebration as it is somehow a tradition for us to prepare bountiful Filipino cuisine for guests to have a taste of our culture through food. In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors. To add to that, Filipino families are often more than willing to share not only their meals but their entire home as well. As a matter of fact, Filipinos would usually greet their visitors with the phrase "Feel at home!" to ensure that they are at ease during their stay. For Filipinos, it is a pleasure and the country's honor to accept foreigners as visitors and build genuine relationships and friendships with them. Indeed, this clearly shows that Filipinos are a warm and loving people. They give and share what they have for their guest even it means a little sacrifice on their part. But have they ever wondered and pondered on this question? Are they carrying the Filipinos' hospitality to the extremes? Now, it's your turn!

                        <p><strong>Answer:Children should be supervised when using the Internet.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Living in this modern era where everyone relies solely on the internet is a different thing that we all, should pay attention to. Especially when it is the children who are involved in the usage of it, because not all of the informations that we can gather out from it is reliable. Therefore, children will always need to be supervised when using it, for them also to be guided whether what they are looking for is good and appropriate for their ages.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Children nowadays are very fond of using their cellphones to the extent that they almost forget how to live a life without the usage of it, and when we say that children uses their phones, we would really expect that it is associated with the usage of internet, especially knowing that we are in an era where internet hides in every corner. As we all know, internet offers different services for everyone. In that case, children would really love the idea of using it. As what I have mentioned in my first paragraph that not all of the informations that we can get out from the internet is reliable, what I mean is that, we cannot always rely on the internet even if it is always available for all of us. In connection, parents should be the major supervisor of their children, because they’re with them almost 24/7. They should be responsible enough in guiding their children on how to properly use it, because if they fail to do so, there is a tendency that they would also be involved in the problem that may arise due to inappropriate usage of it by their children.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Internet is essential especially nowadays. It plays a vital role for all of us, on a daily basis. Therefore, all of us should be guided on how to properly use it, most especially the children. Parents, along with their children should work hand in hand to make everything safe when using the internet. Educating your children, teaching them proper discipline and making them aware of the things or with the actions that they would be taking would be a big help in order to ensure that they are using internet, properly and correctly.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Title: Children Should Be Supervised When Using the Internet</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>In today's digital age, the Internet has become an integral part of children's lives, providing them with access to a vast array of information and opportunities for interaction. However, with this increased connectivity comes potential risks and dangers. This essay argues that children should be supervised when using the Internet to ensure their safety, protect their well-being, and promote responsible online behavior.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph:</p><p>One of the primary reasons why children should be supervised while using the Internet is to safeguard their safety. The online world is replete with various threats, such as cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and online predators. By providing supervision, parents and guardians can actively monitor their children's online activities, identify potential risks, and take necessary steps to mitigate them. Moreover, supervising children's Internet usage allows for open communication, creating a safe space for discussing any concerns or incidents they may encounter online. Through guidance and supervision, parents can teach children about digital literacy, responsible online behavior, and the importance of protecting their personal information.</p><p></p><p>Another significant aspect of supervising children's Internet usage is ensuring their well-being. Excessive screen time and unrestricted access to the Internet can lead to detrimental effects on children's physical and mental health. By setting boundaries and monitoring their online activities, parents can encourage a healthy balance between digital engagement and other activities, such as physical exercise, social interaction, and creative pursuits. Additionally, supervision allows parents to identify signs of internet addiction or any negative impacts on their children's well-being promptly. With proper supervision, children can develop healthy habits and maintain a positive relationship with technology.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, supervising children's Internet usage is vital in today's digital era. By providing guidance, setting boundaries, and actively monitoring their online activities, parents can ensure their children's safety, protect their well-being, and promote responsible online behavior. Effective supervision empowers children to navigate the online world confidently and equips them with the skills needed to make informed decisions while engaging with digital platforms.</p><br />

                            22. What are the 3 claims in ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY ON CYBERBULLYING.
Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</h2><br />

                            23. "The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

How Our Cultural, Socio-Economic and Religious Background Have an Impact in Resolving the Covid 19 Pandemic in our Country?
by: Maricel Guevarra Veniegas
 The end is still not insight! Perhaps most of you will agree that the end of this pandemic which we have been battling off with nearly two years was still uncertain. There are many lives lost and victims who are fighting for their lives. Schools were still closed, our economy continued to slow down, and our movements were restricted. For Juan dela Cruz but not with Uncle Sam and other neighboring countries who seem to live back to normal. But why? What are the contributing factors why we can’t go back to our normal lives well in fact other countries can?
Cultural background. As for the latest statistics it was found out that rising cases of Covid 19 is the spread among families. Reported news showed that the virus spread fastly among households and family members. Filipinos are known to have a culture of close family ties. Many extended families whereas parents, married children and sometimes even grandparents are living under one roof. In addition, Filipinos have a culture of having too many celebrations and karaoke will never be absent. With this kind of belief, the spread of viruses is being hastened up. 
Socio-economic background. When strict implementation of quarantine was made many Filipinos resisted clamoring that they will not die with the virus but with famine since their daily needs depend on their livelihood. The Philippines is a developing country almost 75 – 80 percent of its citizens are on the poverty line hence these quarantines will even push them into poverty line. So, by no choice, they continue to earn a living despite the threat of being contaminated with the virus to feed their hungry mouth. Hence, cutting down the number of cases in the country is challenging on the government’s part since Filipinos need to continue earning.
Religious background. Among all the contributing factors presented this might be the least. Though Filipinos were said to be religious, the government successfully implemented minimum health protocols in religious gathering and even halted mass gathering that has something to do with religious tradition like fiesta, baptismal and the like.
To sum it up, the cultural and socio-economic background of the Filipinos have an impact in slowing down the mitigation of the pandemic. The pandemic did not change how we Filipinos live by culture and by our economic status. We continue to live together with our family and earn our living even if it will mean risking and losing our lives against the Covid virus.</h2><br />
