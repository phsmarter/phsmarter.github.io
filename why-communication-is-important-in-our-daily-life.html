                                            The Glitch By Divina P. Maming Dela Cruz family came together for breakfast. Each had his/her own story to tell about his/her experiences for the week. This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores. "Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1. What are the different communication scenarios in the story? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 2. How did each communication scenario develop? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 3. Did a conflict arise in the story? What kind of conflict is it? Did it affect the communication process? Was it resolved? How? How did the rest of the family members react to it? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 4. How can we establish a good communication? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 5. What is the importance of communication in our daily life?</a>

Dela Cruz family came together for

“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and

nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged

                                            The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on. Question :How are you going to differentiate arts from nature. 2.State your reason why art is man-made. 3.How is art related to humanities? ​</a>

                                            VIRTUES AMIDST THE PANDEMIC"At the end of the day, all we need is hope and faith."The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been a tragedy for our community and country. With so many parts of our lives that turned upside down, we have to adapt to the "new normal" as our new reality. Despite the uncertainties associated with this crisis, we have seen communities around the world generating hope. Hope provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind, even in tragic situations. To have hope, it is important that we feel a sense of meaning in our lives.In the recent months, we have learned to appreciate two things that give our life meaning - work and connection with friends and family. This pandemic has caused anxieties, fear, and uncertainties. Raising community awareness of mental health issues helps promote a more positive and proactive approach to addressing mental illnesses in this time of pandemic. However, we are capable to be courageous, hopeful, and resilient as we pray for healing around the world.COVID-19 can be considered a blessing in disguise as we look on the brighter side. Because of this global health crisis, we have also learned to value simple things in life. All have been required to stay at home and be with the family. Everyone has started to help each other; family ties have been strengthened. Busy streets and some malls were closed. As a result, pollution was lessened and Mother Earth started to recuperate. We have also realized the importance of hygiene and safety health protocols. The usual daily routine at home and workplace has been changed. Most importantly, we have brought ourselves back again to the Lord and regained our spiritual attachment with Him. This is an awakening call for us to never give up and to see hope in the middle of challenges.Respond to the editorial text on "Virtues Amidst the Pandemic" on page 4 by answering the following questions.

                            6. The Glitch By Divina P. Maming Dela Cruz family came together for breakfast. Each had his/her own story to tell about his/her experiences for the week. This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores. "Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1. What are the different communication scenarios in the story? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 2. How did each communication scenario develop? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 3.

                            13. The Glitch
By Divina P. Maming
Dela Cruz family came together for
breakfast. Each had his/her own
story to tell about his/her
experiences for the week. This is the
usual scenario every Sunday
morning.
“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and
Maria could not wait to reach for
their chairs with a big grin on their
faces as they said, “Good morning,
nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged
his shoulders for disappointment.
“Let’s eat!” mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody
seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they
saw him in a really low spirit. “What happened?” at last, the wife asked.
“I may lose my job,” he said with a croaky voice.
“But why?” Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked
towards him and patted his shoulder. “It’s okay. You can still find another job,” she
said offering him a seat.
The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, “Tatay,
don’t worry, we are here to help.”

                            15. The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on.

Many of today’s most important advancements in medicine, materials, energy, security, climatology, and dozens of other sciences emanate from the wellspring of basic research and development in nuclear physics. Answers to some of the most important questions facing our planet will come from nuclear science, interdisciplinary efforts in energy and climate, and marketplace innovations. The economic impact of the applications of nuclear physics is significant. As an example, particle beams from accelerators are used to process, treat or inspect a wide range of products with a collective value of more than $500 billion.1 At the same time, approximately 23 million nuclear medicine procedures are carried out each year in the United States to diagnose and treat cancers, cardiovascular disease, and certain neurological disorders.

With so many parts of our lives that turned upside down, we have to adapt to the "new normal" as our new reality. Despite the uncertainties associated with this crisis, we have seen communities around the world generating hope. Hope provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind, even in tragic situations. To have hope, it is important that we feel a sense of meaning in our lives.In the recent months, we have learned to appreciate two things that give our life meaning - work and connection with friends and family. This pandemic has caused anxieties, fear, and uncertainties. Raising community awareness of mental health issues helps promote a more positive and proactive approach to addressing mental illnesses in this time of pandemic. However, we are capable to be courageous, hopeful, and resilient as we pray for healing around the world.COVID-19 can be considered a blessing in disguise as we look on the brighter side. Because of this global health crisis, we have also learned to value simple things in life. All have been required to stay at home and be with the family. Everyone has started to help each other; family ties have been strengthened. Busy streets and some malls were closed. As a result, pollution was lessened and Mother Earth started to recuperate. We have also realized the importance of hygiene and safety health protocols. The usual daily routine at home and workplace has been changed. Most importantly, we have brought ourselves back again to the Lord and regained our spiritual attachment with Him. This is an awakening call for us to never give up and to see hope in the middle of challenges.Respond to the editorial text on "Virtues Amidst the Pandemic" on page 4 by answering the following questions. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.1. What virtue provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind in tragicsituations?2.

                            23. why it is important to know friction and gravity in our daily life interactions in our life wether in community or inside our home?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Friction and gravity are important to know in our daily life interactions because they help us understand how things work and how to interact with our environment. For example, friction is what helps us walk on the ground and keeps us from slipping. Gravity is what makes things fall down and is what keeps us from floating off into space.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
