It has mountains, valleys, and fields rich with crops and minerals. It has rivers, waterfalls, and seas abundant in fish and precious sea products. It abounds in enchanting beaches, caves, and tourists' spots. It is no wonder that the Philippines is called the "Pearl of the Orient Seas." 12. The apple orchard was beautiful on the spring morning. Tiny white blossoms dotted the trees. The green grass sparkled with dew. Mist drifted against the faraway mountains. 13. Heavy rains can become a big problem for streams, Pollutants and soil are carried into streams. This can harm fish and other living creatures. But this can be solved by planting trees and bushes along streams. They protect the water in the stream from pollution14. There are six steps to follow to help you effectively prepare for your speech. First, select your topic and core message. Second, create a structure for your speech. Third, write the speech.

It is because of lack of physical activity in large segments of the population. In addition to healthier healthy habits, one solution would be to exercise in a daily basis. 16. During their time, Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio did good things for the Filipinos and for our country. Our heroes were once children like you. When Andres was a little boy, his parents did so he took care of his younger brothers and sisters. As a little boy, Jose Rizal used his time wisely by writing poems, stories, and playlets. 17. We had a great time on the raft ndel The ride begins with a walk up a double flight of stairs. Then, riders wait until a raft comes up the conveyor belt. A lifeguard helps people onto the raft, Once the green light comes on, all it takes is push to get the raft sliding into the deep, dark tunnel. After sliding through a few twists and turns, the raft emerges back into the light and riders find themselves in a small pool - and ready to go again! 18. Dogs are often called as man's best friend. The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with best friendships, was fomed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. People are of great value to dogs too. Dogs that live with people usually have easier access to food and safer place to stay than they would their own, and that truly is what friends are for. 19. Writing names in a smooth bark can harm a tree. Diseases can attack the tree through the cuts in the bark. Trees can die because of these diseases. 20. Many children in the city go to school. They ride buses or jeepneys. Some ride in cars or taxis. Along the way, children see many people. They see many houses and tall buildings. They sometimes feel uncomfortable because of the warm weather. They hear the loud sounds of the vehicles around. Ohl How noisy it is in the big city!​</a>

Lumnay thought of Awiyao as the Awiyao she had known long ago-- a strong,muscular boy carrying his heavy loads of fuel logs down the mountains to his home. She had met him one dayas she was on her way to fill her clay jars with water. He had stopped at the spring to drink and rest; and she hadmade him drink the cool mountain water from her coconut shell. After that it did not take him long to decide tothrow his spear on the stairs of her father's house in token on his desire to marry her.SOMEONE PLS ANSWER THIS CORRECTLY IT'S 20 PNTS MY SISTER NEEDS THE ANSWER ASAP.

Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</a>

                            11.  Activity 2. A Powerful Story “From Where I Stand” (A Gender Equality Project For the Global Goals)Directions: Read a story below. Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</h2><br />
