                        The poem "The Truly Great", a treatise on greatness, is
written by Stephen Spender. This poem, broadly, is an attempt to describe what
makes a person "truly" great. The poem was written in the 1930's
during wartime, this no doubt influenced the poet. However, soldiers are not
the only people he is referring to. He is essentially referring to anyone who
selflessly fights for what they believe in.
Great people has true greatness and passion even before birth, these men are
filled with passion and love. These people who are considered great can bring
change to the world they are living in. And this change is their legacy.

                            8. if you were to leave behind a legacy in this world what would it be brainly</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Support the People and Causes That are Important to You</p><p>My best friend of decades ago once asked me what I thought was the most important attribute of friendship. I replied that support was the major theme of friendship. There isn't any more wonderful feeling in life than making the choice to sustain loyalty to a friend by lovingly supporting everything that is good and right about that person's life. My friend was an advocate of a few major causes in the city we resided in and I supported those causes, too, as she supported mine. Although we parted ways when I moved out of the city, she would always reach out to me and remember my work, my life and my family.</p><p></p><p>2. Reflect and Decide What is Most Important in Your Life</p><p>When you review your life's journey, several ideas may come to mind: Did you grow and perhaps transform your life, make changes when you needed to, find your truth, inspire others, become a leader or influence others? Touching lives and exemplifying a truthful path is paramount to living a joyful and purposeful life. Your legacy will live on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. Share Your Blessings With Others</p><p>I was walking two dogs the other day -- one dog was totally blind and the other dog stubbornly knew her mind. I stopped suddenly in the middle of my son's beautiful neighborhood to observe with wonder the late afternoon thunderclouds bulging out from the mountains. I thought of all the blessings I have in life and how I try to be mindful of sharing with others the richness of my life. I have been given abundance and such is my fate. And it is my legacy to give back this abundance to others. Everyone has blessings to share, even if it a simple smile of acknowledgement.</p><p></p><p>4. Be a Mentor to Others</p><p>A mentor by definition is a more experienced or more knowledgeable person with an area of expertise. Everyone has some significant truth to impart to others that will guide less experienced people in life. The mentoring/mentee relationship involves personal development and support. This process involves an exchange of knowledge complimented by psychological and/or social support that is crucial to sustaining new mindsets. Sometimes these relationships last a lifetime, even when the mentee has moved on to influence others.</p><p></p><p>5. Pursue Your Passions Because They Are Infectious</p><p>Your passions are your legacy. Passion comes from an outpouring of the interests and ideas that make a difference in your life. Finding and pursing your passion allows you to see your destiny clearly. That's what happened to me with yoga and dancing tango. I can attest to the fact that life won't be any fun if you don't pursue your passions to the fullest. It's contagious. It's religious. It's religious. Don't miss the opportunity to pursue your passions and then continue to look for new adventures.</p><br />

        This poem, broadly, is an attempt to describe what makes a
person "truly" great. The poem was written in the 1930's during
wartime, this no doubt influenced the poet. However, soldiers are not the only
people he is referring to. He is essentially referring to anyone who selflessly
fights for what they believe in. The legacy which the truly great person can
leave is change in the world they are living in.

                            22. if you were to leave behind a legacy in this world what would it be</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Support the People and Causes That are Important to You</p><p>My best friend of decades ago once asked me what I thought was the most important attribute of friendship. I replied that support was the major theme of friendship. There isn't any more wonderful feeling in life than making the choice to sustain loyalty to a friend by lovingly supporting everything that is good and right about that person's life. My friend was an advocate of a few major causes in the city we resided in and I supported those causes, too, as she supported mine. Although we parted ways when I moved out of the city, she would always reach out to me and remember my work, my life and my family.</p><p></p><p>2. Reflect and Decide What is Most Important in Your Life</p><p>When you review your life's journey, several ideas may come to mind: Did you grow and perhaps transform your life, make changes when you needed to, find your truth, inspire others, become a leader or influence others? Touching lives and exemplifying a truthful path is paramount to living a joyful and purposeful life. Your legacy will live on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. Share Your Blessings With Others</p><p>I was walking two dogs the other day -- one dog was totally blind and the other dog stubbornly knew her mind. I stopped suddenly in the middle of my son's beautiful neighborhood to observe with wonder the late afternoon thunderclouds bulging out from the mountains. I thought of all the blessings I have in life and how I try to be mindful of sharing with others the richness of my life. I have been given abundance and such is my fate. And it is my legacy to give back this abundance to others. Everyone has blessings to share, even if it a simple smile of acknowledgement.</p><p></p><p>4. Be a Mentor to Others</p><p>A mentor by definition is a more experienced or more knowledgeable person with an area of expertise. Everyone has some significant truth to impart to others that will guide less experienced people in life. The mentoring/mentee relationship involves personal development and support. This process involves an exchange of knowledge complimented by psychological and/or social support that is crucial to sustaining new mindsets. Sometimes these relationships last a lifetime, even when the mentee has moved on to influence others.</p><p></p><p>5. Pursue Your Passions Because They Are Infectious</p><p>Your passions are your legacy. Passion comes from an outpouring of the interests and ideas that make a difference in your life. Finding and pursing your passion allows you to see your destiny clearly. That's what happened to me with yoga and dancing tango. I can attest to the fact that life won't be any fun if you don't pursue your passions to the fullest. It's contagious. It's religious. It's religious. Don't miss the opportunity to pursue your passions and then continue to look for new adventures.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>What legacy do great people leave behind them?
<p>
</p><p>Generally, <strong>great people</strong> leave behind hope and inspiration to those they have touched.
</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What makes a<strong> great</strong> person, depends on who you ask, but here are some general questions we subconsciously have in our minds when we looking at a potential candidate for greatness.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Questions we ask ourselves:
</strong></p>What does this person stand for?
What are his principles?
What has he done?
What can he do for us?
How does he or she treat other people?
<p>
</p><p>Those questions above are what we use to gauge someone to determine greatness, they would have to represent us in a way, we have to see a similarity between that individual and ourselves. In a way, this person would have to be able to do what we couldn’t do ourselves for whatever reason.  
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>A great person would have to be:
</strong></p>Inspiring
Charismatic
Good
Brave
<p>
</p><p>This is where our biases enter the scene, we are all driven by our individual personalities,  therefore, we are stimulated by different qualities, and attitudes when faced with another person. We tend to look towards those who are similar to us, this is why different groups support very different goals, and agendas.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Here are some examples of known people in recent history with a wide following:
</strong></p>Ferdinand Marcos
Benigno Aquino Jr.
Adolf Hitler
Jose Rizal
Andres Bonifacio
Donald Trump
<p>
</p><p>From those people mentioned above, we can see just from the first two names, the late Ferdinand Marcos and Benigno Aquino Jr. have supporters that think very differently. Both sides think the other one is a political villain and their man is a <strong>great</strong> hero. Those who have an authoritarian mindset would take the side of the strongman Marcos and those who value liberal ideas and individual freedom would certainly be on Aquino’s side.  </p><p>
</p><p>Those who like authoritarianism would also favor men like the present US President Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler who seem to have a very similar type of loyalist. They want their leaders to be strong, forceful and a penchant for speaking about racial supremacy.  </p><p>
</p><p>The argument on whether Jose Rizal or Andres Bonifacio should be the national hero resurfaces from time to time. Those who value academic excellence would often take Rizal’s side, arguing that violence solves nothing. Those on Bonifacio’s side would be heard asking “what did writing books ever do to free the country?”.  </p><p>
</p><p>So just from those examples, we can see that the opinion about a person’s greatness is subjective, we all have different views and it will always stay that way. Good or bad, a person’s legacy will always depend on those who admire them, those they have given hope to, inspired, and touched, to them they are <strong>great.  </strong></p><p>

based on the 2nd stanza, what should not be forgotten?
What legacy do great people leave behind them?</h2><br />
                        The Truly Great by Stephen Spender<p>The poem begins seeming like a praise to incredible individuals ever. As the main stanza grows, be that as it may, the speaker is by all accounts saying all the more regarding how significance is conceived of the association among ages and the association among humankind and nature.  </p><p>
The incredible ones recall the spirit's history, which means they comprehend the past. They have a noteworthy, possibly otherworldly, association with mankind's history and world history. The "interminable and singing" "halls of light" speak to the unending edification that is constantly accessible for human potential. The vitality of the world and the universe goes through that significance. Everything is associated.</p><p></p>Second stanza<p>The speaker laces thoughts of human life and the regular world. This proposes an inalienable association. There is something natural or harmonious about this. Note that in this stanza, the speaker cautions:</p><p></p>Never to allow gradually the traffic to smother
With noise and fog the flowering of the spirit.<p></p><p>The speaker is recommending that "traffic" (mechanical commotion and diversion) can upset the human/nature association. High-roller utilizes the "blossoming of the soul" representation to underscore this association between nature ("bloom") and the human "soul."  </p>  Last Stanza<p>The speaker exemplifies parts of nature, guaranteeing that they acclaim (fete) the incredible ones ever. In the last two lines, the speaker closes by portraying how the impact of extraordinary individuals is left in the "clear air." Their impact can be seen and recalled in human culture. High-roller closes with another idea of nature ("air"). It's as though to state their impact isn't just written in books, yet in addition in the common air itself.  </p><p>
</p><p>People are of the earth. Their vitality originates from the Sun. In this way, their significance is actually and idyllically connected to nature. Association is a significant subject here. The best ones recall the spirit's past. High-roller is demonstrating how they are associated with others crosswise over time and how they are associated with nature itself. It is an idealistic and cheerful sonnet since it is about human potential just as recorded, environmental, and profound association.</p><p></p><p>To know more about the poem:</p>https://brainly.ph/question/193056
