                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A growing research literature suggests that regular electronic game play and game-based training programs may confer practically significant benefits to cognitive functioning. Most evidence supporting this idea, the gaming-enhancement hypothesis, has been collected in small-scale studies of university students and older adults. This research investigated the hypothesis in a general way with a large sample of 1,847 school-aged children. Our aim was to examine the relations between young people’s gaming experiences and an objective test of reasoning performance. Using a Bayesian hypothesis testing approach, evidence for the gaming-enhancement and null hypotheses were compared.</strong></p><br />

The hypothesis also proposes a possible explanation for this relationship, namely that online games may be distracting and negatively impact time management skills, which in turn affects a student's ability to participate actively in class.</p><p></p><p>To test this hypothesis, researchers could conduct a study that compares the academic performance and class participation of students who play online games regularly with those who do not. The study could also include additional variables, such as the amount of time spent playing online games, to further explore the relationship between online gaming and academic performance.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Because the children or students playing online games will get addicted more, they have a chance to not participate in class participation or they will feel lazy because in their head, they want to play online games. And most of students played online games so they have no time to review or to study, that's when their head becoming slow when comes in academics. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>PA</strong><strong> </strong><strong>BRAINLIEST</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>gawa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po</strong><strong> </strong><strong>yan</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hypoteses ay isang iminungkahing paliwanag para sa isang kababalaghan. Para sa isang teorya na maging isang pang-agham na teorya, kinakailangan ng pamamaraang pang-agham na masubukan ito ng isa. Karaniwang binabatay ng mga siyentista ang mga pang-agham na hipotesis sa mga nakaraang obserbasyon na hindi kasiya-siyang maipaliwanag sa mga magagamit na teoryang pang-agham. Kahit na ang mga salitang "teorya" at "teorya" ay madalas na ginagamit nang magkasingkahulugan. Ang isang gumaganang teorya ay isang pansamantalang tinanggap na teorya na iminungkahi para sa karagdagang pananaliksik,  sa isang proseso na nagsisimula sa isang edukadong hula o kaisipan. </p><br />
