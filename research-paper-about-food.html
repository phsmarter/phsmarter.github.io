                                            Studying methods of monitoring pests                     and crops       Chapter 1     Introduction     The study of pest monitoring and crops is essential to ensuring the successful growth and yield of crops. The advancement of technology and scientific research has led to the development of various Study Methods for understanding pest behavior and crop growth. Through inquiries, investigations, and immersion, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the various factors affecting crop production and the management of Pest. In this paper, we will examine the various methods of study used in monitoring pests and crops and how they contribute to the development of sustainable agricultural practices.           Statement of the problem       The state of the problem in this study   Revolves around the need to explore   And understand effective methods of   Monitoring pests and crops within the   Context of inquiries, investigations, and   Immersion. This research aims to address   The following questions and concerns:       What are the current methods of   Monitoring pests and crops in the field of   Inquiries, investigations, and immersion?       What are the limitations or challenges   Associated with existing monitoring   Methods?       Are there innovative and alternative   Approaches that can enhance the   Monitoring of pests and crops during   Inquiries, investigations, and immersion?       How can the integration of technology   And data analysis contribute to more   Efficient and accurate monitoring   Processes?       What are the potential implications and   Benefits of adopting improved monitoring   Methods for pest management and crop   Productivity?       By examining these inquiries and   Conducting thorough investigations and   Immersions, this study aims to contribute   To the development and enhancement   Of monitoring methods in the field of   Pest management and crop cultivation.   The findings of this research will provide   Valuable insights and recommendations   For practitioners, researchers, and   Policymakers to improve monitoring   Practices and ultimately enhance   Agricultural productivity and sustainability.     Significance of the study     The significance of studying methods of monitoring pests and crops through inquiries, investigations, and immersion can be described as follows: Improving Crop Yields: By studying different methods of monitoring pests and crops, farmers can develop effective strategies to control pests and diseases, resulting in improved crop yields. This can help meet the increasing demand for food production, especially in areas with limited arable land. Reducing Environmental Impact: Traditional methods of pest control, such as chemical pesticides, can have adverse effects on the environment. Studying alternative methods such as biological control or integrated pest management can help reduce the environmental impact of pest control and promote sustainable agriculture. Enhancing Farmer Knowledge: By immersing themselves in the field and investigating different methods of pest control and crop monitoring, farmers can enhance their knowledge and skills. This can lead to better decision-making, more effective pest control, and higher crop yields. Contributing to Scientific Knowledge: Studying methods of monitoring pests and crops through inquiries, investigations, and immersion can contribute to the body of scientific knowledge on agriculture. This can help inform future research and development in the field, ultimately leading to more effective pest control and sustainable agriculture practices.     INQUIRIES:       What are the common pests that affect crops in our area, and how can they be identified?           How do farmers currently monitor pest infestations in their crops?       What are the common methods of crops monitoring used in agriculture?   INVESTIGATIONS:       Investigate the effectiveness of different crop monitoring techniques for pest control.   Analyze the impact of climate change on pest infestations in crops.       Conduct a study on the economic benefits of crops monitoring and pest control for small – scale farmers.       IMMERSION:   Participate in a farm where crop monitoring techniques are implemented and observe the different methods used.   Visit an agricultural research center and learn about the latest technologies and research on pest and crop monitoring.Volunteer in a community program that promotes sustainable agriculture, and learn about their methods of monitoring pests and crops.

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                                            PRE-ACTIVITY 6.2: INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT EVOLUTION
(Write your answer on a pad paper)
1. Some snakes have hipbones, which shows they once had four legs like lizards, their close
cousins.
2. Birds evolved from dinosaurs and both are descended from reptiles. The closest living
reptilian relation of a bird is the crocodile.
3.
Most people had brown eyes until about 10,000 years ago when a single genetic mutation
from the Black Sea switched the eyes from brown to blue. Approximately 8% of the world's
population now has blue eyes.
Darwin did not argue that humans came from monkeys. Rather he wrote only that
monkeys, apes, and humans have a common ancestor.
4.
5. Researchers suggest that the discovery of fire influenced human evolution. Fire allowed
humans to cook their food, which made food easier to chew and digest-which, in turn,
contributed to the reduction of human tooth and gut size.
Key Questions:
1. Which fun fact for you is the most interesting? Why do you say so?
2. Which fun fact is already familiar or you already know?
3. The term "evolve or evolution" has been used in many animated series on TV and online,

                                            2. Objective In general, academic writing is based on facts and evidence and is not affected by personal emotions. Therefore, to make your essay or research paper convincing, you must use an unbiased style of writing. To maintain an objective tone in your writing, avoid the following: a. personal statement and judgement X I performed an experiment. I believe that fast food contributes to obesity. The experiment was performed. this paper, the effects of fast food consumption on obesity were presented in various studies. In writing a research report, for you to avoid personal pronoun like 'I', use the passive voice. Avoid phrases like 'I believe", "I think", or "I feel" because it may indicate bias. DIVCT b. emotional language X It is unfortunate that many Filipinos do not have work these days. Based on the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data, about half or 48.2% of unemployed Filipinos are from ages 18-24. Instead of emotional language, include facts or evidence to prove your point.​</a>

                            8. Studying methods of monitoring pests                     and crops       Chapter 1     Introduction     The study of pest monitoring and crops is essential to ensuring the successful growth and yield of crops. The advancement of technology and scientific research has led to the development of various Study Methods for understanding pest behavior and crop growth. Through inquiries, investigations, and immersion, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the various factors affecting crop production and the management of Pest. In this paper, we will examine the various methods of study used in monitoring pests and crops and how they contribute to the development of sustainable agricultural practices.           Statement of the problem       The state of the problem in this study   Revolves around the need to explore   And understand effective methods of   Monitoring pests and crops within the   Context of inquiries, investigations, and   Immersion. This research aims to address   The following questions and concerns:       What are the current methods of   Monitoring pests and crops in the field of   Inquiries, investigations, and immersion?       What are the limitations or challenges   Associated with existing monitoring   Methods?       Are there innovative and alternative   Approaches that can enhance the   Monitoring of pests and crops during   Inquiries, investigations, and immersion?       How can the integration of technology   And data analysis contribute to more   Efficient and accurate monitoring   Processes?       What are the potential implications and   Benefits of adopting improved monitoring   Methods for pest management and crop   Productivity?       By examining these inquiries and   Conducting thorough investigations and   Immersions, this study aims to contribute   To the development and enhancement   Of monitoring methods in the field of   Pest management and crop cultivation.   The findings of this research will provide   Valuable insights and recommendations   For practitioners, researchers, and   Policymakers to improve monitoring   Practices and ultimately enhance   Agricultural productivity and sustainability.     Significance of the study     The significance of studying methods of monitoring pests and crops through inquiries, investigations, and immersion can be described as follows: Improving Crop Yields: By studying different methods of monitoring pests and crops, farmers can develop effective strategies to control pests and diseases, resulting in improved crop yields. This can help meet the increasing demand for food production, especially in areas with limited arable land. Reducing Environmental Impact: Traditional methods of pest control, such as chemical pesticides, can have adverse effects on the environment. Studying alternative methods such as biological control or integrated pest management can help reduce the environmental impact of pest control and promote sustainable agriculture. Enhancing Farmer Knowledge: By immersing themselves in the field and investigating different methods of pest control and crop monitoring, farmers can enhance their knowledge and skills. This can lead to better decision-making, more effective pest control, and higher crop yields. Contributing to Scientific Knowledge: Studying methods of monitoring pests and crops through inquiries, investigations, and immersion can contribute to the body of scientific knowledge on agriculture. This can help inform future research and development in the field, ultimately leading to more effective pest control and sustainable agriculture practices.     INQUIRIES:       What are the common pests that affect crops in our area, and how can they be identified?           How do farmers currently monitor pest infestations in their crops?       What are the common methods of crops monitoring used in agriculture?   INVESTIGATIONS:       Investigate the effectiveness of different crop monitoring techniques for pest control.   Analyze the impact of climate change on pest infestations in crops.       Conduct a study on the economic benefits of crops monitoring and pest control for small – scale farmers.       IMMERSION:   Participate in a farm where crop monitoring techniques are implemented and observe the different methods used.   Visit an agricultural research center and learn about the latest technologies and research on pest and crop monitoring.Volunteer in a community program that promotes sustainable agriculture, and learn about their methods of monitoring pests and crops.

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                            20. PRE-ACTIVITY 6.2: INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT EVOLUTION
(Write your answer on a pad paper)
1. Some snakes have hipbones, which shows they once had four legs like lizards, their close
cousins.
2. Birds evolved from dinosaurs and both are descended from reptiles. The closest living
reptilian relation of a bird is the crocodile.
3.
Most people had brown eyes until about 10,000 years ago when a single genetic mutation
from the Black Sea switched the eyes from brown to blue. Approximately 8% of the world's
population now has blue eyes.
Darwin did not argue that humans came from monkeys. Rather he wrote only that
monkeys, apes, and humans have a common ancestor.
4.
5. Researchers suggest that the discovery of fire influenced human evolution. Fire allowed
humans to cook their food, which made food easier to chew and digest-which, in turn,
contributed to the reduction of human tooth and gut size.
Key Questions:
1. Which fun fact for you is the most interesting? Why do you say so?
2. Which fun fact is already familiar or you already know?
3. The term "evolve or evolution" has been used in many animated series on TV and online,

                            22. 2. Objective In general, academic writing is based on facts and evidence and is not affected by personal emotions. Therefore, to make your essay or research paper convincing, you must use an unbiased style of writing. To maintain an objective tone in your writing, avoid the following: a. personal statement and judgement X I performed an experiment. I believe that fast food contributes to obesity. The experiment was performed. this paper, the effects of fast food consumption on obesity were presented in various studies. In writing a research report, for you to avoid personal pronoun like 'I', use the passive voice. Avoid phrases like 'I believe", "I think", or "I feel" because it may indicate bias. DIVCT b. emotional language X It is unfortunate that many Filipinos do not have work these days. Based on the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data, about half or 48.2% of unemployed Filipinos are from ages 18-24. Instead of emotional language, include facts or evidence to prove your point.​</h2><br />
                        <p>According to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), it has been found that a significant portion of unemployed Filipinos falls within the age range of 18-24. Specifically, approximately 48.2% of unemployed Filipinos belong to this age group.</p><p></p><p>These numbers are quite concerning, as the age range of 18-24 is a crucial period in a person's life for building their career and establishing financial independence. Being unemployed during this stage can have significant long-term consequences on one's career trajectory and earning potential.</p><p></p><p>The causes of this high rate of unemployment among young Filipinos can be attributed to various factors. One major factor is the mismatch between the skills that young people possess and the requirements of available jobs in the market. There is often a gap between the skills that are taught in schools and the skills that are needed in the workforce, leading to a situation where young people struggle to find suitable employment.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there is a lack of job opportunities available in the country, which further exacerbates the unemployment problem. The pandemic has made things worse, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat and forced to lay off employees. This has resulted in a higher rate of unemployment, particularly among young people who are often employed in sectors that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, such as the service industry.</p><p></p><p>To address this issue, the government and private sector need to work together to create more job opportunities that are suitable for young people. There should also be an emphasis on bridging the skills gap between what is being taught in schools and what is required in the workforce.

                        <p>Chapter 2 </p><p></p><p>Methods of Monitoring Pests and Crops </p><p></p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the various methods of monitoring pests and crops used in the field of agriculture. These methods can be categorized into three main types: traditional methods, modern methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) methods. </p><p></p><p>Traditional Methods </p><p></p><p>Traditional methods of monitoring pests and crops have been used for centuries by farmers to control pests and diseases. These methods rely on observation and experience, and they include: </p><p></p><p>1. Visual Inspection: Farmers regularly inspect their crops for signs of pest infestation, such as chewed leaves, wilting, or discolored areas. They also look for signs of beneficial insects that can control pests. </p><p></p><p>2. Traps: Traps can be used to monitor pest populations. These can be sticky traps or pheromone traps that lure insects to them. </p><p></p><p>3. Manual Removal: Farmers can manually remove pests from crops by handpicking them off or shaking them off plants onto a sheet. </p><p></p><p>4. Chemical Pesticides: Chemical pesticides are still commonly used in traditional methods of pest control. However, their use can have negative effects on the environment and human health. </p><p></p><p>Modern Methods </p><p></p><p>Modern methods of monitoring pests and crops utilize technological advancements to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring. These methods include: </p><p></p><p>1. Remote Sensing: Remote sensing involves using drones or satellite imagery to monitor crop growth and detect abnormalities. </p><p></p><p>2. Sensor-based Monitoring: Sensors can be placed in crops to monitor environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. </p><p></p><p>3.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a comprehensive approach that utilizes multiple methods to reduce pest populations while minimizing the use of chemical pesticides. By understanding and utilizing these methods, farmers can control pests and diseases more effectively, leading to improved crop yields and a more sustainable agricultural system.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sure, I can help you continue Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p></p><p>Literature Review</p><p></p><p>In this chapter, we will review the current literature on pest monitoring and crop management. The literature review will provide insights into the various methods used for monitoring pests and crops, their effectiveness, and their limitations. By reviewing the literature, we can gain a better understanding of the current state of pest monitoring and crop management.</p><p></p><p>Methods of Pest Monitoring</p><p></p><p>One of the most common methods of pest monitoring is visual observation. Farmers use their experience and knowledge to identify pests and their damage to crops. However, visual observation can be limited by human error, the size of the farm, and the ability of farmers to identify all pests accurately. As a result, there has been a growing interest in using technology for pest monitoring, such as remote sensing, aerial drones, and satellite imagery. Remote sensing can provide a global perspective on crop health and pest infestations, while drone-based monitoring can offer high-resolution imagery of specific areas of the farm. However, these technologies have limited access for small-scale farmers.</p><p></p><p>Integrated pest management (IPM) has become a popular approach to pest monitoring. It involves using a variety of methods to control pests while minimizing the use of pesticides. The methods used in IPM include biological control, the use of pest-resistant crops, and cultural control methods like crop rotation, intercropping, and cover crops. By combining these methods, farmers can reduce their dependence on pesticides and control pests more effectively.</p><p></p><p>Methods of Crop Management</p><p></p><p>Crop management involves all the activities that farmers undertake to grow and harvest crops. It includes soil preparation, crop selection, irrigation, fertilization, weed control, and pest management. There are several methods used in crop management, including conventional tillage, minimum tillage, and no-till farming. Conventional tillage is the most common method of soil preparation, but it can lead to soil erosion and decreased soil fertility. Minimum tillage and no-till farming have been shown to improve soil health, reduce erosion, and improve rainwater infiltration.</p><p></p><p>Crop selection is another critical aspect of crop management. Farmers choose crops that are well suited to their climate, soil type, and the local market. The selection of resistant cultivars is essential in reducing pest pressure, particularly for those pests that attack the same crop each season.</p><p></p><p>Irrigation is another critical factor in crop management. The use of irrigation can increase yield, but over-irrigation can lead to waterlogging, soil salinization, and reduced yield. Farmers must ensure that their irrigation schedules match the crop's water requirements.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p></p><p>This chapter reviewed the current literature on pest monitoring and crop management. The review highlighted the various methods used for pest monitoring and their effectiveness. Integrated pest management was identified as a promising approach to pest management, and the use of technology, such as remote sensing and drones, was also discussed. Crop management methods were also highlighted, and the importance of selecting the right crops, irrigation methods, and soil preparation techniques was emphasized. The next chapter will focus on the research methodology used in this study.</p><br />
