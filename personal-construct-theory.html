                                            Every individual undergoes the process of (1) during his/her life time. This refers to the lifelong process of social interaction thorugh which people acquire their identities and all necessary skills for survival in society. Socialization is a necessary social process for it is through this that (2) is taking place. However, as the field of sociology developed over time, socialization was increasingly viewed in the context of (3) . This refers to the process of accepting the social norms, attitudes, roles and values transmitted by people and social groups. (4) view society, for its part, is seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learn to think and behave. On the other hand, (5) sees socialization as an interactive process between individuals and other members of society. This view gives importance to the independence of the individuals and their capacity to define their own personal views and ideas. While, Anthropologist view socialization in terms of becoming familiar with one's own culture and use the term (6) to describe the process of being socialized into one own's culture. It was found out that people who lacked socialization developed mental and physical disabilities.On the other hand, people with successful socialization experiences become (7) in different aspects of life. It is important to remember that (8) are influential in shaping one’s personality. There are several factors that plays an important part of the socialization process. These are: family, peer group, school, church, community, social media and the government. Among these, (9) contributes the most impact on one’s personal development because the crucial and intense socialization happens with it. Becoming part of a particular (10) is a product of socialization. And so, don’t forget to bear in mind that we need to choose the kind of activities we involve ourselves into. For whenever we (11) ,we develop the kind of (12) we have.

It is the act of submitting oneself to the norms and conventions of society. Herbert Kelman identifies three types of conformity: compliance, identification and internalization. (14) refers to the outward conformity to social pressure but privately disagreeing with it. On the other hand, deviance is the opposite of conformity. Deviants are those who do not conform with the norms and laws of society. There are different sociological theories that explains deviance. These are Structuralist theory, Labeling theory, Conflict theory, Structuralist-Functionalists theory, Control theory, Symbolic-interactionist, Subculture view and the Broken glass window theory. The (15) theory analyzes deviance in the framework of competing interests between social groups and the maintenance of power among the elites. While, (16) considers deviance as a socially constructed phenomenom influenced largely by interpersonal relationships between members of society. (17) consider crime and deviance as the result of structural tension and lack of moral regulation within the society. However, there are ways to prevent deviance. We have (18) which is a systematic means and practices used to maintain norms, rules and laws, regulate conflict and discourage deviant behavior. (19) are those provided by laws and other regulations in society, while (20) consists of actions such as ostracism and humiliation.CHOICES: Personality Family Normal Socialization Culture Enculturation Socialize Peers Agents of socialization School Personal development Society Functionalists Acculturation Compliance Interpretevists  Results Internalization Deviant Symbolic-interactionist School Conform Conflict Structuralist-Functionalists  Informal Sanctions Formal Sanctions Sanctions Social control</a>

In this theory, the psychological and physical elements are no longer separated, because both are included in human cognition. In fact, with this theory it is also possible for external factors to be included (<strong>represented</strong>) in the psychological field or field of one's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>chameleon as a person personality:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/29540147</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            8. Every individual undergoes the process of (1) during his/her life time. This refers to the lifelong process of social interaction thorugh which people acquire their identities and all necessary skills for survival in society. Socialization is a necessary social process for it is through this that (2) is taking place. However, as the field of sociology developed over time, socialization was increasingly viewed in the context of (3) . This refers to the process of accepting the social norms, attitudes, roles and values transmitted by people and social groups. (4) view society, for its part, is seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learn to think and behave. On the other hand, (5) sees socialization as an interactive process between individuals and other members of society. This view gives importance to the independence of the individuals and their capacity to define their own personal views and ideas. While, Anthropologist view socialization in terms of becoming familiar with one's own culture and use the term (6) to describe the process of being socialized into one own's culture. It was found out that people who lacked socialization developed mental and physical disabilities.On the other hand, people with successful socialization experiences become (7) in different aspects of life. It is important to remember that (8) are influential in shaping one’s personality. There are several factors that plays an important part of the socialization process. These are: family, peer group, school, church, community, social media and the government.

It is the act of submitting oneself to the norms and conventions of society. Herbert Kelman identifies three types of conformity: compliance, identification and internalization. (14) refers to the outward conformity to social pressure but privately disagreeing with it. On the other hand, deviance is the opposite of conformity. Deviants are those who do not conform with the norms and laws of society. There are different sociological theories that explains deviance. These are Structuralist theory, Labeling theory, Conflict theory, Structuralist-Functionalists theory, Control theory, Symbolic-interactionist, Subculture view and the Broken glass window theory. The (15) theory analyzes deviance in the framework of competing interests between social groups and the maintenance of power among the elites. While, (16) considers deviance as a socially constructed phenomenom influenced largely by interpersonal relationships between members of society. (17) consider crime and deviance as the result of structural tension and lack of moral regulation within the society. However, there are ways to prevent deviance. We have (18) which is a systematic means and practices used to maintain norms, rules and laws, regulate conflict and discourage deviant behavior. (19) are those provided by laws and other regulations in society, while (20) consists of actions such as ostracism and humiliation.CHOICES: Personality Family Normal Socialization Culture Enculturation Socialize Peers Agents of socialization School Personal development Society Functionalists Acculturation Compliance Interpretevists  Results Internalization Deviant Symbolic-interactionist School Conform Conflict Structuralist-Functionalists  Informal Sanctions Formal Sanctions Sanctions Social control</h2><br />
