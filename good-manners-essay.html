                            21. arts essay 50 points direction answer the question below in conscious manner 1 what made a good artist​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Art expresses emotions or is an expression of life. Art is a creation that allows for interpretation of any kind. I have read that art is considered a human skill as opposed to nature, a skill applied to music, painting, poetry etc. I believe that nature is an art as well. If something is made by someone or by nature in a certain way, then it’s unique and special in its own way.
</p><p>
</p><p>Artists will use their unique form of artwork to pass along their views and feelings. The importance and value of art and the artist to society has remained constant throughout history. An innovative way of viewing the world or society around us is produced by the artist through his/her art. Interpreting art depends on a person or artist experiences, their associations, visionary thoughts and culture.
</p><p>
</p><p>Art is just like love and has so many definitions and examples for each. Therefore, I believe that art is not about perfection; art is something that continues to develop and grow as it is seen, meaning to open all generations of emotions, thoughts and human capacities.</p><p></p><p>Art is a creation through observation and interpretation of the art and the portrayal of their craft by the artist in whatever way they want whether it is viewed the same way as the observer or any way they see it. Intelligible and recognized thoughts and emotions of the world is considered to be art. Within the emotions and thoughts of the world, art enables those experiences to be intelligible and recognized.
</p><p>
</p><p>Watson’s famous painting is “Peace and love” where he uses the principle elements to deliver the message of love and peace. Colour is the most dominant and prominent element he uses in the painting. The colour blue is used by him to represent peace and the emotion notion that one may notice when one look at the piece. To support specific important aspect like love, power and strength among blacks, he uses a small amount of red throughout the piece. Brown is used to representing the feeling of home and its comfort. In the background, the use of blue by Watson with a hint of criss-cross lines that coupled with the subject’s hair adds non-tactile depth and texture to the painting.</p><p></p><p>The subject Rastafarian is used by Watson because Rastafarians are usually associated with peace and meditation. If art is considered to be an action, then the person who acts is known as an artist. A person who performs various activities and are considered to be art then the person in a descriptive term called an artist.
</p><p>
</p><p>Communication through art is what the artist use in their craft and works. For the long term, Jamaican artists were known to portray strong feeling through their work and art. Each art and the work in its way represented some ideas, emotions or feelings in either two dimensional or three-dimensional forms.
</p><p>
</p><p>The work of art can either be a real piece or an abstract one depicting or telling stories and ideas. For most people, a piece of art that seem to stir the feelings and emotions of the viewer considers the main enjoyment in art. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps :)</p><br />
