                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Body</p><p></p><p>As the “meat” of the paper, the body is where the main ideas are developed, sources are brought in to support them, and the overall argument is made. Each paragraph within the body should revolve around one major idea and follow the basic guidelines of a paragraph, i.e., topic sentence, idea, support, wrap-up. Outlining is key to writing the paper’s body. With a proper outline, you’ll know how many paragraphs (or ideas) you want to present, what order you want to present them, and what you want to say in them.</p><p>Using the sample outline we created earlier, you can easily see how this paper’s three body paragraphs would be structured, what ideas they will each talk about, and what support will be needed. Notice that each idea/paragraph within the body is supported by evidence. Much of your writing in HCI will demand that you support it with source evidence, so the body is where you would quote, paraphrase, summarize, or present data/information from credible texts.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Should all hospitals use electronic health records?</p><p></p><p>Having looked at the benefits and limited drawback of EHRs, it is abundantly clear that full adoption by hospitals would be the most effective route. Concerns about hacks, lost data, and other information security issues, though legitimate, are not supported by the reality of EHR use. While these security issues exist, their impact and rate of occurrence is not high enough for real concern and the positives of EHR use overshadow them. On the other hand, the advantages of being able to easily transfer information between hospitals or providers, and the fact that this information has a permanent place of storage, make EHRs absolutely necessary. The future of healthcare will rest upon the ability of providers and patients to adapt and adjust to the advantages of technology, so in order to better fulfill the needs of patients, hospitals need to get on board and fully adopt electronic records.</p><p></p><p>▪Topic Sentence</p><p>▪Wrap-up</p><p>▪Restate Main ideas</p><p>▪Point to the future</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p><p>Introductions</p><p></p><p>As their name indicates, introductions should “introduce,” outline, or give an overview of what your paper is going to talk about. This means introducing the topic, outlining the major points that will be discussed, giving relevant background, and presenting a clear thesis (main idea). Introductions are difficult to write if you have not properly outlined your ideas and if you are not aware of the structure needed for your assignment. An introduction should NOT talk vaguely about the topic or give an overly broad background. They should give specific details and bits of information that outline the parts of the paper. As seen in the example below, students should begin their introduction with a clear topic sentence and end with a detailed thesis. Avoid vague language, over-generalizations, or going off-topic.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Stress is defined as a physical, physiological, or emotional condition that creates stresses and can lead to physical sickness in medicine. Stress is a psychological term that refers to both heightened mental and physical states as well as the cause of such conditions. Stress, in general, is your body's reaction to anything that you feel as overwhelming, whether positive or negative. Stress is an unavoidable aspect of life; without it, you would be unable to function. It is critical to determine your optimal level of stress – the equilibrium at which you are most driven – because too much or too little will limit your productivity. Excessive stress can negatively impact your relationships at home, school, and even at work.</p><p>It also deprives your health and energy resources, which may be put to better use. Aside from that, your thoughts and emotions toward yourself can be badly influenced. Also, medical research suggests that stress is responsible for up to 90% of ailments, problems, and diseases. "Eighty-three percent of deaths for adults between the ages of twenty-one and sixty-five are related to lifestyle," according to the United States Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia.

                        <p>When the United States ceased their Philippine colonization, they did not only leave the legacy of basketball, burgers, and, Hollywood movies. They left us a universal language, which is English.</p><p></p><p>Personally learning the language made it possible to read American classics, British tales, and, other kinds of foreign literature. Plus, it gave me confidence that I could easily communicate with other nationalities from online chatting to vacationing and studying abroad. In short, I feel English has provided me the opportunity to access a global buffet of ideas and potential foreign friendships.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it is highly valued to the point that it has become a medium of learning instruction and communication alongside Filipino. In addition to that, it created Taglish, the combination of Tagalog and English. I often hear this variation whenever I visit NCR, particularly, in the areas of Taguig and Makati. In these places, there are more well-off people, and, you can find international citizens in the locale.</p><p></p><p> Moreover, I noticed that there is a common connotation with speaking Taglish, which means a person is sosyal or associated with being rich and well-educated. This could equally mean that English fluency represents class and education. This is alarming yet no surprise for me. After all, the colonial mentality is strong in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the fact that English could threaten our Filipino pride, I believe that is key to achieving globalization because you cannot speak Tagalog in international diplomatic talks. You cannot woo investors with Cebuano or study abroad with only Hiligaynon in mind. You cannot order food in Ilocano when you're vacationing in France. In other words, we can vocally make our presence worldwide. </p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, as we speak in American slang, we must not forget to keep the Filipino pride burning through our dialects and traditions.</p><p></p><br />

In today's digital age, children have access to various online platforms and websites for entertainment and learning purposes. However, it is crucial to supervise children when they are using the internet to ensure their safety.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Supervising children when they use the internet is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, there is a lot of inappropriate content available on the internet, which may not be suitable for children. Parents or guardians must monitor their children's online activity to prevent them from accessing such content. Secondly, the internet can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying and other online threats. By supervising children, parents can ensure that their children are not being bullied or harassed online. Additionally, parents can help their children navigate through tricky situations online and teach them how to deal with online threats.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it is essential to supervise children when using the internet because children may not understand the consequences of their online behavior. They may inadvertently share personal information or engage in risky behavior that could compromise their safety. By supervising their children, parents can educate them on internet safety and teach them how to use the internet responsibly.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, children should be supervised when using the internet to ensure their safety. Parents or guardians must monitor their children's online activity and educate them about internet safety. By doing so, parents can help their children enjoy the benefits of the internet while protecting them from online threats.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Internet has undeniably changed society in countless ways, and while it has had both positive and negative impacts, it has overall made society better.</p><p></p><p>The Internet has revolutionized the way people communicate, allowing them to connect with anyone around the world in an instant. This has made it easier to stay in touch with family and friends, and to find and form new relationships. Additionally, this has allowed for the development of social networks and online communities, which are all dedicated to helping people connect with those who share similar interests.</p><p></p><p>The Internet has also had a profound effect on education and research, making the dissemination of knowledge infinitely easier. People now have access to an unprecedented amount of information and resources, allowing them to pursue their education at their own pace and on their own terms. This has enabled people to learn more quickly and efficiently, and has opened up new opportunities for students of all ages and backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>The Internet has also had a positive impact on business, making it easier for companies to reach a wider audience and expand their operations. Businesses now have access to a global market, allowing them to increase their profits and expand their customer base. This has had a positive effect on the global economy, creating more jobs, increasing economic growth, and ultimately benefiting society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>However, it can be argued that the Internet has had negative impacts as well. It has been argued that the Internet has led to the spread of false information and has created an environment where it is difficult to tell what is true and what is false. Additionally, it has been argued that the Internet has caused people to become isolated, as they are more likely to spend time online than in person.</p><p></p><p>While these arguments have some merit, they do not outweigh the positive impacts that the Internet has had on society. The Internet has provided people with an unprecedented level of access to information and resources, as well as the ability to communicate and connect with people around the world. This has enabled people to pursue their education, find new opportunities, and form new relationships. Additionally, it has had a positive effect on businesses, creating jobs and increasing economic growth. For these reasons, it can be concluded that the Internet has made society better overall.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainliest</p><br />
