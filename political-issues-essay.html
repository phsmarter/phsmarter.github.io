                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>NxP solid</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Arguably, most of the factors affecting human beings are controlled by politics. In the 21st century, politics and politicians are perceived to be a widespread force in the contemporary society. Certainly, those individuals who are in charge of the government are the successful candidates of politics. Therefore, they should not rather run the state on their own, but act on behalf of the public. Government of a nation is tremendously valuable to be left under few people in society. Nations should always embrace democracy; this is because it makes all people be obligated to participate in the public domain, as well as providing an opportunity to be part of public life. According to Magstadt Thomas, numerous global political issues affect international relations of nations. The global political issues include dictatorship, leadership, global warming, democracy, voting behavior, war, revolution, welfare and poverty, citizenship, as well as public policies (Magstadt 5). In most of these, global issues in the political arena are governed and influenced by United Nations together with other international organizations.</p><p>Undoubtedly, dictatorship is one of the global political issues that have influenced many countries in the globe. Most of the countries have been under the brutal leadership and affluence of dictatorship. Dictatorship, is not a concept that began recently, it is among the oldest form of governance. Certainly, human history is abounding with diverse examples of rulers who exhibits poor governance, but are unconstrained and want to remain in power for many years (Magstadt 66). As per the aspects of leadership exhibited in the world, dictatorship form of governance will not end any soon. In the 20th century, many states embraced democracy, but still there were emerging forms of dictatorship in other nations, especially in African countries and nations, which belonged to Soviet Union. These nations include Libya, Zimbabwe, Belarus, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana nakatulong!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Political corruption has existed throughout the ages. It believed to be most prominent in positions of power, because of the role money plays in getting people power. However, over the centuries, corruption has changed so much so as to not match a particular definition of corruption, perpetually growing deceptively harder to find (Ebbe). </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The broadest, most suitable definition which exists today simply states that corruption is any illegal act performed by a politician to produce results which would have been otherwise impossible (Ebbe).  In some cases, government, politicians, and criminals entwine for the sake of amassing money in order to secure their own jobs. This form of corruption was apparent in the mafia’s association</p><p></p><p>This paired with poor law enforcement yields an impossibly hard to get rid of corruption. In Kenya, political corruption has grown rampant. People, who are supposed to be representing the interests of their constituency, instead take money from the constituents to keep their representative positions. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Political corruption is parasitic; it finds a host, and can almost always find a way to survive. Eventually, people grow dependent on this corruption as a means for income, thus forming a symbiosis between the people who benefit from it, and the elites that regulate it. People sometimes ignore the corruption surrounding them, feeling that as long as the politicians do their jobs well, their ‘extra salary’ can’t hurt (BNS).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Generally after revolutions take place, anarchy exists. No new government simply moves into place. During this time, it is easiest for Corruption to take hold of this Government as it forms, limiting or halting the true development of a government for the people. In an environment infested with corruption, any acts of corruption simply become commonplace. Where anarchy exists, people lack the power of representation. If there is a government in which corruption exists, people lack a voice with which to take action.  A government is necessary for the growth of people and nations as a whole. If the government is not legitimate, it will only act as a parasite to its host--the people and the country’s economy.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a society, everyone has the right to lead his/her life accordingly without any discrimination. When this state is achieved where all individuals are considered to be equal irrespective of their caste, gender, colour, profession, and status, we call it equality. Equality can also be defined as the situation where every individual has the same rights and equal opportunity to grow and prosper.  </p><p>
</p><p>Every individual of society dreams for equal rights and access to resources available at their disposal, but there is a lot of discrimination. This discrimination can be due to cultural differences, geographical differences, the colour of the individual, social status and even gender. The most prevalent discrimination is gender inequality. It is not a localised issue and is limited to only certain spheres of life but is prevalent across the globe. Even in progressive societies and top organisations, we can see many examples of gender bias.  </p><p>

                        <p><strong>Political issues are some of the most contentious and divisive topics in modern society. From debates over healthcare and education to disputes over immigration and gun control, political issues have the power to shape the direction of entire nations. In this essay, we will explore some of the most significant political issues facing our world today and argue for a more thoughtful and collaborative approach to addressing these challenges.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the most pressing political issues facing our world today is the growing threat of climate change. Rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events are already having profound effects on the planet, from disrupting food systems to exacerbating poverty and inequality. The scientific consensus is clear: urgent action is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change and transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>However, political leaders and policymakers have been slow to respond to this crisis. Many have been influenced by powerful fossil fuel interests and political ideologies that prioritize short-term economic growth over long-term sustainability. As a result, we have seen inadequate action and outright denial of the reality of climate change, putting future generations at risk.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another significant political issue facing our world today is the rise of nationalism and populism. Across the globe, we have seen the emergence of leaders and movements that appeal to people's fears and prejudices, often at the expense of marginalized groups and democratic institutions. This trend is fueled by factors such as economic insecurity, cultural dislocation, and the proliferation of social media, which has enabled the spread of disinformation and hate speech.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>While nationalism and populism may offer a sense of identity and community for some, they ultimately undermine the principles of democracy and human rights that are essential for a just and equitable society. Instead of promoting division and hostility, we need political leaders who can foster dialogue and collaboration across diverse communities, and who are committed to protecting the rights and dignity of all people.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Finally, political issues surrounding inequality and social justice are increasingly urgent. Despite progress in some areas, such as gender and LGBTQ+ rights, we still see profound disparities in income, wealth, and opportunity between different groups of people. This inequality is perpetuated by systemic factors such as racism, sexism, and ableism, as well as economic policies that favor the wealthy and powerful.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>To address these challenges, we need political leaders who are willing to take bold action to address inequality and promote social justice. This includes policies such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare and education, and investments in affordable housing and public transportation. It also requires a fundamental shift in the way we think about wealth and power, moving away from individualism and competition and towards cooperation and solidarity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, political issues are complex and multifaceted, and they require thoughtful and collaborative approaches to address. We must take urgent action to address issues such as climate change, nationalism, and inequality, and we need political leaders who are committed to promoting dialogue and collaboration across diverse communities. By working together, we can build a more just, equitable, and sustainable world for all people.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Aha just the right question for me since I delve a lot on political debates.</p><p></p><p>As of right now in the situation of our country, we have been on the grasp of multiple problems that has not been thoroughly solved nor given any proper attention and rarely talked about in the news. Common ones are the significant amount of mass unemployed citizens in our country due to the fact that most of our people are lacking education high enough to attain a degree or even simply graduate college, pretty much half of our population have only graduated high school and you can't blame them since life is very miserable and gruesome in our country especially if your born to a family with impoverish wealth that has children of 6 or even more than 6 due to their lack of common sense that breeding 6 children when your poor will result to your sons very malnourish and will probably die. Some who survived are basically slaves to their family since they'll be tasked to work early at the age of 8 going on jeeps to beg for money.</p><p></p><p>Back to the first problem which unemployment, most works are highly demanding the worker to have "experience" of which if your only about to start your career it's very hard to be employed, I have seen examples where such people that has graduated college and even attain a degree still find it hard to be employed. Sometimes it's even worse when your course are not in demand on the job list.</p><p></p><p>Now we shall delve in economic standings, we have been on the inflation long before the covid crisis due to questionable funding's that our government has been doing whether it's related to half-done infrastructures or other rushed projects with low quality materials that does not relay properly to the finished project price when the over-all low quality materials only estimate around 600,000 Pesos and if you include the salary let's say it'll be 1.8 million at the very least but prices are not right when they are declared more than 10 million and with no proper given information why it suddenly changed that substantially. Again that all depends on how big the project it but that is the general perspective on what's happening.</p><p></p><p>As for our Social problems, most families tends to pressure their children to pursue heavy paying careers only to be basically a credit card to their family, buying whatever things the "whole family" lust for, I say whole family because even distant cousins that you do not know will all of sudden beg you for things only for his own happiness.</p><p></p><p>Then the Cultural problems where it has been said by General. Antonio Luna that it's very hard to unite a country that is culturally diverse and are against each other's will. What he says bears the very truth we have now, since our country is divided to 3 parts it all has it's own culture so to speak. I have seen and experience with my own eyes where Filipinos from Visayas, speaks English and they know more of English than "mainland language" in Luzon which is Tagalog, they speak their province language fluently but can barely understand sometimes mainland Tagalog and they would prefer to engage in an English conversation than mainland Tagalog. Point is where not "fiercely united" and still lack cooperation with one another especially the fact that Filipinos are famed for "Crab mentality" since it's very true that we have been against each other for centuries even after we are united. Blood spilled among our own people.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Paki-ayos na lang po para bumagay talaga sa essay, binigyan na kita ng general view sa mga issues ng mga filipino pero marami parin ibang issue na kulang kayo na lang po bahala mag-dagdag.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Poverty can be defined as a state of affairs in which a family's fundamental requirements, such as food, shelter, clothes, and education, are not met on a regular basis. It can lead to a variety of additional issues, such as low literacy, unemployment, starvation, and so on. Because of a lack of financial resources, a poor individual is unable to further their education and hence remains unemployed. An unemployed guy is unable to provide his family with enough and healthy food, resulting in their health deteriorating. A person who is physically weak will be unable to perform the necessary tasks. A person who is out of work will always be destitute. This leads us to believe that poverty is at the heart of all social problems.</p><p></p><p>"Poverty is not a natural phenomenon; it is a result of human activity." The statement above is correct because the majority of the causes of poverty are the result of human activity. There are several factors that contribute to poverty, but the most significant is population growth. The growing population is placing an increasing strain on the resources and budgets of governments. To feed, house, and provide jobs for an increasing number of people, governments are finding it increasingly difficult.</p><p></p><p>Other factors include a lack of education, conflict, natural disasters, a lack of work, a lack of infrastructure, political instability, and a variety of other factors as well. For example, if a person is unable to find work, he or she will become unemployed and will be unable to earn enough money to meet the basic needs of his or her family, resulting in poverty. A person's lack of education forces him to choose lower-paying occupations, which further impoverishes him. Lack of infrastructure means that a country lacks industries, banks, and other financial institutions, which results in a lack of employment prospects. Natural calamities such as floods and earthquakes are also a contributing factor to poverty.</p><br />

It’s disappointing and disheartening, that in a world filled with high standards and great societal issues, we choose to judge those who were born with a different skin and race. Welcome to the present year, where racism still thrives and lives.<br /><br />(Yeah, this can be your intro, I’m kinda lazy to continue this, so you’re on your own)<br /><br /><br />

What will demand the most attention in the next 5, 10, and 20+ years? In this article, which frequently refers to the World Economic Forum’s 17th Edition of the Global Risks Report, we’ll highlight 20 current global issues we must address, including issues related to climate change, COVID-19, social rights, and more. While it’s hardly a comprehensive discussion, it’s a solid introduction to the kinds of concerns facing our world today.</p><p></p><p>#1. Poverty</p><p></p><p>#2. Climate change</p><p></p><p>#3. Food insecurity</p><p></p><p>#4. Refugee rights</p><p></p><p>#5. COVID-19</p><p></p><p>#6. Future pandemic preparation and response</p><p></p><p>#7. Healthcare</p><p></p><p>#8.

Corruption</p><p></p><p>Corruption encompasses a host of actions such as bribery, election manipulation, fraud, and state capture. The World Bank Group names corruption as a barrier to ending extreme poverty and “boosting shared prosperity” for the poorest populations. When it comes to addressing poverty, climate change, healthcare, gender equality, and more, corruption gets in the way. Because corruption is a global problem, global solutions are necessary. Reform, better accountability systems, and open processes will all help.</p><p></p><p>#19. Authoritarianism</p><p></p><p>#20. Global cooperation</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Freedom of the press is an important right that guarantees that the media can operate without the fear of censorship or persecution. As a high school student, I strongly believe in the importance of this fundamental human right. The press has the responsibility of reporting events, ideas and facts in a truthful and unbiased manner. It is a vital part of a democratic society, as it helps to hold those in power accountable and fosters transparency in government.</p><p>Without a free press, important information would be hidden, and governments would have the power to control and manipulate the narrative. This could lead to propaganda and false information being spread, which can be harmful to society. Freedom of the press ensures that news outlets have the freedom to report on issues that are of public interest, without the influence of special interest groups or individuals with ulterior motives.</p><p>In conclusion, freedom of the press is a cornerstone of democracy. It allows for the free flow of information and ensures that people are informed about what is happening in their society. As a young person who is passionate about the future of our country, ensuring that the press has the freedom to report on events and hold people in power accountable is crucial. Governments should respect and uphold press freedom, as it is essential for a free and democratic society.</p><p></p><br />

                            28. construct a simple essay by comparing and contrasting how the issue (Political dynasty) was presented in different media plat forms (print, broadcast, online).​</h2><br />
                        The story of the political dynasty is a familiar one, with stories told across print, broadcast and online media channels. The means by which these channels have chosen to present this issue has been varied, however. Print media for instance has favored the straight narrative and was largely analytical in nature in order to provide background information on generational changes within the party. Broadcast media has opted for a more impartial approach. Programs have generally avoided commenting on the dynasty and have instead focused on the development of competing political dynasties within the party. Online media however has taken an interesting approach to the story, with a solid majority of articles presented as opinion pieces rather than as straight narrative. This is in line with the general trend that online media has been exhibiting, making an effort to present controversial issues from a variety of viewpoints rather than just picking one single point of view that would best suit the needs of the media outlet.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The world is going through rapid changes, and the only constant thing that is in our hands is our health. Being healthy is a choice. Specific guidelines are there to maintain good health, but in the end, it is individual effort and determination. Good health is essential for having a pro-active and fully functioning life. Man is a social animal, and good health ensures social survival. Health, besides being personal, is also social. A healthy person can bring positive changes in society. It is not an end to itself but also the key to creating a better and more reformed community.</p><p>Health can be of varied types; physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and sexual health is some of them. Distress can cause neurotic disorders, and healthy people are less likely to fall prey to them. Physical health refers to the bodily well-being of individuals. It involves maintaining a healthy lifestyle. An individual who follows a balanced diet, replenished with carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, in adequate quantities, usually has better immunity. Health is Wealth means good health is the real treasure. A healthy life enables one to remain positive and face all life challenges.
</p><p>Physical health requires few dedicated efforts, including regular exercise and consumption of a lot of water. Water regulates all our body processes, reduces chances for zits and pimples, and ensures regular bowel movements. Exercises like brisk walking, running, cycling, and skipping help in maintaining proper body weight.</p><p>continuation:</p><p>https://www.aplustopper.com/essay-on-health/#:~:text=Essay%20on%20Health%3A%20The%20World,automatically%20healthy%20in%20their%20bodies.&amp;text=Good%20health%20facilitates%20a%20lot%20of%20other%20body%20processes.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>People tend to have variation of insights about political issues because of several reasons. We are made in power to make a voice and amplify it in highest degree possible but are you brave enough to make one? It's either losing the chance of speaking up or getting the chance of stating your opinion and facts. </p><p></p><p>People have different perceptions about political issues because of two reasons: they support and they not. You should not settle in the middle. If you can see wrong things clearly, then get up and make a point. That's the reason why people don't know where should they go. They tend to be in the safe place when in fact it's not.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
