                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) Obama addressed the subjects of racial tensions, white privilege, and race and inequality in the United States, discussing black "anger", white "resentment", and other issues as he sought to explain and contextualize Wright's controversial comments.</p><p></p><p>2.) As the former president Barack Obama said, "Let's be clear, There are no winners here" as he signed the stop-gap bill. He explained fully the enumerated implementations and its advantages and future benefits. ... But still, some people don't put their trust on Barack Obama's words.</p><p></p><p>3.) A thesis statement clearly identifies the topic being discussed, includes the points discussed in the paper, and is written for a specific ...Always stated in your introduction.</p><p></p><p>4.)He said that the fact is, democracy has never been easy and our Founding Fathers argued about everything. We waged a Civil War. We overcame depression. We’ve lurched from eras of great progressive change to periods of retrenchment.</p><p></p><p>5.) The statement of obama is sound and logical.</p><p></p><p>6.) the readers' emotions; name calling is an invalid argument that deviates from a certain topic and attacks the person; and, appeal to authority uses authoritative support to win an argument.</p><p></p><p>7.) For me yup. because I understand Obama’s speech he wants all people to be equal for everyone no matter what kind of color everyone has. And regardless of the status of different people, for Obama everyone has equal rights</p><p></p><p>8.) Yes, there is an issue similar in the Philippines the issue is that,The Poverty and Inequality in the Philippines remains a challenge until now.The discrimination is always have even in the Philippines. </p><p></p><p>9.)  Wall Street Crash and Great Depression of the 1930's in America.This situation is still facing until current administration. President Obama’s Wall Street reform law created an independent agency to set and enforce clear, consistent rules for the financial marketplace. </p><br />
