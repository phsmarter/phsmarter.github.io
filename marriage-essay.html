                        <p>Answer:</p><p>The arranged marriage is a contract between families, but not between individuals. Before the talks of marriage between the parents occur, each side's parents investigate the others family background. They want to ascertain that the girl's family is of the same class, is of comparable financial situation, is of good reputation, and has no hereditary diseases. If the parents are satisfied, a family friend acts as a liaison between the families and reveals the interest of one family's child to the other.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Marriage has always been between a man and a woman, right? Well, then what happens when you suddenly change the definition and turn it into a “loving, romantic union between committed adults?” (Vogt). It doesn’t work like that. It confuses society and children. What then, is to stand in the way of those who want to make polygamous or incestuous relationships legal? In several countries, “three-way relationships were…granted the full rights of marriage” after same-sex marriage was legalized in such countries(Vogt). Same-sex relationships also cause children psychological problems. Children of homosexual parents “were more than twice as likely to…be…in counseling or therapy”. They were also more likely to identify as being something other than heterosexual (Regnerus). Same-sex marriage is not only disruptive to the societal order, it also disrupts the Constitution. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was an amendment to the Constitution …show more content…</p><p>Catholics believe in many of the same principles other traditional Christians believe: traditional marriage is the only marriage pleasing to God and ultimately for man. Pope Benedict the 16th himself conveyed opposition to gay marriage, not “approv[ing] of legal initiatives that imply a re-evaluation of the life of the couple and the family” (“Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?”).

First, is whether or not the right to marry one that should be granted to everyone regardless of sexual orientation. Secondly, is sexual orientation an innate feature or a personal choice? Third, would legalizing homosexual marriage threaten the sanctity of the institution itself? Lastly, when making a judgment considering people’s rights, one must consider whether or not that judgment will infringe on the rights of others.</p><br />

Marriage is a partnership, and like any partnership, it takes commitment, dedication and hard work to help it to grow strong.Here are some secrets of a happy marriage. If you're suddenly not being able to spend time together, or you're fighting about money, it's especially important to talk about what's going on. If your spouse is trying to talk to you, whether it's to find out what you want for dinner, to tell you about their day, or to discuss a problem in your marriage, listen. Create rituals and family traditions that will have meaning just to you. Go on a date. It helps to reinforce the special feelings that made you fall in love with each other in the first place.

                                Young people in modern society have 
completely different views on marriage. Ones prefer to get married at an
 early age; others, however, tend to postpone marriage until they finish
 their studies and make a successful career. Early marriages have lots 
of advantages, such as experiencing the joy of parenthood and other 
benefits of the wedlock and becoming mature as early as possible, but 
also have some negative sides, such as economic restrictions, 
misunderstanding between partners and inability to get proper education.<br />
On the one hand, marrying young has some advantages. Firstly, due to the
 heavy workload arising from new responsibilities and duties, such as 
earning the living, taking care of children, organizing time properly, 
running the household, the newly married youngsters mature much earlier 
than their peers. Secondly, the earlier the partners get married, the 
more time they spend together, the more obstacles they overcome hand in 
hand, the more mutual interests they have, and, as a result, it is quite
 easy for them to find common ground and see eye to eye on various 
problems. Besides, such spouses are more likely to compromise and to 
comfort each other more successfully. Thirdly, having children is 
another important aspect of family life, which is worth mentioning. The 
idea is that giving birth at an early age is not likely to be followed 
by any health problems. <br />
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages in getting married at an
 early age. To begin with, both partners do not have an opportunity to 
finish their education, as they have to provide for their family and one
 of the spouses is likely to become a breadwinner.   Furthermore, 
marrying young leads to a wide range of problems and inconveniences, 
such as insufficient income and lack of suitable accommodation. This is 
when a young couple realizes that the reality is much tougher, than 
their pure feelings and family life is not always about being lovers, 
but it also demands self-sacrifice. As a...

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>         A good marriage is a commitment between a man and a woman, and this commitment includes love, pleasure tolerance and relaxation, but do you know how to have a good marriage? A good start is the honeymoon. Most couples like to spend their honeymoon abroad. They like to go to places where they can find worm beaches, luxury hotels and restaurants and shopping malls. This way is very helpful to make the couple's love grow up very fast, and to give the couple a good chance to know each other, and when they know each other well they will know how to forgive each other. Other people think that gifts are very important to have a good marriage. The husband can present for his lovely wife: jewelry, perfumes, clothes and flowers. This gift from him will make their life full with pleasure and happiness. We also should not forget that the wife should present some expensive gifts to her husband like perfumes and clothes. In my opinion, gifts are very important. Specially when there is a fight between the couple. These small gifts are very helpful to forget what happened. The most effective way is using the nice sweet words. One word and only one word from the husband or from the wife is fare enough to strengthen their love. The husband can say to his wife that she is more beautiful than the flowers or she is everything in his life, and these few words can change their life in a better way forever. There are a lot of ways to have a good marriage, but we should not forget that both the husband and the wife should acclimate with each other, and they must learn how to forgive each other because we are just human and we make a lot of mistakes. The couple should discover the best way that will support their marriage to become a good and comfortable marriage.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Marriage is the most enjoyable human relationship. It is the most significant event that may happen to one's life. It takes only two people, a man and a woman, to unite and make a successful relationship.</p><p></p><p>To make a happy married relationship. First, you need to have a strong communication with your partner. Both of you should speak about what problems are you both facing. This can lead to both of you strengthening your bond even more.</p><p></p><p>Second, is to have an open mind. We need to be open minded so that there is no resentments that will ocurr. Maturity also is a must.</p><p></p><p>Happy marriage involves two couples who apologizes and forgives all the time. The two must have a strong bond. They should know how to comfort each other with each challenges that they are facing in life. Whether its about financial crisis or family issues, you need to know how to comfort her/him.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#carryonlearning</p><br />

                            20. Cross-cultural marriages add up to racial tolerance. Argumentative essay</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Argumentative Essay:</strong>Cross-cultural marriages add up to racial tolerance.</p><p></p><p>   Cross-cultural marriages have become more prevalent in recent years, and they have been the subject of much debate. Some people argue that cross-cultural marriages lead to cultural erosion, while others believe that they promote racial tolerance. In my opinion, cross-cultural marriages contribute to racial tolerance and understanding in society. In this essay, I will discuss how cross-cultural marriages can promote racial tolerance and help to break down barriers between different cultures.</p><p></p><p>   Firstly, cross-cultural marriages help to promote racial tolerance by exposing people to different cultures and traditions. When two people from different cultures come together, they are forced to learn about each other's customs, beliefs, and values. This can lead to a better understanding of different cultures and help to break down stereotypes and misconceptions. For example, a person from a Western culture who marries someone from an Asian culture will be exposed to a different way of life, different foods, and different customs. This exposure can help to break down barriers and promote understanding between the two cultures.</p><p></p><p>   Secondly, cross-cultural marriages can help to create a more diverse and tolerant society. When people from different cultures come together, they bring with them different experiences, perspectives, and ideas. This diversity can lead to a more tolerant and accepting society, as people learn to appreciate and respect the differences between them. For example, a child born to parents from different cultures may grow up with a more open-minded and accepting view of the world, as they are exposed to different cultures and traditions from a young age.</p><p></p><p>   Finally, cross-cultural marriages can help to reduce racial tensions and promote peace between different cultures. When people from different cultures come together and form relationships, they are less likely to view each other as "other" or "foreign". Instead, they see each other as individuals with their own unique qualities and characteristics. This can help to break down the barriers that often exist between different cultures and promote peace and understanding.</p><p></p><p>   In conclusion, cross-cultural marriages can play an important role in promoting racial tolerance and understanding in society. By exposing people to different cultures, creating a more diverse society, and reducing racial tensions, cross-cultural marriages can help to break down barriers and promote a more peaceful and accepting world. As such, we should encourage and celebrate cross-cultural marriages, as they have the potential to bring people together and promote racial harmony.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Don't forget to leave a like!</p><p>Follow for more!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>“It is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married” (Procon.org), said Barack Obama the 44th and current president of the United States.  The gay right movement started in 1969, riots, struggles, and problems followed after.  In today’s society, it has been showed that people are opening up to gay rights. There has been effort in protecting the gays and discrimination against gays is now considered a hate crime and is illegal. However, gay rights still to this day struggle with state and federal legal circumstances. Same- sex marriage needs to be legal, couples who choose to be of the same-sex should be allowed to celebrate their commitment with each other the way heterosexual couples get to, both publicly and society acceptable.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Why should humans be criticized on who they marry? Same-sex marriage couples need to be able to get legally married. "Marriage is social and cultural; the meaning varies in important ways including historical and cultural boundaries" (Pope).  Marriage should not just be legal for just the opposite sex couples, let people love and commit their lives to whoever they may be with. 17 states in the U.S. today have allowed gay marriage, and have made it legal to get married within a same-sex relationship. This has come very far since 1988 when gay marriage was brought upon: 17 states out of 50 states, that’s a high increase.  “From 1988 to 2012, public support for gay marriage increased at a rate of 1 to1.5 points per year” (Pope). It is pleasant that the opinion and support for gay marriage has increased, everyone is created equal, and everyone should get the same rights. Many states, local governments, and private companies have laws or formal policies..Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Early marriage is regarded as compromising the fundamental rights of children and taking a serious responsibility that children are not psychologically or physically ready. Regardless of the fact that child marriage was prohibited by international law in many countries, 1 in 8 girls in developing countries is married before they turn 15 years old, 1 in 3 girls is married before 18 years old, and in some of the developed countries this number is even higher – approximately 1 in 2(Beyond the Resource Curse, 2016, para. 3).</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Marriage has always been between a man and a woman, right? Well, then what happens when you suddenly change the definition and turn it into a “loving, romantic union between committed adults?” (Vogt). It doesn’t work like that. It confuses society and children. What then, is to stand in the way of those who want to make polygamous or incestuous relationships legal? In several countries, “three-way relationships were…granted the full rights of marriage” after same-sex marriage was legalized in such countries(Vogt). Same-sex relationships also cause children psychological problems. Children of homosexual parents “were more than twice as likely to…be…in counseling or therapy”. They were also more likely to identify as being something other than heterosexual (Regnerus). Same-sex marriage is not only disruptive to the societal order, it also disrupts the Constitution. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was an amendment to the Constitution …show more content…</p><p>Catholics believe in many of the same principles other traditional Christians believe: traditional marriage is the only marriage pleasing to God and ultimately for man. Pope Benedict the 16th himself conveyed opposition to gay marriage, not “approv[ing] of legal initiatives that imply a re-evaluation of the life of the couple and the family” (“Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?”). The LDS Church has also spoken out about its strong opposition to same-sex marriage. They believe that “marriage between a man and a woman was instituted by God and is central to His plan for His children and for the well-being of society” (“Church Instructs")</p><br />
