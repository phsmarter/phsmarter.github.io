 Ethics in Qualitative Research 
Certain ethical challenges in qualitative research necessitate sustained attention of two interconnected worlds: the world of the researcher and the world of the participant. A critical view of some of the ethical challenges in the participants’ andresearchers’ world reveals that how we examine both these worlds’ effects how we design our research. In addition, it reflects the need for researchers to develop an ethical research vocabulary at the inception of their research life through multiple modes. The modes may include dialogue in the spoken and written and visual to affect their aims to adhere to the principles of respect, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice in a way that is mutually beneficial to the participant and the researcher.1 Further, the deliberations in this paper reveal that a critical conscious research ethics are embedded in the unfolding research ethics process involving the participants and the researchers, and both the participant and researcher add equal weight to the transparency of the ethical process and add value to building methodological and ethical rigor to the research.1 The global public health response to COVID-19 could be significantly enhanced by safe, effective vaccines and treatments, reliable measures of correlates of immune protection, and improved scientific knowledge of the disease and its transmission. It is widely agreed that vaccines would be particularly important, and over 100 candidate vaccines are currently being developed . Well designed human challenge studies provide one of the most efficient and scientifically powerful means for testing vaccines, especially because animal models are not adequately generalizable to humans.</a>

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</a>

Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano? Why? You may present your answer in creative way, e.g., using infographic, slogan, poster, 4-linepoem, essay, 4-line song or any presentation at your preference.Rubric5 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts and has no misconception.4 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts but with misconception.3 - Ideas are expressed scientifically but contains several contradictory concepts.2 - Ideas are poorly expressed scientifically.1 - Ideas are vague and unprecise.Note: Score is multiplied by 2Need ko po talaga please help me!​</a>

                                            Assessment Identify what is described in the statements below. 1. This is the short-term status of the atmosphere. 2. This method of combating climate change focuses on reducing the cartoon footprints that humans produce. 3. This phenomenon is described as the trapping of hest that radiates from the surface of the earth. 4. A black sedimentary rock that is a product of decomposition and compression of dead algae and plants from ancient swamps. 5. A kind of greenhouse gas that reacts intensely with the ozone in the atmosphere, causing an ozone hole to open (indicate full name). 6. This event happens when the algae that live with corals leave due to increased ocean temperatures and seawater pH. 7. This method of combating climate change focuses on bracing for the effects of climate change rather than reducing carbon footprints.8. He is the Swedish Chemist who published a paper that quantifies the contribution of carbon dioxide to increasing global temperatures. 9. This phenomenon is observed when gases like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane increase in the amount in the atmosphere. 10. This greenhouse gas is produced when manufacturing man-made fertilizers. It is also formed when the fertilizer itself gets broken down in the soil I. Modified True or False. Write TRUE if the statement is correct, change the underlined word if otherwise. 11. Climate is the average or overall pattern of the weather experienced in a certain region or area. 12. Gases like oxygen, nitrous oxide, and methane are called greenhouse gases because they can trap and reflect heat back to the surface of the earth. 13. The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on June 16. 1991 released more than 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. 14. Adaptation aims to reduce the carbon footprints generated by groups of people or individuals. 15. Carbon sinks are bodies that absorb more carbon than they emit.​Paki sagot Yeth :')</a>

Global warming is the gradual increase in the normal temperature of the earth's climate because the heightened amount of heat energy from the sun striking the earth is being caught up in the atmosphere and not emitted into space. The earth's atmosphere has always accumulated the sun's heat acting like a greenhouse, making sure that the earth maintains temperatures that permit the emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans. Without this greenhouse in the atmosphere, the earth would be freezing. Global warming, however, equates to a greenhouse with highly efficient reflective glass positioned the other way around.

                                            Ethics in Qualitative Research Certain ethical challenges in qualitative research necessitate sustained attention of two interconnected worlds: the world of the researcher and the world of the participant. A critical view of some of the ethical challenges in the participants’ andresearchers’ world reveals that how we examine both these worlds’ effects how we design our research. In addition, it reflects the need for researchers to develop an ethical research vocabulary at the inception of their research life through multiple modes. The modes may include dialogue in the spoken and written and visual to affect their aims to adhere to the principles of respect, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice in a way that is mutually beneficial to the participant and the researcher.1 Further, the deliberations in this paper reveal that a critical conscious research ethics are embedded in the unfolding research ethics process involving the participants and the researchers, and both the participant and researcher add equal weight to the transparency of the ethical process and add value to building methodological and ethical rigor to the research.1The global public health response to COVID-19 could be significantly enhanced by safe, effective vaccines and treatments, reliable measures of correlates of immune protection, and improved scientific knowledge of the disease and its transmission. It is widely agreed that vaccines would be particularly important, and over 100 candidate vaccines are currently being developed .

Ethics in Qualitative Research
Certain ethical challenges in qualitative research necessitate sustained attention of two interconnected worlds: the world of the researcher and the world of the participant. A critical view of some of the ethical challenges in the participants’ and researchers’ world reveals that how we examine both these worlds’ effects how we design our research. In addition, it reflects the need for researchers to develop an ethical research vocabulary at the inception of their research life through multiple modes. The modes may include dialogue in the spoken and written and visual to affect their aims to adhere to the principles of respect, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice in a way that is mutually beneficial to the participant and the researcher.1 
Further, the deliberations in this paper reveal that a critical conscious research ethics are embedded in the unfolding research ethics process involving the participants and the researchers, and both the participant and researcher add equal weight to the transparency of the ethical process and add value to building methodological and ethical rigor to the research.1 
The global public health response to COVID-19 could be significantly enhanced by safe, effective vaccines and treatments, reliable measures of correlates of immune protection, and improved scientific knowledge of the disease and its transmission. It is widely agreed that vaccines would be particularly important, and over 100 candidate vaccines are currently being developed. Well-designed human challenge studies provide one of the most efficient and scientifically powerful means for testing vaccines, especially because animal models are not adequately generalizable to humans. 
Challenge studies could thus be associated with substantial public health benefit in so far as they (a) accelerate vaccine development, (b) increase the likelihood that the most effective (candidate) vaccines will ultimately become available), (c) validate tests of immunity, and (d) improve knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Globalization refers to the interconnectedness of the world's economies, cultures, and societies, resulting in widespread communication and production around the world. While globalization has brought many benefits to various parts of the world, it has also come with its share of disadvantages. In this reflective paper, we will examine the advantages and disadvantages of globalization in the context of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Advantages of Globalization in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>One of the significant advantages of globalization in the Philippines is economic growth. As the world becomes more interconnected, the Philippines has been able to tap into the global market by exporting its products to different parts of the world. This has increased the country's revenue, created job opportunities, and boosted the economy.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage, globalization has led to the integration of technology and innovations, which has enhanced the quality of life in the Philippines. The widespread availability of new technologies and communication channels has made it easier for Filipinos to communicate with each other and the world, access information, and take advantage of new opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages of Globalization in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>While globalization has brought significant benefits to the Philippines, it has also come with its share of disadvantages. One of the significant disadvantages is the widening income gap between the rich and the poor. As multinational corporations set up operations in the country, they often pay their employee's low wages and take advantage of lax labor laws, resulting in a growing divide between the rich and the poor.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, globalization has both advantages and disadvantages in the Philippines. While it has led to economic growth, FDI, and technological advancements, it has also widened the income gap, eroded cultural identity, and contributed to environmental degradation. As the Philippines continues to embrace globalization, policymakers must take steps to address its negative consequences while maximizing its benefits.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</h2><br />

Performance Task 2: Leave and Save life!Objective: Reflect on Earth's energy that all movement comes from Earth's internal heat.What you need: long bond paper, Art MaterialsWhat to do: Read the passage carefully.Earthquake jolt and shake us. Volcanoes erupt, shooting ash and hot gases into the atmosphere andpouring molten rock over the land. Great mountain ranges gradually inch upward, over the course ofmillennia. Earth's geosphere is constantly moving and changing, and the energy for all that movementcomes from Earth's internal heat (Understanding Global Change, 2021).We all knew that Taal Volcano latest eruption happened last January 12, 2020, and it displaced morethan 376,000 people from surrounding towns. Based on the report from NASA, the damage brought by theeruption extended beyond plant life. Large numbers of livestock and pets were also left behind when tensof thousands of people evacuated. Ash even affected the fish-mainly the tilapia and milkfish-being raised inthousands of aquaculture pens in Taal Lake. According to the Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc., about30% of the fish cages in the lake were destroyed during the eruption and to keep the remaining fish alivefarmers appealed the authorities to allow them to feed and harvest the fish to support their living duringlockdowns.Consider yourself as one of the authorities, would you allow the people to get near in still-active-volcano? Why? You may present your answer in creative way, e.g., using infographic, slogan, poster, 4-linepoem, essay, 4-line song or any presentation at your preference.Rubric5 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts and has no misconception.4 - Ideas are expressed scientifically, consistent to the concepts but with misconception.3 - Ideas are expressed scientifically but contains several contradictory concepts.2 - Ideas are poorly expressed scientifically.1 - Ideas are vague and unprecise.Note: Score is multiplied by 2Need ko po talaga please help me!​</h2><br />

                            15. Assessment Identify what is described in the statements below. 1. This is the short-term status of the atmosphere. 2. This method of combating climate change focuses on reducing the cartoon footprints that humans produce. 3. This phenomenon is described as the trapping of hest that radiates from the surface of the earth. 4. A black sedimentary rock that is a product of decomposition and compression of dead algae and plants from ancient swamps. 5. A kind of greenhouse gas that reacts intensely with the ozone in the atmosphere, causing an ozone hole to open (indicate full name). 6. This event happens when the algae that live with corals leave due to increased ocean temperatures and seawater pH. 7. This method of combating climate change focuses on bracing for the effects of climate change rather than reducing carbon footprints.8. He is the Swedish Chemist who published a paper that quantifies the contribution of carbon dioxide to increasing global temperatures. 9. This phenomenon is observed when gases like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane increase in the amount in the atmosphere. 10. This greenhouse gas is produced when manufacturing man-made fertilizers. It is also formed when the fertilizer itself gets broken down in the soil I. Modified True or False. Write TRUE if the statement is correct, change the underlined word if otherwise. 11. Climate is the average or overall pattern of the weather experienced in a certain region or area. 12. Gases like oxygen, nitrous oxide, and methane are called greenhouse gases because they can trap and reflect heat back to the surface of the earth. 13. The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on June 16. 1991 released more than 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. 14. Adaptation aims to reduce the carbon footprints generated by groups of people or individuals. 15. Carbon sinks are bodies that absorb more carbon than they emit.​Paki sagot Yeth :')</h2><br />

                            20. Directions: Read the text and answer the following questions in complete sentences. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. Global warming is the gradual increase in the normal temperature of the earth's climate because the heightened amount of heat energy from the sun striking the earth is being caught up in the atmosphere and not emitted into space. The earth's atmosphere has always accumulated the sun's heat acting like a greenhouse, making sure that the earth maintains temperatures that permit the emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans. Without this greenhouse in the atmosphere, the earth would be freezing. Global warming, however, equates to a greenhouse with highly efficient reflective glass positioned the other way around.

                            21. Ethics in Qualitative Research Certain ethical challenges in qualitative research necessitate sustained attention of two interconnected worlds: the world of the researcher and the world of the participant. A critical view of some of the ethical challenges in the participants’ andresearchers’ world reveals that how we examine both these worlds’ effects how we design our research. In addition, it reflects the need for researchers to develop an ethical research vocabulary at the inception of their research life through multiple modes. The modes may include dialogue in the spoken and written and visual to affect their aims to adhere to the principles of respect, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice in a way that is mutually beneficial to the participant and the researcher.1 Further, the deliberations in this paper reveal that a critical conscious research ethics are embedded in the unfolding research ethics process involving the participants and the researchers, and both the participant and researcher add equal weight to the transparency of the ethical process and add value to building methodological and ethical rigor to the research.1The global public health response to COVID-19 could be significantly enhanced by safe, effective vaccines and treatments, reliable measures of correlates of immune protection, and improved scientific knowledge of the disease and its transmission. It is widely agreed that vaccines would be particularly important, and over 100 candidate vaccines are currently being developed . Well designed human challenge studies provide one of the most efficient and scientifically powerful means for testing vaccines, especially because animal models are not adequately generalizable to humans.Based on the article, how will you define ethics in research?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.Globalization, Modernization, Westernization, and Americanization in the Field of Fashion</p><p>In the field of fashion, globalization has had a significant influence on the way people dress and how fashion is produced and consumed. The spread of Western fashion and American culture through globalization has led to the homogenization of fashion across the world, resulting in similar styles being worn in different countries. Modernization and technological advancements have also impacted the fashion industry by allowing for faster production and distribution of clothing, as well as the use of digital media to promote fashion trends.</p><p></p><p>2.Reading Reflection: "Sensibility in the Era of Global Communication: Semioethic Perspective" by Susan Peyrillli</p><p>In Peyrilli's article, she argues that the increasing globalization of communication has led to a loss of sensibility in the way we perceive and interpret information. She emphasizes the importance of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols, in understanding the complexities of communication in a globalized world. Peyrilli's research highlights the need for a semioethic approach to communication, which considers the ethical implications of how information is conveyed and received.</p><p></p><p>3.Reflective Paper: Advantages and Disadvantages of Globalization in the Philippine Context</p><p></p><p>Globalization has brought both advantages and disadvantages to the Philippines. On the one hand, it has led to the growth of industries such as outsourcing and call centers, providing job opportunities for Filipinos. The spread of Western culture has also influenced Philippine fashion and music, leading to a fusion of traditional and modern styles. However, globalization has also resulted in the exploitation of workers in industries such as manufacturing and agriculture, as well as the displacement of local businesses by multinational corporations. Additionally, the spread of Western ideals has led to a loss of cultural identity and a devaluation of traditional practices.</p><p></p><p>4.Self-Examination</p><p></p><p>Upon examination of myself, I have realized that my cultural identity has been shaped by the process of acculturation. Growing up in a multicultural society, I have been exposed to different beliefs, values, and practices, which have influenced my own cultural identity. Through interactions with people from different backgrounds, I have learned to appreciate the diversity of cultures and to embrace differences. However, I have also experienced pressure to conform to Western norms and ideals, leading to a struggle to maintain a balance between my cultural heritage and Western influences.</p><p></p><p>5.Cultural Identity and Assimilation</p><p>The process of assimilation has played a significant role in shaping my cultural identity. As a second-generation immigrant, I have grown up navigating between two cultures, attempting to reconcile the values and traditions of my parents' culture with those of the Western society in which I was raised. While assimilation has allowed me to integrate into society and to access opportunities, it has also resulted in a loss of some aspects of my cultural heritage. I have worked to maintain connections with my cultural roots through language, food, and traditions, but have also recognized the need to adapt to the society in which I live. Overall, the process of acculturation and assimilation has contributed to a complex and evolving cultural identity.</p><p></p><br />

Ethics in Qualitative Research
Certain ethical challenges in qualitative research necessitate sustained attention of two interconnected worlds: the world of the researcher and the world of the participant. A critical view of some of the ethical challenges in the participants’ and researchers’ world reveals that how we examine both these worlds’ effects how we design our research. In addition, it reflects the need for researchers to develop an ethical research vocabulary at the inception of their research life through multiple modes. The modes may include dialogue in the spoken and written and visual to affect their aims to adhere to the principles of respect, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice in a way that is mutually beneficial to the participant and the researcher.1 
Further, the deliberations in this paper reveal that a critical conscious research ethics are embedded in the unfolding research ethics process involving the participants and the researchers, and both the participant and researcher add equal weight to the transparency of the ethical process and add value to building methodological and ethical rigor to the research.1 
The global public health response to COVID-19 could be significantly enhanced by safe, effective vaccines and treatments, reliable measures of correlates of immune protection, and improved scientific knowledge of the disease and its transmission. It is widely agreed that vaccines would be particularly important, and over 100 candidate vaccines are currently being developed. Well-designed human challenge studies provide one of the most efficient and scientifically powerful means for testing vaccines, especially because animal models are not adequately generalizable to humans. 
Challenge studies could thus be associated with substantial public health benefit in so far as they (a) accelerate vaccine development, (b) increase the likelihood that the most effective (candidate) vaccines will ultimately become available), (c) validate tests of immunity, and (d) improve knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.
Questions: 
1.Based on the article, how will you define ethics in research?
