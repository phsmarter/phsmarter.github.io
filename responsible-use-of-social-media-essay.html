14.This morning was crazy. First, My alarm clock was set for PM instead of AM, so I woke up really late. I just threw on some clothes and ran out the door. Then, I rode my bike as fast as I could and thought that I was going to be late for sure, but when I got there everyone was outside and there were firetrucks all lined up in front of school. I guess somebody pulled the fire alarm before class started. It worked out though, because nobody really noticed or minded that I was ta rdy.

The introduction of social networking sites, in particular, has revolutionized the way we communicate and provided us with an avenue to interact and socialize without having to meet face-to-face with people. 2. Behind all these benefits and advantages, however, lies a myriad of consequences that we often neglect to see. 3. In reality, social networking sites are consuming our lives and daily activities at a rate faster than we can reap their benefits, though some of the adversities may be mitigated through moderation and responsibility. 4. It allow them to continuously socialize with and even meet new people with the same interests, and, not to mention, also keeps them entertained and well-informed with current happenings. 5. Moreover, excessive use of social media distracts us from more important things and activities. 6. Although not immediately visible, social media plays a role in determining a person's mental well-being. 7. Another issue with social networking sites is the fact that it is so liberated that it makes it prone to different risks and crimes. 8. As a result, we, as users of social media, have to be more sensitive and cautions of what we post online in order to prevent harming ourselves or other people. 9.
