                                            Case Study: Jenns Barr Construction Supply Miss Jennilyn Barrientos is currently trying hard to make a decision on whether or not she would continue her construction supply business. Jennilyn was raised by her parents as a God-fearing and descent person. She does not fail to go to church every Sunday. She graduated valedictorian at the La Salette High School. The University of Santo Thomas awarded her a diploma in Business Administration with highest honors. It was while studying in UST when she met Jefferson, a townmate who was also enrolled in the College of Engineering of the same university. He courted her and after sometime, she agreed to marry him one year after graduation. On the day of the nuptial, Jefferson did not appear. Jennilyn felt humiliated, but after a few months of desperation, she bounced back and got a job in a commercial bank. Two years later, she was promoted supervisor and after a year she became the manager of the branch. She began to think that a job in a bank does not provide her with enough opportunities to prove her real worth. She entertained thoughts about operating a small business. She resigned from the bank and started to make moves to effectively operate a construction supply business. Jennilyn’s parents own a vacant 1,000 square meter lot at the edge of the town’s business district. Directly in front of the national highway and its back is the city road. The place is an ideal site for a construction supply business. Her parents agreed to construct a building to house her business on the condition that she would pay rent. Just a month after she started operating, her assistant informed her of the need to convince a top rated contractor to buy from them. Jennilyn agreed to meet him. A few days later, when Jennilyn was in her office, her assistant came rushing to inform her the prospect has arrived to meet her. Jennilyn was shocked when she saw that the potential customer was her former boyfriend. Jefferson shook her hand and asked how she was. She tried hard to hide displeasure and said she’s fine. They talked for a few minutes and then he left. Once more, Jennilyn felt a rising anger within her. She wants to avoid the guy, so she is considering shifting to another type of business like that of drug wholesaling or hospital supplies. Guide Questions What would be your advice to Jennilyn? Does she need to shift to another type of business?​</a>

                                            In Albuquerque, New Mexico, a well-known food establishment, identified as Restaurant JRD, had been packing customers in for years. The owners took pride in keeping the establishment spotlessly clean and serving daily thousands of thick juicy steaks and gigantic potatoes.When some baked potatoes were left at closing time, they were stored on a kitchen counter or shelf overnight. The next morning, the salad chefs would arrive to peel, dice, and mix the leftover potatoes with other ingredients to make the side order special of the day: potato salad. This had been a standard practice for years. The finished product was put into containers and chilled before serving at noon.One (1) day, the potato salad was made and served as usual. Customers came in for lunch and some ate potato salad. The next day, 34 customers were hospitalized for botulism; two (2) died. Before this incident, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defined Potentially Hazardous Food (PHF) as any moist, high protein food capable of supporting rapid bacterial growth. After this deadly incident, the FDA included cooked potatoes in the list of PHF.Questions:1. How did those customers get botulism from potato salad?2. What should be Restaurant JRD’s game plan to prevent such an incident from happening again?​</a>

As soon as hire anyone, I give him or her verbal instructions on what I expect them to do. Once a week, I call everyone to a meeting and I relay to them my general Instructions for the week." Marylou and her twin sister, MaryAnn, jointly own and manage TWIN SISTERSNOODLE HOUSE. Their main shop is located at Malolos with a complement of nineEmployees composed of a supervisor, a cook, an assistant cook, a cashier, two waiters,A driver, a security guard, and a janitor. At the beginning, there were only three of them,The twins and a helper. They did all they can to make the venture a viable concern.Between the three of them, they performed the various functions related to cooking,Purchasing, promoting, maintaining cleanliness, and the like. As customers slowlyPoured in, they gradually hired people until there were nine of them. Five years after their successful Malolos operations, the twins opened a branchAt a junction in Plaridel. MaryAnn took charge of managing the branch. Within a fewMonths, the branch showed potentials greater than the Malolos main. The twins were experiencing the joys of a successful venture when Marylou suddenly took a leave to undergo surgery to remove gallstones in her system. The situation forced MaryAnn to simultaneously manage the two outlets. After a while, the cook in Malolos began to experience discomfort in MaryAnn'sManagement style. He complained about the restrictive policies of MaryAnn. He wasScolded several times for doing what he normally did when Marylou was supervised. For instance, MaryAnn questioned the quality of seasoning he applies on the food he cooks. He was also scolded for using kitchen utensils on instances Marylou Thought as inappropriate. The cook started to harbor ill feelings toward MaryAnn. He thought he can noLonger work effectively under such conditions. When a job opening for another restaurant was relayed to him by a friend, he applied. When he was informed that he will be hired, he resigned from Twin Sisters Noodle House. Guide Questions:     Is there anything wrong with the set-up of the firm?     If you were MaryAnn, what will you do?​</a>

                            7. Case Study: Jenns Barr Construction Supply Miss Jennilyn Barrientos is currently trying hard to make a decision on whether or not she would continue her construction supply business. Jennilyn was raised by her parents as a God-fearing and descent person. She does not fail to go to church every Sunday. She graduated valedictorian at the La Salette High School. The University of Santo Thomas awarded her a diploma in Business Administration with highest honors. It was while studying in UST when she met Jefferson, a townmate who was also enrolled in the College of Engineering of the same university. He courted her and after sometime, she agreed to marry him one year after graduation. On the day of the nuptial, Jefferson did not appear. Jennilyn felt humiliated, but after a few months of desperation, she bounced back and got a job in a commercial bank. Two years later, she was promoted supervisor and after a year she became the manager of the branch. She began to think that a job in a bank does not provide her with enough opportunities to prove her real worth. She entertained thoughts about operating a small business. She resigned from the bank and started to make moves to effectively operate a construction supply business. Jennilyn’s parents own a vacant 1,000 square meter lot at the edge of the town’s business district. Directly in front of the national highway and its back is the city road. The place is an ideal site for a construction supply business. Her parents agreed to construct a building to house her business on the condition that she would pay rent. Just a month after she started operating, her assistant informed her of the need to convince a top rated contractor to buy from them. Jennilyn agreed to meet him. A few days later, when Jennilyn was in her office, her assistant came rushing to inform her the prospect has arrived to meet her. Jennilyn was shocked when she saw that the potential customer was her former boyfriend. Jefferson shook her hand and asked how she was. She tried hard to hide displeasure and said she’s fine. They talked for a few minutes and then he left. Once more, Jennilyn felt a rising anger within her. She wants to avoid the guy, so she is considering shifting to another type of business like that of drug wholesaling or hospital supplies. Guide Questions What would be your advice to Jennilyn? Does she need to shift to another type of business?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My advice to her is to be professional. She is in the field of business and personal issues should be disregarded when it comes to business. Also she only started her business so, no, she doesn't need to shift. </p><p></p><br />

                            9. In Albuquerque, New Mexico, a well-known food establishment, identified as Restaurant JRD, had been packing customers in for years. The owners took pride in keeping the establishment spotlessly clean and serving daily thousands of thick juicy steaks and gigantic potatoes.When some baked potatoes were left at closing time, they were stored on a kitchen counter or shelf overnight. The next morning, the salad chefs would arrive to peel, dice, and mix the leftover potatoes with other ingredients to make the side order special of the day: potato salad. This had been a standard practice for years. The finished product was put into containers and chilled before serving at noon.One (1) day, the potato salad was made and served as usual. Customers came in for lunch and some ate potato salad. The next day, 34 customers were hospitalized for botulism; two (2) died. Before this incident, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defined Potentially Hazardous Food (PHF) as any moist, high protein food capable of supporting rapid bacterial growth. After this deadly incident, the FDA included cooked potatoes in the list of PHF.Questions:1. How did those customers get botulism from potato salad?2. What should be Restaurant JRD’s game plan to prevent such an incident from happening again?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p>1. From my own understanding of the given situation above, the customer got botulism from potato salad because of the improper food handling of the baked potatoes. As we all know when the food is cooked, there is a proper temperature safe zone in which a food must maintain so that the bacteria will not grow or to avoid food contamination.</p><p>2. The Restaurant JRD’ must practice proper food handling in order to avoid any unwanted events that may lead to the death of their beloved customers. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            12. Twin Sisters Noodle House: Don’t Ever Leave Me The lady manager of a bank's branch in Malolos City was amused to hear her high school classmate, Marylou Andres, declare: "In my noodle house business, I never use paper to communicate with my subordinates. As soon as hire anyone, I give him or her verbal instructions on what I expect them to do. Once a week, I call everyone to a meeting and I relay to them my general Instructions for the week." Marylou and her twin sister, MaryAnn, jointly own and manage TWIN SISTERSNOODLE HOUSE. Their main shop is located at Malolos with a complement of nineEmployees composed of a supervisor, a cook, an assistant cook, a cashier, two waiters,A driver, a security guard, and a janitor. At the beginning, there were only three of them,The twins and a helper. They did all they can to make the venture a viable concern.Between the three of them, they performed the various functions related to cooking,Purchasing, promoting, maintaining cleanliness, and the like. As customers slowlyPoured in, they gradually hired people until there were nine of them. Five years after their successful Malolos operations, the twins opened a branchAt a junction in Plaridel. MaryAnn took charge of managing the branch. Within a fewMonths, the branch showed potentials greater than the Malolos main. The twins were experiencing the joys of a successful venture when Marylou suddenly took a leave to undergo surgery to remove gallstones in her system. The situation forced MaryAnn to simultaneously manage the two outlets. After a while, the cook in Malolos began to experience discomfort in MaryAnn'sManagement style. He complained about the restrictive policies of MaryAnn. He wasScolded several times for doing what he normally did when Marylou was supervised. For instance, MaryAnn questioned the quality of seasoning he applies on the food he cooks. He was also scolded for using kitchen utensils on instances Marylou Thought as inappropriate. The cook started to harbor ill feelings toward MaryAnn. He thought he can noLonger work effectively under such conditions. When a job opening for another restaurant was relayed to him by a friend, he applied. When he was informed that he will be hired, he resigned from Twin Sisters Noodle House. Guide Questions:     Is there anything wrong with the set-up of the firm?     If you were MaryAnn, what will you do?​</h2><br />
