                                            Rizal was not a handsome man. In physique, he was neither dashing nor imposing, for he was a shy small man – a few inches above five feet in height. But he possessed an aura of charisma due to his many-splendored talents and noble character, which made him attractive to romantic young women. No wonder the prettier of Don Pablo’s daughters (Consuelo) fell in love with him.Rizal being a lonely man in a foreign country, far from his natal land, was attracted by Consuelo’s beauty and vivacity. He even composed a lonely poem on August 22, 1883 dedicated to her. In this poem titled A La Senorita C. O. y P. (To Miss C. O. y P.) he expressed his admiration for her. He found solace and joy in her company.However, before his romance with Consuelo could blossom into a serious affair, he suddenly backed out for two reason: (1) he was still engaged to Leonor Rivera and (2)   his friend and co-worker in the Propaganda Movement, Eduardo de Lete, was madly in love with Consuelo and he had no wish to break their friendship because of a pretty girl.FINANCIAL WORRIESAfter Rizal's departure for Spain, things turned from bad to worse in Calamba.On top of this economic disaster, the manager of Dominican-owned hacienda increased the rentals of the lands cultivated by Rizal family. This hacienda manager, a frequent guest at the Rizal's home, used to ask for a turkey from Don Francisco (the hero's father) who was a good raiser of turkey.Due to hard times in Calamba, the monthly allowances of Rizal in Madrid were late in arrival and there were times when they never arrived, causing much suffering to him.Paciano sell his younger brother's pony in order to send money to Madrid.A touching incident in Rizal's Life in Madrid occured on June 12, 1884.With an empty stomach he attended his class at the university, participated in the contest in Greek language and won the gold medal. he was a great speaker in a banquet held in honor of Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgi at Restaurant Ingles, Madridexplain every paragraph, badly need, ty​</a>

Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

There is no other Filipino like Jose Protacio Rizal. He was the greatest Filipino of the nineteenth century and possibly of the past and future generations as well. He was a shining example of the height and glory to which a Filipino could possibly rise. Rizal was born in Calamba, Laguna, on June 19,1861. He came from a very well-known and respected family of traders and farm owners.Please needs q na ngaun bukas na pasahan oh.Klokohan=report:&gt;Brainlist q tama​</a>

Tagging intellectuals as detabilizers continues through the 1880's and 1890's especially during the height of the propaganda movement in Europe.

                            11. Rizal was not a handsome man. In physique, he was neither dashing nor imposing, for he was a shy small man – a few inches above five feet in height. But he possessed an aura of charisma due to his many-splendored talents and noble character, which made him attractive to romantic young women. No wonder the prettier of Don Pablo’s daughters (Consuelo) fell in love with him.Rizal being a lonely man in a foreign country, far from his natal land, was attracted by Consuelo’s beauty and vivacity. He even composed a lonely poem on August 22, 1883 dedicated to her. In this poem titled A La Senorita C. O. y P. (To Miss C. O. y P.) he expressed his admiration for her. He found solace and joy in her company.However, before his romance with Consuelo could blossom into a serious affair, he suddenly backed out for two reason: (1) he was still engaged to Leonor Rivera and (2)   his friend and co-worker in the Propaganda Movement, Eduardo de Lete, was madly in love with Consuelo and he had no wish to break their friendship because of a pretty girl.FINANCIAL WORRIESAfter Rizal's departure for Spain, things turned from bad to worse in Calamba.On top of this economic disaster, the manager of Dominican-owned hacienda increased the rentals of the lands cultivated by Rizal family. This hacienda manager, a frequent guest at the Rizal's home, used to ask for a turkey from Don Francisco (the hero's father) who was a good raiser of turkey.Due to hard times in Calamba, the monthly allowances of Rizal in Madrid were late in arrival and there were times when they never arrived, causing much suffering to him.Paciano sell his younger brother's pony in order to send money to Madrid.A touching incident in Rizal's Life in Madrid occured on June 12, 1884.With an empty stomach he attended his class at the university, participated in the contest in Greek language and won the gold medal. he was a great speaker in a banquet held in honor of Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgi at Restaurant Ingles, Madridexplain every paragraph, badly need, ty​</h2><br />

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.
