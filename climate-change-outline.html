                                            Direction: Create a reading outline of the text below. You may use the format given below. The Environment In our modern world, there are many factors that place the wellbeing of the planet in jeopardy. While some people have the opinion that environmental problems are just a natural occurrence, others believe that human beings have a huge impact on the environment. Regardless of your viewpoint, take into consideration the following factors that place our environment as well as the planet Earth danger.Global warming or climate change is a major contributing factor to environmental damage. Because of global warming, we have seen an increase in melting ice caps, a rise in sea levels, and the formation of new weather patterns. These weather patterns have caused stronger storms, droughts, and flooding in places that they formerly did not occur.Air pollution is primarily caused as a result of excessive and unregulated emissions of carbon dioxide into the air. Pollutants mostly emerge from the burning of fossil fuels in addition to chemicals, toxic substances, and improper waste disposal. Air pollutants are absorbed into the atmosphere, and they can cause smog, a combination of smoke and fog, in valleys as well as produce acidic precipitation in areas far away from the pollution source.In many areas, people and local governments do not sustainably use their natural resources. Mining for natural gases, deforestation, and even improper use of water resources can have tremendous effects on the environment. While these strategies often attempt to boost local economies, their effects can lead to oil spills, interrupted animal habitats, and droughts.Ultimately, the effects of the modern world on the environment can lead to many problems. Human beings need to consider the repercussions of their actions, trying to reduce, reuse, and recycle materials while establishing environmentally sustainable habits. If measures are not taken to protect the environment, we can potentially witness the extinction of more endangered species, worldwide pollution, and a completely uninhabitable planet. ​</a>

                                            Enrichment 4, Fourth Quarter
 Biodiversity provides many goods and services essential to life on earth. The management of natural resources can determine the baseline health status of a community. Environmental stewardship can contribute to secure livelihoods and improve the resilience of communities. The loss of these resources can create the conditions responsible for morbidity or mortality.
 Biodiversity supports human and societal needs, including food and nutrition security, energy, development of medicines and pharmaceuticals and freshwater, which together underpin good health. It also supports economic opportunities, and leisure activities that contribute to overall well being.
 Land use change, pollution, poor water quality, chemical and waste contamination, climate change and other causes of ecosystem degradation all contribute to biodiversity loss and can pose considerable threats to human health.
 Human health and well-being are influenced by the health of local plant and animal communities, and the integrity of the local ecosystems that they form.
Infectious diseases cause over one billion human infections per year, with millions of deaths each year globally. Approximately two diseases are shared with animals, and most recently emerging diseases are associated with wildlife.

The Environment In our modern world, there are many factors that place the wellbeing of the planet in jeopardy. While some people have the opinion that environmental problems are just a natural occurrence, others believe that human beings have a huge impact on the environment. Regardless of your viewpoint, take into consideration the following factors that place our environment as well as the planet Earth danger.Global warming or climate change is a major contributing factor to environmental damage. Because of global warming, we have seen an increase in melting ice caps, a rise in sea levels, and the formation of new weather patterns. These weather patterns have caused stronger storms, droughts, and flooding in places that they formerly did not occur.Air pollution is primarily caused as a result of excessive and unregulated emissions of carbon dioxide into the air. Pollutants mostly emerge from the burning of fossil fuels in addition to chemicals, toxic substances, and improper waste disposal. Air pollutants are absorbed into the atmosphere, and they can cause smog, a combination of smoke and fog, in valleys as well as produce acidic precipitation in areas far away from the pollution source.In many areas, people and local governments do not sustainably use their natural resources. Mining for natural gases, deforestation, and even improper use of water resources can have tremendous effects on the environment. While these strategies often attempt to boost local economies, their effects can lead to oil spills, interrupted animal habitats, and droughts.Ultimately, the effects of the modern world on the environment can lead to many problems. Human beings need to consider the repercussions of their actions, trying to reduce, reuse, and recycle materials while establishing environmentally sustainable habits. If measures are not taken to protect the environment, we can potentially witness the extinction of more endangered species, worldwide pollution, and a completely uninhabitable planet. ​</h2><br />

                            21. Enrichment 4, Fourth Quarter
 Biodiversity provides many goods and services essential to life on earth. The management of natural resources can determine the baseline health status of a community. Environmental stewardship can contribute to secure livelihoods and improve the resilience of communities. The loss of these resources can create the conditions responsible for morbidity or mortality.
 Biodiversity supports human and societal needs, including food and nutrition security, energy, development of medicines and pharmaceuticals and freshwater, which together underpin good health. It also supports economic opportunities, and leisure activities that contribute to overall well being.
 Land use change, pollution, poor water quality, chemical and waste contamination, climate change and other causes of ecosystem degradation all contribute to biodiversity loss and can pose considerable threats to human health.
 Human health and well-being are influenced by the health of local plant and animal communities, and the integrity of the local ecosystems that they form.
Infectious diseases cause over one billion human infections per year, with millions of deaths each year globally. Approximately two diseases are shared with animals, and most recently emerging diseases are associated with wildlife.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Climate Change: A Global Crisis that Needs Urgent Attention</p><p></p><p>Climate change is an issue that has been gaining increasing concern for many years now. It is a global crisis that affects everyone, regardless of nationality, race, or social status. Climate change refers to the long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other weather patterns that have been observed and linked to human activity. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities have caused a significant increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which leads to global warming and other climate-related problems.</p><p></p><p>The effects of climate change are already evident and are becoming more severe with each passing year. The rise in sea levels, the increase in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, and the loss of biodiversity are just some of the consequences of climate change. These problems not only impact the environment but also have negative economic and social effects on communities around the world. For example, the loss of agricultural productivity due to droughts can lead to food shortages and higher prices, which can exacerbate poverty and hunger.</p><p></p><p>Despite the growing awareness of climate change, there is still much work to be done to mitigate its effects. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting sustainable practices. This includes investing in renewable energy, reducing waste, and promoting conservation efforts. By taking action now, we can help to slow the effects of climate change and protect our planet for future generations. It's time for us all to take responsibility for our actions and work together to address this urgent global crisis.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>:))</p><p></p><br />
