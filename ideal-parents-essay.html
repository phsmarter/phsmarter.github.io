                            4. Write an essay about your IDEAL PERSON</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>My Ideal Person Essay</strong><p>Human beings are not perfect. We all have some form of deficiency that deny us the coveted tag of perfection. It may be a character flaw or a physical disability. We all have something that we are not proud of. Something that makes us so uncomfortable that our confidence levels plummet to zero whenever we think about it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While there are things we cannot change about ourselves, such as height, intelligence, race or size of our fingers, there are other factors in our lives that we can change and they are the ones that really matter. We are not remembered for our tallness or brownness, we are remembered for our virtues or vices. Therefore, an ideal person is one who possesses all character traits that are considered virtues in society.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When I talk about an ideal person, one person comes to mind- Mother Teresa. Her name has become synonymous with sacrifice and selfless generosity. People know her from all over the world, both in the religious and secular circles. Though she was not perfect, her life embodied what I would refer to as the ideal personality. One of her best qualities was piety. She was a very faithful and religious woman.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother Teresa was a staunch catholic. At the tender age of 18 years, she joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin and became a nun. She therefore dedicated all her life towards a religious and humanitarian course and never looked back. There were instances where she felt like God had forgotten her and even questioned whether God really existed. However, she never left her catholic faith.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She was also very generous. She spent most of her life serving the poor. Form her own account, which she labeled as “a call within a call,” God spoke to her and commanded her to go help the slum dwellers in Calcutta, India. After receiving approval from Vatican, she relocated to Calcutta for the rest of her life. Using her meagre resources, she wholeheartedly helped the poor and the sick.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She left behind a lifestyle of stability and opulence, took a vow of charity, chastity and poverty and then went to a foreign country to live with the destitute. During her life, she suffered from many illnesses and injuries, including malaria, pneumonia and two heart attacks. She also had broken collar bone. The several setbacks she faced however did not deter her from moving on with her course.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother Teresa was also a leader and she led by example. When she saw things were not okay and people were suffering, she took it upon herself to help them. With all the poverty and misery that surrounded her, she always had the strength to put on a smile. One of the traits of great leaders is that they always give people hope when there seems to be none.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That was Mother Teresa. People rushed to her for comfort and assistance and she always found a way to help them. When she arrived in Calcutta, there was wide spread of diseases in the slums. She went to a medical institution, trained to be practitioner and went back to the slums to treat the affected. She also established various health centers to deal with the rampant spread of diseases, including leprosy that was wreaking havoc in the slums.</p><p></p><p>She was also very principled. She had her own set of beliefs that she followed to the letter and never faltered whenever she faced criticism or opposition. She openly opposed divorce, abortion and contraception. While receiving her Nobel Peace Prize for her unwavering service to humanity, she aired her critique on abortion without fear. She opined in her speech, “…I feel the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a direct war- a direct murder by the mother herself…” Although she received too much public backlash for her stance on abortion, contraception and divorce, she was unperturbed and made it clear to the whole world about her position.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>For me, my ideal girl is someone who is kind-hearted, compassionate, and has a good sense of humor. She should be someone who is easy to talk to and understands the importance of effective communication in a relationship.</p><p></p><p>Physical appearance is not a top priority for me, but I do appreciate someone who takes care of themselves and presents themselves well. A woman who is confident in her own skin and comfortable with who she is, is highly attractive to me. Additionally, someone who is independent and ambitious is also important, as I believe that having individual goals and aspirations helps to build a strong foundation for a healthy relationship.</p><p></p><p>In summary, my ideal girl is someone who possesses inner beauty, is kind-hearted, and has a good sense of humor. While physical appearance is not the most important factor for me, I do appreciate someone who takes care of themselves and is confident in their own skin. Ultimately, a strong and healthy relationship is built on mutual understanding, effective communication, and shared values.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Ideal Self Who/what do you want to achieve/have, why? In the shorter term (3 years), I want to graduate from HELP University’s Degree of Psychology in first-class honours. I understand claims stating such academic achievement is merely a graduation certificate, without guarantee of work opportunities. However, my aim is not motivated towards work opportunities or anything materialistic; I just want to appreciate and value every learning opportunity. Besides viewing this process as a foundation for future knowledge and abilities, I have been anticipating this stage of gaining deeper and professional knowledge in psychology for a long time. To summarize, this goal is elicited from my passion and enthusiasm for psychology, to remain focused throughout these three years, instead of gaining fame or impress others. After graduation, I want to engage in a job related to psychology, allowing me to serve others by applying the knowledge learnt. It may not need to be anything very great; I just hope to contribute to the society’s wellbeing, whether it is in the clinical setting, corporate world or any other aspects. Most importantly, I hope to raise awareness and acceptance towards mental disorders. Even though my effort alone may not be significant to the society, I believe that my effort would at least support those in my surrounding</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>thus is the answer </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Self-concept is generally thought of as our individual perceptions of our behavior, abilities, and unique characteristics—a mental picture of who you are as a person. 1﻿ For example, beliefs such as "I am a good friend" or "I am a kind person" are part of an overall self-concept. One's self-concept is a collection of beliefs about oneself. Generally, self-concept embodies the answer to "Who am I?". Self-concept is distinguishable from self-awareness, which refers to the extent to which self-knowledge is defined, consistent, and currently applicable to one's attitudes and dispositions. </p><br />

                            19. Essay about ideal family​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>my ideal family is having happy , contented, blessed and understanding family members.</p><p></p><p>when your family is supportive you'll felt blessed because nothing else your going to wish for you just need to pray for their health </p><p></p>
꒰ Answer ꒱ˀˀ ↷<p>        For me, an ideal family would be a family who never fails to show care and appreciation. This attitude in our family is always present because we talk to each other when a member in our family is having problems. We never fail to pray together during Sundays and before having our meals. This is a fact that m,y ideal family and my own have many similarities because we help and protect each other as a complete family.
</p><p>
</p><p>       Lastly, an ideal family for me always accepts each member in the family for who they are. A family who will always be there for you every time and accepts you for your failures and mistakes. My family takes the role of forming my own identity and accepting me for myself. All of us will stand together against any problem that arises in our family. This is what makes my family similar to my ideal family.</p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>its just an example, but u can refer to the essay</p><p></p><p></p>

                            21. what do you think are the characteristics of an ideal parents​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Following are 10 traits of a good enough parent: 1. Patience. I’m sure you knew this would be at the top of the list! Children are messy, noisy, don’t listen well, and at times exasperating. Kids can be pretty wonderful, too. But patience is a necessary attribute to develop when raising children. Learning to take a deep breath as needed can help more than just your parenting skills. 2. Multi-tasking skills. Managing the house, going to work, and raising children requires the ability to multi-task. Kids tend to pull your attention away from whatever you’re doing, and it’s not easy to regain your focus — especially when you’re trying to get dinner on the table before soccer practice and they’re asking for help with their homework. 3. Encouraging. Unfortunately, children quickly learn to doubt themselves and worry about the opinions of others, especially among their peers. One of the best ways to avoid this outcome is to encourage your kids. With enough encouragement and support, your child can develop a positive self-esteem and become their best self. 4. Intelligence. One of the hallmarks of intelligence is the ability to problem-solve. Children provide a unique set of challenges that have to be solved. A little brain power can help you to navigate the minefield that parenting can entail. Demonstrating the ability to problem-solve effectively also provides powerful role modeling for your child, which will help set the stage for their own ability to problem solve over time. 5. Flexibility. Many of your parenting attempts will fail. (By the way, just in case you need a good laugh, search for “parenting fails” on Pinterest!) You must be flexible enough to have multiple solutions up your sleeve. When one idea doesn’t work, you can always try something else. Plans are ever changing, too. It helps if you can go with the flow while remaining calm. 6. Leadership skills. You might be able to boss your kids around, but they’ll resent it, and they usually don’t forget. It’s more effective to have strong leadership skills and only throw your parental weight around when necessary. This positive role-modeling will encourage your child to develop leadership skills as well. 7. Dependability. Kids feel safe when they have reliable and dependable parents. They have to know that you’re there for them, no matter what. How much can your kids trust your word? Ask yourself how reliable your friends consider you to be and go from there. 8. Compassion. Children need to develop and experience compassion. Kids need understanding and comforting. Regardless of whether you feel they’re right or wrong, their feelings, just like anyone’s, deserve validation. Can you provide these things? 9. A sense of humor. Your children will give you plenty of opportunities to laugh throughout their young lives with you. It would be a shame to allow those moments to go to waste. Trust me — you’ll keep your sanity if you have a sense of humor and let yourself laugh along the way. 10. Self-awareness. Children aren’t sure how to act. Again, it’s up to you to be a role model. You’ll find that kids react to situations in ways that mimic your reactions. Think about it — they don’t know any other way. Do you have enough self-awareness to determine whether you’re a good role model for your children? Parenting requires your utmost effort and attention. Successful kids most often have successful parents. Being a successful parent isn’t easy, but it’s easier if you build these attributes. You can develop these qualities with practice and determination. Do right by your child and enjoy the process of not being perfect, but good enough, which is often the best kind of parent. That’s true success!</p><p></p><p></p><br />
