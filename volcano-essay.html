Its surface is composed of many individual plates that move and interact, constantly changing and reshaping Earth's outer layer. Volcanoes and earthquakes both result from the movement of tectonic plates. In this interactive activity produced for Teachers' Domain with images from NASA, see the relationship between earthquakes and volcanoes and the boundaries of tectonic plates.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The taal volcano</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Taal has erupted in prehistoric times with enough violence to leave a crater many miles across and spew enough ash into the stratosphere to temporarily cool the entire planet.</p><p></p><p>Taal is a volcano within a volcano. The ash cloud and lava fountains are emerging from a crater on Volcano Island, a tourist destination that sits in the waters of Lake Taal. The well-defined escarpments rimming the lake reveal its true nature: It is a giant crater formed by massive eruptions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Lake Taal is similar to Crater Lake in Oregon and Yellowstone Lake in the heart of Yellowstone National Park. Each marks a caldera formed when an eruption many thousands of years ago caused the ground to collapse into evacuated magma chambers below.</p><p></p><p>Evacuation orders remain in place, and PHIVOLCS continues to warn that an explosive eruption could occur at any time. On Volcano Island proper, about 8,000 people have evacuated. There are no reports of fatalities.</p><p></p><p>Scientists have recorded 595 volcanic earthquakes since Sunday, including 30 over a 10-hour stretch Thursday, which “signifies continuous magmatic intrusion beneath the Taal edifice, which may lead to further eruptive activity,” PHIVOLCS reported.</p><p></p><p>There is no sign that Taal is about to blow in a catastrophic eruption, but the best predictor of a volcano’s future behavior is what it has done in the past, and Taal has erupted more than 30 times in five centuries.</p><p></p><p>On 1 July, a phreatomagmatic eruption (i.e. magma coming into contact with water) was recorded from the main crater of the Taal Volcano, approximately 70km south of central Manila.</p><br />

                        <strong>Essay about Geothermal Energy:</strong><p>Geothermal energy is the earth’s natural heat available inside the earth. This thermal energy contained in the rock and fluid that filled up fractures and pores in the earth’s crust can profitably be used for various purposes. Heat from the Earth, or geothermal — Geo (Earth) + thermal (heat) — energy can be and is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Geothermal resources range from shallow ground to hot water and rock several miles below the Earth’s surface, and even farther down to the extremely hot molten rock called magma. Mile-or-more-deep wells can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought to the surface for use in a variety of applications.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet, from radioactive decay of minerals, from volcanic activity and from solar energy absorbed at the surface. It has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but is now better known for generating electricity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Worldwide, about 10,715 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power is online in 24 countries. An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications.</p><p><strong>Study well mfaithsantiago! :)</strong></p><p><strong>Hope it helped!</strong></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            16. ESSAY.
How different types of volcano vary in appearance and eruption?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Volcanoes are natural phenomena that occur when molten rock, ash, and gas escape from the earth's crust. These geological formations come in different shapes and sizes, and their eruptions can range from peaceful to catastrophic. There are different types of volcanoes, each with unique characteristics that determine their appearance and eruption style. In this essay, we will discuss how different types of volcanoes vary in appearance and eruption.</p><p></p><p>The three main types of volcanoes are shield volcanoes, cinder cone volcanoes, and stratovolcanoes. Shield volcanoes are broad, gently sloping mountains formed by repeated lava flows. They are characterized by their low viscosity magma, which allows the lava to flow quickly and for long distances. Due to their broad base, shield volcanoes can be enormous and cover large areas. Examples of shield volcanoes include Mauna Loa in Hawaii and Galapagos Islands.</p><p></p><p>Cinder cone volcanoes are smaller than shield volcanoes and are usually only a few hundred meters high. They are formed by explosive eruptions that eject small pieces of lava into the air. As the lava falls back to the ground, it piles up around the vent, forming a cone-shaped mountain. Cinder cone volcanoes are typically found in clusters and can erupt several times over a short period. Examples of cinder cone volcanoes include Paricutin in Mexico and Sunset Crater in Arizona.</p><p></p><p>Stratovolcanoes, also known as composite volcanoes, are the most common type of volcano. They are tall, steep-sided mountains made of layers of ash, lava, and other volcanic debris. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are formed by explosive eruptions that can be very violent. These eruptions can cause pyroclastic flows, which are fast-moving avalanches of hot ash, rock, and gas. Mount St. Helens in Washington State and Mount Fuji in Japan are examples of stratovolcanoes.</p><p></p><p>In terms of eruption style, volcanoes can be classified as effusive or explosive. Effusive eruptions are gentle and non-explosive, with lava flowing out of the volcano's vent and spreading slowly over the surrounding area. Shield volcanoes are known for their effusive eruptions, which can last for days or even years. Explosive eruptions, on the other hand, are violent and destructive. They occur when magma rises rapidly to the surface and mixes with gases and other volatile substances, causing the eruption to be explosive. Stratovolcanoes and cinder cone volcanoes are known for their explosive eruptions, which can send ash and debris high into the atmosphere and cause widespread damage.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the appearance and eruption style of a volcano are determined by its type. Shield volcanoes are broad, gently sloping mountains formed by repeated lava flows and have effusive eruptions. Cinder cone volcanoes are smaller and formed by explosive eruptions, while stratovolcanoes are tall, steep-sided mountains made of layers of ash, lava, and other volcanic debris and have explosive eruptions. Understanding the characteristics of different types of volcanoes can help scientists predict their behavior and mitigate the potential damage caused by their eruptions.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Volcanoes are one of the most fascinating natural wonders on earth, but not all volcanoes are the same. There are different types of volcanoes, each with its unique appearance and eruption patterns. These differences are largely due to the type of magma, the location, and the underlying geological processes.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, let's consider the shield volcano. Shield volcanoes are typically broad and gently sloping with a convex shape, much like a warrior's shield. They are characterized by frequent and relatively gentle eruptions that produce fluid basaltic lava flows. These eruptions often create a caldera or depression at the summit of the volcano. Shield volcanoes are most commonly found at divergent plate boundaries or hotspots, such as Hawaii.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, stratovolcanoes or composite volcanoes are characterized by steep, conical shapes with a summit crater. These volcanoes are built up over time by layers of ash, lava, and other volcanic materials. The eruptions of stratovolcanoes are typically more explosive than shield volcanoes, producing ash, pumice, and other volcanic debris. They are often located at subduction zones, where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another.</p><p></p><p>Another type of volcano is the cinder cone, which is a small, steep-sided volcano that is composed of loose, fragmental volcanic material. Cinder cones are often found at the base of larger volcanoes and are typically only a few hundred meters high. They are formed by eruptions of small volumes of gas-rich lava that solidifies as it falls, creating the loose, cindery material that gives them their name.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there are supervolcanoes, which are massive volcanoes capable of producing the largest and most catastrophic eruptions on earth. These volcanoes are characterized by huge calderas, sometimes tens of kilometers in diameter, and can produce pyroclastic flows, ash clouds, and other destructive phenomena. Supervolcanoes are rare but can have devastating effects on the local and global environment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the different types of volcanoes vary significantly in their appearance and eruption patterns. Shield volcanoes are broad and gently sloping, with frequent and relatively gentle eruptions, while stratovolcanoes are steep and conical, with more explosive eruptions. Cinder cones are small and composed of loose, fragmental material, while supervolcanoes are massive and capable of producing catastrophic eruptions. Understanding these differences is critical for scientists and policymakers in predicting and preparing for volcanic activity and its potential impacts.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>-PA BRAINLIEST PO-</strong></p><p></p><br />

Heat from the earth's crust is being converted to energy.  The big advantages to this type of energy are that it is very clean and the resources are nearly inexhaustible.</p><p>http://library.thinkquest.org/17457/volcanoes/advantages.php</p><p> Fertile soil</p><p> When a volcano erupts it throws out a lot of ash.  At short notice this ash can be very harmful to the environment, but on the long term the ash layer, which contains many useful minerals, will be converted to a very fertile soil. Nearly everywhere volcanoes are located people use the rich soil for farming.  Even after an eruption people still return because of the fertile soil around the volcano.</p><p></p><p>http://library.thinkquest.org/17457/volcanoes/advantages.php</p><p></p> Tourism<p></p><p>Volcanoes attract millions of visitors every year, for different reasons. Around the volcano may be warm bathing lakes, hot springs, bubbling mud pools and steam vents. Tourism creates jobs in shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist centers / national parks.

                            19. essay about taal volcano​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Taal volcano with its lake-filled 15x20 km wide Talisay (Taal) caldera is a beautiful caldera volcano, but also one of the most active and dangerous volcanoes of the Philippines. Taal has had some of the country's largest and deadliest eruptions: At least 6 eruptions during the recorded history of Taal since 1572 claimed fatalities, mostly from powerful pyroclastic flows, as well as tsunamis produced in the crater lake.</p><p>Background:</p><p>The Taal caldera is largely filled by Lake Taal, whose 267 sq km surface lies only 3 m above sea level. The maximum depth of the lake is 160 m, and contains several eruptive centers submerged beneath the lake. All historic eruptions took place from the 5-km-wide volcanic island in the northern-central part of the lake.</p><p>The island is formed by overlapping stratovolcanoes, cinder cones and tuff rings (maars). Historic eruptions have seen the constant change and growth of the island.</p><p>Taal caused one of the worst volcano disasters in history: its eruption in 1911 killed 1334 people and caused ash fall as far as Manila city. Due to its devastating potential, Taal was declared one of the "Decade Volcanoes" in the Decade Volcanoes program of the 1990s in order to incentive study and monitoring of the volcano. Taal is today one of the most closely monitored volcanoes in the region. An increase in seismic activity under Taal was recorded in November 2006, followed by an increase in hot water springs in the crater in April 2007.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>TAAL VOLCANO, Philippines — The gray ash is knee-deep. It covers homes, trees and the bloated cadavers of cows and horses, their limbs protruding at unnatural angles in the shadow of a brooding volcano that could re-explode at any moment.</p><p></p><p>“My home is now gone,” said Melvin Mendoza, 39, a boatman who returned on Tuesday to Taal, the volcanic island in the middle of a freshwater lake just 40 miles south of Manila, which erupted on Sunday like an atomic bomb mushroom cloud.</p><p></p><p>The toxic ash and smoke, reeking of sulfur and other noxious gases, have transformed the verdant island, a popular tourist spot, into a vast carpet of lifeless gray.</p><p></p><p>At least 30,000 people in a nine-mile radius of surrounding towns have fled, and the United Nations says as many as a half-million residents remain at risk. For now, Taal is not habitable, and volcanologists say a new and perhaps more powerful eruption is possible.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Where plates come into contact, energy is released. Plates sliding past each other cause friction and heat. Subducting plates melt into the mantle, and diverging plates create new crust material. Subducting plates, where one tectonic plate is being driven under another, are associated with volcanoes and earthquakes.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Plate boundaries are the effect of the collision or detachment of plate from one another. And remember, everytime a plate there is movement of plates, one of the posibile affects are formation of volcanos. Regarding the earthquake, it happens because the plate can no longer hosd the frictiom between plates and so it snaps.</p><br />

Most volcanoes are distributed along the plate boundary. An example of a highly active earthquake zone is the west coast of North America and South America Occasionally, volcanoes are found in the middle of plates (e.g. Hawaii).The distribution of the volcanoes, earthquake epicenters, and major mountain belts are distributed in close proximity of the borders of the tectonic plates. Most of the active volcanoes nowadays are found at the so called ”Ring of Fire” which is practically the border of the Pacific Tectonic Plate.when the earthquake occurs the epicenter of the earthquake will develop mountain ranges Mountains Or the soil may go down the and become magma ; The magma melts and become a Lava which has been erupted by the volcano when the magma melts and the Volcano will erupt when the earth reaches its maximum temperature.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>ANSWER:</p><p>Volcanic eruptions are common, with more than 50 volcanic eruptions in the United States alone in the past 31 years. These eruptions can have devastating economic and social consequences, even at great distances from the volcano. Fortunately many eruptions are preceded by unrest that can be detected using ground, airborne, and spaceborne instruments. Data from these instruments, combined with basic understanding of how volcanoes work, form the basis for forecasting eruptions—where, when, how big, how long, and the consequences.</p><p></p><p>Accurate forecasts of the likelihood and magnitude of an eruption in a specified timeframe are rooted in a scientific understanding of the processes that govern the storage, ascent, and eruption of magma. Yet our understanding of volcanic systems is incomplete and biased by the limited number of volcanoes and eruption styles observed with advanced instrumentation. Volcanic Eruptions and Their Repose, Unrest, Precursors, and Timing identifies key science questions, research and observation priorities, and approaches for building a volcano science community capable of tackling them. This report presents goals for making major advances in volcano science.</p><p></p><p>EXPLANATION</p><p>kayu na lng po mag short nyan ang haba po kasi nahanap ko po yan so chrome</p><p></p><br />

I had never experienced anything like it before and it was a truly frightening and surreal experience. </p><p></p><p>Living in the Philippines, I was used to seeing Taal Volcano smoking and bubbling, but on that day, the activity was much more intense. I remember seeing thick ash clouds coming out of the volcano, and the sky had a deep orange hue as the sun was blocked out by all the ash. There were also loud rumbling noises coming from the volcano that made the ground shake and it felt like the earth was shaking beneath my feet. </p><p></p><p>The news about the eruption was all over the TV and the radio, and it was like living in a nightmare. Everyone was in a state of panic and fear, and many people were trying to find ways to evacuate. We decided to stay in our house, but the thought of the volcano erupting and the possibility of a massive eruption was terrifying. </p><p></p><p>The sense of helplessness and fear that I felt during the eruption of Taal Volcano is something that I will never forget. I felt so powerless and small compared to the immense power of nature and it was a humbling experience. I am thankful that the eruption was not as destructive as it could have been, and I hope that it never happens again.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>advantage: Volcanoes provide resources for energy extraction, also called geothermal resources.  Heat from the earth's crust is being converted to energy.  The big advantages to this type of energy are that it is very clean and the resources are nearly inexhaustible.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A volcano is an opening, in the planet’s surface which allows hot, molten rock, ash and gases to escape from below the surface.</p><p></p><p>The name, “volcano” originates from the name Vulcan, a god of fire in Roman mythology. Volcanoes are like giant safety valves that release the pressure that builds up inside the Earth. The Hawaii islands were formed by 5 volcanoes.</p><p></p><p>Classified by the extent of their activity volcanoes are of four types. An ‘active’ volcano is one that erupts regularly. There are about 500 known active volcanoes on Earth, not counting those that lie beneath the sea.</p><p></p>A ‘dormant’ volcano is one that has not erupted for many years, although there is still some activity deep inside it. An ‘extinct’ volcano is one which has ceased to be active.A volcanic eruption occurs when hot rocks and lava burst from a volcano; and geysers and springs are actually just volcanoes that throw boiling water high in the air. They are caused by volcanic heat warming trapped ground water.The liquid rocks inside a volcano are called magma and when it flows out it is called as lava. Fresh lava has temperatures from 700 degrees C to 1200’C and glows red-hot to white hot as it flows. The most dangerous volcanic eruption recorded is the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington.The tallest volcano in the world is the Ojos del Salado, a volcano in Chile. The world’s largest volcano is the Muano Loa in Hawaii.Volcanoes are generally concentrated on the edge of continents, along the island chain, or beneath the sea forming long mountain ranges. A major part of the world’s active volcanoes above sea level encircle the Pacific Ocean forming the “Ring of Fire.”Volcanoes can have serious affects on the lands and people around them when they erupt. The destruction they leave in their wake accounts for the total annihilation of the surrounding landscape. Around 2, 00,000 people have lost their lives to volcanic eruptions in the past five hundred years.Buildings are destroyed, people are rendered homeless, people are killed, plant and animal life are both destroyed and the poisonous gases that emanate from the volcanoes can cause death and diseases like pneumonia in the people who survive it.However not everything associated with the volcanoes is negative. The crust of the earth exists due tothe large volumes of magma that did not erupt but instead cooled below the surface. It results in rich soil which is good for cultivation.The volcanic ash that blows out of the volcano increases soil fertility by adding nutrients to the soil. Ground water heated by magma can be tapped for geothermal energy. Most of the metallic minerals like copper, gold, silver, lead and zinc are mined from the magmas found deep within the roots of extinct volcanoes.With the increasing studies done by scientists on volcanoes it is becoming possible to gauge the activity level of a volcano. With this information although it might not be possible to prevent the erupting of a volcano at least the massive destruction of lives can be avoided by getting people evacuated in time.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#CarryOnLearning#BrainlistAnswer#VerifiedAnswer<p></p><br />
