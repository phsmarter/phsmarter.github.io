Hard Questions
Entrepreneurs Answer for Society
• WHAT IS TO BE PRODUCED?
Since two-thirds of the total production of goods and services focus on the consumer sector, consumers comprise the group who determines what is to be produced.
• FOR WHOM IS IT TO BE PRODUCED?
In the economy, the “For Whom” question is generally defined as whoever has the most money to buy the items which are made from the factors of production. Generally speaking, the people with the most money are those who own a successful business (consumers want their goods and services) and/or those who are in occupations in high demand (businesses want their skills).
• HOW WILL IT BE PRODUCED?
This is determined with the consumer in mind, primarily through the interaction of businesses and consumers. For example, the Rolls Royce is a luxurious car made with high expenses and lasts a long time. Many consumers however cannot afford a Rolls Royce. Entrepreneurs note this point and produce less exclusive cars at a lower price in order to satisfy the needs and wants of those who cannot afford a Rolls.
In addressing these questions, it is important to point out how the market operates in each one. For example, if consumers do not buy certain items which are produced, this is a signal to business to stop producing them (what is to be produced). If consumers will not pay the price for an item even though it is of high quality, producers might have to find ways to use other technologies for the item in order to make it less expensive (how to produce). Those people who choose to enter occupations or establish businesses which produce goods and services that are in big demand will get more of the output (for whom).</a>

For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</a>

Hard Questions
Entrepreneurs Answer for Society
• WHAT IS TO BE PRODUCED?
Since two-thirds of the total production of goods and services focus on the consumer sector, consumers comprise the group who determines what is to be produced.
• FOR WHOM IS IT TO BE PRODUCED?
In the economy, the “For Whom” question is generally defined as whoever has the most money to buy the items which are made from the factors of production. Generally speaking, the people with the most money are those who own a successful business (consumers want their goods and services) and/or those who are in occupations in high demand (businesses want their skills).
• HOW WILL IT BE PRODUCED?
This is determined with the consumer in mind, primarily through the interaction of businesses and consumers. For example, the Rolls Royce is a luxurious car made with high expenses and lasts a long time. Many consumers however cannot afford a Rolls Royce. Entrepreneurs note this point and produce less exclusive cars at a lower price in order to satisfy the needs and wants of those who cannot afford a Rolls.
In addressing these questions, it is important to point out how the market operates in each one. For example, if consumers do not buy certain items which are produced, this is a signal to business to stop producing them (what is to be produced). If consumers will not pay the price for an item even though it is of high quality, producers might have to find ways to use other technologies for the item in order to make it less expensive (how to produce). Those people who choose to enter occupations or establish businesses which produce goods and services that are in big demand will get more of the output (for whom).</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.What is to be produced?</p><p>The production of goods and services is determined by the consumers who want and need them.</p><p></p><p>2.For whom is it to be produced?</p><p>The "for whom" question in the economy is typically determined by those who have the most money to purchase the goods and services produced, which are often successful businesses or those in high demand occupations.</p><p></p><p>3.How will it be produced?</p><p>The production process is determined with the consumer in mind, through the interaction of businesses and consumers. Entrepreneurs consider factors such as cost and consumer demand in order to produce goods and services that satisfy the needs and wants of consumers.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</h2><br />

Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</h2><br />
