                                            Hazard
My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came in on Mary
First time someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
Saw the man inside
[Chorus 1]
We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walked along the river
And dream our way out of this town
[Verse 2]
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning 
Here I was surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly pointed right at me
[Chorus 2]
I swear I left by the river 
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town
[Bridge]
I think about life gone by
How it’s done me wrong
There’s no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone
[Chorus 2]
I swear I left by the river 
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town</a>

and doesn't want to snap at people. He is easily startled by noise
and motion. He describes having intrusive memories about his
traumatic experiences on a daily basis but he declines to share any
details. He also avoids seeing friends because seeing them reminds
him of experiences that he does not want to remember.

                                            THE LEGEND OF THE SUGARCANE Once upon a time, there lived an old datu (chieftain). One day, he prayed to Bathala (God) saying, “I am getting older and weaker every day. As to my life here on earth, I find it increasingly boring to live on. Please allow me to ascend to heaven earlier!” Suddenly a voice said, “But your time on earth is not yet over.” The datu felt a little disappointed at this and left the palace, then went alone for a walk around the forest. Suddenly an old man came up to him. Knowing the grievance in his heart, the old man tried to cheer him up by saying, “It might surprise you to know, my Lord, that we can already find heaven on earth!” With that remark, he led the datu to a place where there grew a king plant that has a long tall body, with long leaves that looks very much like bamboo.” He went on to say, “This is a heavenly plant, try tasting its stem, it’s incredibly sweet.” The datu started to chew its stem and found it indeed to be very sweet. He really felt as if he’s gone to heaven. He also learned from the old man that the tall shoots are called tubo. The datu thanked the old man and took a sample of the purple-colored stalks home with him. From that time on, he ordered his people to plant more of this tubo, which we know it today as sugarcane which is still chewed or squeezed into cold drinks, or refined into brown and white sugar. COMPREHENSION CHECK: 1. What is the setting of the story? 2. Who is Datu in a certain tribe? 3. How does the datu feel about his life? 4. How does the old man cher up the datu? 5. What makes the tubo a heavenly plant?​</a>

closer, Kelly grew pleased that she was still sitting alone. "Maybe I'll get the whole

"We must do something about father," said theson. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating,and food on the floor." So the husband and wife set asmall table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alonewhile the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. SinceGrandfather had broken a dish or two, his food wasserved in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced inGrandfather's direction, sometimes he had a tear in hiseye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple hadfor him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a forkor spilled food.The four-year-old watched it all in silence.One evening before supper, the father noticed his sonplaying with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the childsweetly, "What are you making?" Just as sweetly, theboy responded, "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you andMama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.The words so struck the parents so that they werespeechless. Then tears started to stream down theircheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew whatmust be done.That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand andgently led him back to the family table. For the remainderof his day, he ate every meal with the family. And forsome reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to careany longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or thetablecloth soiled.QUESTIONS:1.

The choices are:
Ye hearers, take it of worth, old and young,
And forsake Pride, for he deceiveth you in the end.
And remember Beauty, Five-Wits, Strength, and Discretion
They all at the last do Everyman forsake,
But beware, for and they be small,…
For after death amends may no man make,
For then mercy and pity doth him forsake.

My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came in on Mary
First time someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
Saw the man inside
[Chorus 1]
We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walked along the river
And dream our way out of this town
[Verse 2]
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning 
Here I was surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly pointed right at me
[Chorus 2]
I swear I left by the river 
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town
[Bridge]
I think about life gone by
How it’s done me wrong
There’s no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone
[Chorus 2]
I swear I left by the river 
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town</h2><br />

                            19. THE LEGEND OF THE SUGARCANE Once upon a time, there lived an old datu (chieftain). One day, he prayed to Bathala (God) saying, “I am getting older and weaker every day. As to my life here on earth, I find it increasingly boring to live on. Please allow me to ascend to heaven earlier!” Suddenly a voice said, “But your time on earth is not yet over.” The datu felt a little disappointed at this and left the palace, then went alone for a walk around the forest. Suddenly an old man came up to him. Knowing the grievance in his heart, the old man tried to cheer him up by saying, “It might surprise you to know, my Lord, that we can already find heaven on earth!” With that remark, he led the datu to a place where there grew a king plant that has a long tall body, with long leaves that looks very much like bamboo.” He went on to say, “This is a heavenly plant, try tasting its stem, it’s incredibly sweet.” The datu started to chew its stem and found it indeed to be very sweet. He really felt as if he’s gone to heaven. He also learned from the old man that the tall shoots are called tubo. The datu thanked the old man and took a sample of the purple-colored stalks home with him. From that time on, he ordered his people to plant more of this tubo, which we know it today as sugarcane which is still chewed or squeezed into cold drinks, or refined into brown and white sugar. COMPREHENSION CHECK: 1. What is the setting of the story? 2. Who is Datu in a certain tribe? 3. How does the datu feel about his life? 4. How does the old man cher up the datu? 5.

                            22. The Wooden BowlA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law,and four-year-old grandson. The old man's handstrembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered.The family ate together at the table. But the elderlygrandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eatingdifficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. Whenhe grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with themess. "We must do something about father," said theson. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating,and food on the floor." So the husband and wife set asmall table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alonewhile the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. SinceGrandfather had broken a dish or two, his food wasserved in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced inGrandfather's direction, sometimes he had a tear in hiseye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple hadfor him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a forkor spilled food.The four-year-old watched it all in silence.One evening before supper, the father noticed his sonplaying with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the childsweetly, "What are you making?" Just as sweetly, theboy responded, "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you andMama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.The words so struck the parents so that they werespeechless. Then tears started to stream down theircheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew whatmust be done.That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand andgently led him back to the family table. For the remainderof his day, he ate every meal with the family. And forsome reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to careany longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or thetablecloth soiled.QUESTIONS:1. If you were the old man in the story, how will you feelon how your son treat you?2. How should you treat your parents or elders in thefamily?3. What does this story teach you? pa answer po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.)</strong><strong> </strong>I would feel hurt, if my son treats me unfairly and I did not deserve it.  He should not be doing that to me because I am an old man, who needs love and care at my old age.  A young man who does not understand or appreciate me, might have to bear the same consequences when he is old as well.  His son might be treating him in the same way, and he might regret how poorly he had treated me when he gets old too.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.)</strong> You should treat your parents or elders in the family kindly and with respect. They are the foundation to the family's stability, and their wisdom can be passed down to you and benefit your life greatly. It is common for a child to treat his or her elders unfairly because the child does not know any better.  But the adult should understand the value of their family members, and should treat them kindly and with respect.  Kindness and respect are very effective tools for maintaining the peace in a family.  They are essential for all relationships, not just the ones with elders.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>This story teaches me to treat my elders with respect and kindness.  It also teaches me that even the smallest of deeds can have the biggest impact.  If I treat my elders with respect, it might inspire them to treat me with respect as well.  We never know how our actions might affect others, so it is important to be respectful whenever possible. Also, being kind to others can make us feel good about ourselves.</p><br />

The choices are:
Ye hearers, take it of worth, old and young,
And forsake Pride, for he deceiveth you in the end.
And remember Beauty, Five-Wits, Strength, and Discretion
They all at the last do Everyman forsake,
But beware, for and they be small,…
For after death amends may no man make,
For then mercy and pity doth him forsake.
