If the researcher is looking for features that the students use, features they would like to see, and the price that they are willing to pay, an in-depth research study has to be conducted</p><p></p><p>- <strong>Scope and delimitation:</strong><strong> </strong>This step is imperative to understand the features that need development, the features that require an upgraded, pricing of the device, and the go-to-market strategy.</p><p></p><p>- <strong>Significant of the study:</strong> In 2016/17 alone, there were 24.7 million students enrolled in universities across the US. It is impossible to research all of these students; the time spent would create the new device redundant, and the money spent on development would render the study useless. Creating a sample of universities by geographical location and further creating a sample of these students from these universities provides a large enough number of students for research.</p><br />
