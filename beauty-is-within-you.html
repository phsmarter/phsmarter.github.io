                                            3. Citizens of the Fairlawn Park area look with alarm at the diabolical plot to change a beautiful spot into a baseball park. If this malicious plan is carried out the lovely trees will be cut down. Values of the property within the area will drop sharply as the park fills with filth and debris of the bulldozers and other equipment. Later the shrieks of the young ruffians who take over the park will destroy the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. Obviously no one cares about the poor citizens who has slaved to pay for his home and to keep up with his taxes. https://www.mdc.edu-kendall A. What is the author's stand about the changes in the Fairlawn Park area? B. Cite words or phrases in the paragraph that reveal the author's biases. C.

                                            Activity 2: Changing MindsetThere are times wherein we try to give a different understanding to what we read especially if we have different perceptions about its message. In this activity you need to transpose a statement in its opposite tone. Try to make three positive sentences out of the text below. It took me a long time to realize that not everything in life is meant to be a beautiful story. Not every person we feel something deep and moving with is meant to make a home within is, is meant to be a forever. Sometimes, people come into our lives to teach us how to love; and sometimes, people come into our lives to teach us how not to love. How not to settle, how not to shrink ourselves ever again. Yes, sometimes people leave – but it’s okay because their lessons always stay, that is what matters. That is what matters.- Bianca Sparacino</a>

                                            I’m very ugly
So don’t try to convince me that
I am a very beautiful person
Because at the end of the day
I hate myself in every single way
And I’m not going to lie to myself by saying
There is beauty inside of me that matters
That I am a worthless, terrible person
And nothing you say will make me believe
I still deserve love
Because no matter what
I am not good enough to be loved
And I am in no position to believe that
Beauty does exist within me
Because whenever I look in the mirror I always think
Am I as ugly as people say?

The vehicles that bring you to different beautiful places are also made from those minerals that came within our planet. Through mining, common types of different minerals and rocks are unleashed and found such as copper, zinc, nickel, iron, brick, limestone, and so on. Somehow, this activity helps our country's economy by providing the resource industry to ease our everyday lives. On the other hand, too much mining can also cause negative effects on our health and the environment. Some people abuse the gift of our planet and overly exploit our natural resources through mining.

They have been looking outside through thier phones, comparing themselves with other people, when in fact they haven't really looked inside yet. They haven't observed, and appreciated thie strenghts, thier power, their weaknesses, (and) what things they have to improve on. They have been focused on molding themselves into packages of beauty and standards and hypes. I think they have to be more aware of themselves. They have to look deep within them and find a motivation.   (Billie Hakenson's Preliminary Interview in Miss Universe Philippines 2020)OBSERVATIONSFLUENCY TONEWORD CHOICE CORRECTNESS​</a>

Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don't work... Use more gun. Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil' old number designed by me, built by me, and you best hope... Not pointed at you.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.	Identify and write the line in the poem where the author makes
</p><p>comparison with flowers?
</p><p>
</p><p>Answer:  Helen, thy beauty is to me  </p><p>Like those Nice'an barks of yore,
</p><p>-This line is like flowers whenever you see it, its makes beauty and nice to your eyes.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.Who do you think is the wanderer in the last two lines of the first stanza?
</p><p>Answer: It’s Helen.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.What does the author trying to imply in these lines:
</p><p>Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
</p><p>Low statue-like I see thee stand,
</p><p>
</p><p>•	Answer: The speaker is floored by Helen's beauty as he sees her standing in the "window niche" (like a nook). Saying "Lo" is like saying OMG when you all of a sudden see something astonishing. Helen is standing "statue-like," which means both that she resembles a work of art and that she is not moving at all.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4.What is the tone of the poem as expressed by the author?
</p><p>Answer: The tone of the poem is written in admiration in a heavenly and dreamy language towards the stellar features of the legendary Helen of Troy set in the picturesque ancient Greek where various aspects of creativity and theory developed. It also shows the underlying love Poe has for his first lady, Jane Stanard.
</p><p>
</p><p>5.Was the life of the author shown in the poem? In what way?
</p><p>Answer: Yes, it has shown there through his stanzas you could tell how he described Helen and how their lives together as well as his life being with Helen.

It took me a long time to realize that not everything in life is meant to be a beautiful story. Not every person we feel something deep and moving with is meant to make a home within is, is meant to be a forever. Sometimes, people come into our lives to teach us how to love; and sometimes, people come into our lives to teach us how not to love. How not to settle, how not to shrink ourselves ever again.

I am not good enough to be loved
And I am in no position to believe that

Am I as ugly as people say?

They have been looking outside through thier phones, comparing themselves with other people, when in fact they haven't really looked inside yet. They haven't observed, and appreciated thie strenghts, thier power, their weaknesses, (and) what things they have to improve on. They have been focused on molding themselves into packages of beauty and standards and hypes. I think they have to be more aware of themselves. They have to look deep within them and find a motivation.   (Billie Hakenson's Preliminary Interview in Miss Universe Philippines 2020)OBSERVATIONSFLUENCY TONEWORD CHOICE CORRECTNESS​</h2><br />
