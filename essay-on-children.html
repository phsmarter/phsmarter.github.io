                        Children and young people have the same general human rights as adults and also specific rights that recognize their special needs. The Convention recognizes the fundamental human dignity of all children and the urgency of ensuring their well-being and development. Children's rights are the human rights of children with particular attention to the rights of special protection and care afforded to minors, including their right to association with both parents, human identity as well as the basic needs for food, universal state-paid education, health care and criminal laws. Main children’s right are Life, survival and development. Protection from violence, abuse or neglect. An education that enables children to fulfil their potential. Every children have right to food, housing, proper medical care, education and freedom as per UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child.

Give me an 3 paragraph essay about “The children are the fair hope of the future”</h2><br />
                        <p>"The <strong>children</strong> are the <strong>fair hope</strong> of the<strong> future</strong>", said all the elderly people. I think this saying holds a strong meaning but it is so sad that it can only stay as a saying. They would keep on telling the youth that they possess great power in reshaping the future yet nobody ever listens to the young ones. Why? Is it because we haven't experienced what you had? Or is it because the elderly knows best?</p><p></p><p>I believe <strong>society</strong> does not understand how <strong>ironic</strong> the quote can be. Many of the youths go on the streets to fight for freedom, point out the wrongdoings of the greedy, or even do some charity. The strength and motivation that they show always go in vain. I think it's time that we break the cycle of <strong>seniority</strong>. All of us are given a pair of ears from birth. That only means that everybody should listen to each other no matter their age. </p><p></p><p>I hope there would come a time when people acknowledge the truth and what is right upon hearing it. It's tiring how lots of people would twist the truth just because of pride. This is the main reason why it is tiring to become a younger person. I wish generational trauma ends but this needs the cooperation of those with close minds and eccentricity. If society hopes for the children to change the future, I hope the elderly start changing as well.</p><p></p><p>If you would like to learn more about essays, kindly please take your time to visit this link:https://brainly.ph/question/10045947</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Child abandonment is the process of surrendering interests and claims over one's child(ren) with the goal of never another time resuming or reasserting it. There are a lot of causes to child abandonment and they may include social and cultural factors. Poverty has been mentioned time and again as the root cause of child abandonment. People living in cultures with poor social welfare systems and are financially incapable of taking care of their child(ren) are more likely than not to abandon (Bourdieu, 5). The socio-economic factors and relationships also contribute to the abandoning of children.Other factors that in one way or another contribute to this misfortune include political conditions, such as complicated adoption proceedings, the lack of organizations such as orphanages, to take in children have been abandoned. Social groups with strong structures and liberal laws on adoption are likely to have lower rates of child abandonment. Poverty is described as the lack of basic human needs, these include but not limited to clean water, food, medical care, clothing, shelter and education. This is mainly caused by the inability to afford them because of meager financial resources or their unavailability."Aguantando" is a Spanish word that denotes holding on. It can be loosely translated to "barely surviving" depicting a life full of misery. The story is set in the Dominican Republic and we can easily tell that the conditions the family lives in are that of absolute poverty. This is due to the fact that the only person monetarily upholding the family is the mother and who is unable to provide for the family. The small boy,Yunior, throughout the whole story bemoans how poor they were "We didn't eat rocks but we didn't eat meat or beans either. Almost everything on our plates was boiled: boiled yuca, boiled platano, maybe with a piece of cheese or a shred of bacalao." (Diaz 70).For a long time now, the Dominican Republic has been recognized as a major producer of yucca and banana [plátano] the world over. It is very cheap to get it from the local market but due to the conditions of its handling, they become unsafe as well unhygienic with the consequences being the "annual case of worms" (Diaz 71). The story plays out in a sequence of happenings that come to be associated around the central issue of the missing father. The speaker notes at the commencement that he hasn't had a father for many years, yet the idea of the father clearly affects him grea</p><br />

Children with speech and language problems are using technology to advance further with programs such as LENA.Children to day have no choice but to be somehow influenced by technology.

                            15. Make an Argumentative Essay: Should Children Be Vaccinated?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Vaccination is a critical aspect of modern medicine that has contributed to saving many lives and controlling the spread of illnesses. Despite this, there is a growing group of people who oppose vaccination and question its safety and effectiveness. The debate of whether children should be vaccinated is complex and divisive, but the answer is straightforward: children should receive vaccines.</p><p></p><p>First, vaccines are secure and efficient. Numerous studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that vaccines are a safe and effective method of controlling infectious diseases. Organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) concur that vaccines are safe and have undergone thorough testing for their safety and effectiveness. Additionally, the safety of vaccines is continually monitored through surveillance systems and reporting of adverse events, allowing for rapid identification and resolution of any issues with vaccines.</p><p></p><p>Second, vaccinating children protects vulnerable groups. When a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, making it more challenging for diseases to spread. This is especially important for individuals who cannot receive vaccines, such as newborns, elderly people, and those with certain medical conditions. By protecting these vulnerable groups, vaccinating children ensures that everyone has access to the protection that vaccines offer.</p><p></p><p>Third, not vaccinating children puts them and others in danger. Diseases that were once widespread and deadly, like measles and polio, can re-emerge as a threat if enough people stop getting vaccinated. This is already happening in some areas, with outbreaks of preventable diseases becoming increasingly frequent. Not only does this put unvaccinated individuals at risk, but it also increases the danger to vulnerable populations who cannot receive vaccines.</p><p></p><p>Finally, vaccinating children is a moral duty. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from harm, and vaccines provide a safe and effective way to do so. By choosing not to vaccinate their children, parents are not only putting their own children at risk, but they are also putting others in their community in danger. Furthermore, vaccination ensures that future generations continue to have access to the protection that vaccines offer, preserving the progress made against preventable diseases.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, vaccinating children is essential. Vaccines are safe and effective, protect vulnerable populations, prevent the spread of diseases, and are a moral obligation. By vaccinating children, we can help ensure a healthier and safer future for everyone.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Vaccination has been a controversial topic for decades, with some individuals advocating for its benefits while others raise concerns about its safety. The question of whether children should be vaccinated has been the subject of numerous debates and discussions, with many parents questioning its necessity. In this essay, I will argue that children should indeed be vaccinated to protect their health and the health of others.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph 1: Protection against deadly diseases</p><p></p><p>One of the most compelling reasons to vaccinate children is to protect them against deadly diseases. The availability of vaccines has made it possible to eradicate many dangerous diseases that once claimed thousands of lives, such as smallpox and polio. By vaccinating children, parents can help ensure that their children are protected from diseases that could cause severe harm or even death. Furthermore, vaccines also provide protection against diseases that can cause serious long-term health problems, such as meningitis and chickenpox.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph 2: Community protection</p><p></p><p>Vaccination not only protects individuals, but it also protects the wider community. When a large number of people are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, which makes it difficult for a disease to spread. This helps to protect those who are unable to receive vaccines, such as individuals with weakened immune systems, as well as newborns who are too young to receive certain vaccines.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph 3: Safety and efficacy of vaccines</p><p></p><p>Another common concern among parents is the safety and efficacy of vaccines. However, the vast majority of scientific evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. In fact, vaccines are thoroughly tested and monitored by various agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to ensure their safety. Additionally, vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing the spread of diseases and reducing their severity.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, vaccinating children is a crucial step in protecting their health and the health of others. By receiving vaccines, children can be protected against deadly diseases, and by creating herd immunity, the wider community can also be protected. Moreover, the safety and efficacy of vaccines have been well established, making them a safe and effective way to protect children against diseases. It is important that parents understand the benefits of vaccination and take the necessary steps to ensure that their children are properly protected.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>We are the children of stardust. Every atom in our bodies was once part of a star that exploded. We are made of the same stuff as the stars.</p><p></p><p>Stars are born when huge clouds of gas and dust collapse under their own gravity. The cores of these collapsing clouds become incredibly hot and dense, igniting nuclear fusion reactions. These reactions fuse hydrogen atoms into helium, releasing massive amounts of energy in the form of light and heat.</p><p></p><p>Over time, stars like our Sun use up all their fuel and begin to die. They expand into giant red giants, then collapse into white dwarf stars or neutron stars before finally exploding as supernovas. All this matter is scattered across space where it eventually forms new stars, planets, and even life itself</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Foreign education can have a significant impact on a child's success in several ways. Firstly, children who receive a foreign education often develop a broader perspective and understanding of different cultures, languages, and ways of thinking. This exposure can help them develop a more open-minded and tolerant attitude towards others, which is beneficial in today's globalized world.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, foreign education can provide access to a higher quality of education and specialized fields of study, which may not be available in the child's home country. This exposure can enable children to develop unique skills and knowledge, making them more competitive in the global job market.</p><p></p><p>However, foreign education can also present some challenges for children, such as language barriers, cultural adjustment issues, and homesickness. These challenges can be significant, and they may affect a child's academic performance and overall well-being.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the impact of foreign education on a child's success depends on several factors, including the quality of education, the child's willingness to adapt, and the support provided by the child's family and school. When given the right support and resources, foreign education can provide children with valuable skills and experiences that can help them succeed in their future endeavors.</p><p></p><strong>Hope this helps &lt;3</strong><p></p><br />

                            24.  essay about the love and sacrifices of parents to their children​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A couple's life is based around their little bundle of joy after becoming a mum. A pair turns into a mother and father and what was there before "us" is now "our baby." Parents devote their lifetime actively or implicitly dedicating their time to their offspring. It's also difficult to relax after a long day at work, because little child looks forward to spending the whole day playing with parents. The 'me period' is still out of the parent's calendar. </p><p>This is one of the greatest sacrifice anyone makes as a dad. Emotional Quotient(EQ) is more critical than Knowledge Quotient(IQ) (IQ). A individual who is emotionally secure is happier than someone who is not. Our parents will change their lives for us, but their mental stability will be affected. Some people and occasions are providing emotional comfort in their lives. Yet they can't meet much because of parental obligations. The mental wellbeing of these sacrifices disturb.</p><p></p><p>Our parents should not have to pay for their good deeds because of my interpretation. I guess what makes them proud is that we become upright and accountable people who can take care of themselves. I agree that this will be the perfect way to reward them. Our affectionate parents are old, they are powerless at some stage, and we are going to return favorites and look after them. It is our duty to support us and to fulfill your needs that our parents and guardians raised us up right. Parents expend money to meet all childhood needs. They deliver the best possible education and even go outside their means to offer children better chances. Their investment plans pay a high price for these compromises. Even the great Indian marriage costs a lot for emptying your pockets. If it is a girl parents go so far as to take old-age loans to marry their girl, often with a dowry. A son should share his parents' financial obligations when he is old. But if the son doesn’t earn it is worse for parents in their old age.</p><p></p><p>Parents have unconditional childhood love. With old age, parents become our children and need love and caring. Do not forget, a parent never retires. In today's world, maybe their words of wisdom do not hold significance, but knowledge is the greatest teacher. With all the sacrifices, if a parent has no love and affection, imagine the trauma they're going to experience. The planet is getting smaller, and to grow professionally, we need to travel locations. We don't have to drag our elders around during their old age. It is more than important for them to be proud of their upbringing, just sincere affection and being there when they need us. There's a feeling I'm going to say. It's really real for me, as a daughter, and now as a mum. </p><p></p><p>"The more parenting I go through, the more parents I owe an apology to."</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>         Argumentative essay television couses an increase in violence in children. Television has been proven to be one of the leading causes of increased levels of violence in children. Studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between the amount of time spent watching television and the level of aggressive behavior exhibited by children. The more time children spend glued to the television screen, the more likely they are to engage in acts of violence.There are a number of reasons why this is so. First, televised violence provides children with a model for aggression and teaches them that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflict. Second, as they watch violent programs, kids become less sensitive to real-world brutality and may come to see aggression as normal behavior. Finally, extended exposure to TVviolence desensitizes young viewers and makes them more likelyto behave aggressively themselves . In lightof these findings , it’s clear that parents need topay close attentionto what their kids are watching on TV and limit their exposure to programs with high levels of violence.</p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>essay </strong><strong>form </strong><strong>na </strong><strong>you </strong><strong>can </strong><strong>copy </strong><strong>it.</strong><strong>HOPE </strong><strong>IT </strong><strong>HELPS</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Children do not learn through what parents preach but children learn through the action of their parents. Therefore, parents must be very careful about what they do to their children and how they behave in front of them.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Criticism He/She Learns to Condemn</strong></p><p>Criticism can have a very bad effect on the growth, development, and thinking of children. Parents cannot even imagine how bad its effects could be. It affects their overall personality. As children absorb everything that they are told during the early childhood years very easily, the criticism may seep deep inside them. What they hear in form of criticism may become their actual personality and surely will come out in form of condemnation from them.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Hostility He/She Learns to Fight</strong></p><p>A loving and caring atmosphere is what children need to grow up into well-balanced individuals. If they are surrounded with hostility, they may not be able to develop the qualities like empathy, friendliness, and a caring attitude. Hostility will make children aggressive and they will learn to fight without thinking about what is right and what is wrong.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Ridicule He/She Learns to be Shy</strong></p><p>If children are constantly subjected to ridicule their self-esteem and confidence are crushed. Lack of self-esteem and confidence will give rise to shyness in them. If children become shy and introverted, they may face a lot of difficulties while walking the path of success in life.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Shame He/She Learns to Feel Guilty</strong></p><p>Children are innocent; they do not know the difference between right and wrong. Due to constant shaming, they will develop guilt which will never let them live peacefully. Guilt may be responsible for stress and tension in them which may also affect their health.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Tolerance He/She Learns to be Patient</strong></p><p>Patience is a very important trait that every parent must develop in their children. It is possible to foster patience in children only if parents show tolerance. It does not mean that giving in to their unreasonable demands. It means that parents should not get hyper when children make any mistake or behave badly. They must provide the right guidance by being calm and showing tolerance.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Encouragement He/She Learns Confidence</strong></p><p>Encouragement from parents is very important for children to succeed in life. Parents can play an important role in encouraging children and boosting their confidence.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Praise He/She Learns to Appreciate</strong></p><p>Praising children for the right things and at right time can help them learn to appreciate the good deeds and hard work of others. If they are praised for good behavior or their hard work they will repeat the same behavior for earning your praise.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Fairness He/She Learns Justice</strong></p><p>If you practice fairness with your child and if you teach your child to be fair, he will never be unjust to others throughout his life.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Security He/She Learns to Have Faith</strong></p><p>When you always stand by your child, he will develop a sense of security. In the future when he has to take any important decision or if he is in distress he will surely have faith in you. He will have faith that you have solutions to all his problems.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Approval He/She Learns to Like Himself/Herself</strong></p><p>Let your child follow his dreams. Do not burden him with your expectations. Never force him to do something in life to satisfy your ego. Only then your child can live his life to the fullest and learn to like himself.</p><p></p><p><strong>If a Child Lives with Acceptance and Friendship He/She Learns to Find Love in the World</strong></p><p>Shower your unconditional love on your child. Be there for him always. Celebrate his every little achievement. Teach good values to him and accept him for, however, he is. Do not compare him with other children. Let him grow in your love and care.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
