THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
Robet Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, Long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
The where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Structuralism is a literary theory that focuses on the underlying structures of a text and how those structures shape the meaning of the text. In analyzing "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost using structuralism, we can identify several key elements:</p><p></p><p>Binary oppositions: The poem sets up a series of binary oppositions, including two roads, two travelers, two claims, and two paths through life.</p><p>Metaphor: The two roads are a metaphor for the choices that we make in life, and the traveler's decision to take the "road less traveled" is a metaphor for taking a unique and unconventional path through life.</p><p>Form: The poem is structured into five stanzas of equal length, each with four lines. The first and third lines of each stanza rhyme, as do the second and fourth lines. This structure creates a sense of balance and symmetry in the poem.</p><p>Using these structural elements as a starting point, we can identify a real-life situation and an application of the value learned from the poem, as shown in the table below:</p><p>----------------------------</p><p></p><p>In the context of choosing a career path, "The Road Not Taken" can be seen as a metaphor for the importance of taking risks and following one's own unique path. The poem suggests that there is value in exploring the less-traveled roads of life, even if they are not always easy or well-worn. By taking a chance and pursuing an unconventional career path, for example, one might discover new opportunities and experiences that would not have been possible otherwise.</p><p></p><p>The value learned from the poem is the importance of making one's own choices in life, and the courage to take risks and explore new paths. By following one's own path, even if it is not the most popular or well-trodden, one can find fulfillment and meaning in life.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1. In the last two lines of the poem the poet tells that the road he opted for is less travelled.</p><p>2. You can use lines to convey movement and create texture. Lines provide emphasis and define shape. They can be used to convey mood and emotion.</p><p>3. ( I dont know )</p><p>4. It means that it is the limitation of a human being that one person can not take two paths even if both looks attractive so a choice has to be made. So, the poet says that I could not travel both.</p><p>5. The diverging roads may be read as being an extended metaphor for two kinds of life choices in general: the conventional versus the unconventional. By choosing the less-traveled path over the well-traveled path, the speaker suggests that he or she values individualism over conformity</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Yan beh sana makatulong sayo</p><br />

THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
Robet Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, Long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
The where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Just like life, the world can be just as unpredictable, especially when it comes to the choices you make. The world, as of right now, have many things going on; you never know what will happen next. You can speculate, but it is never 100% guaranteed. When you go down a road you have chosen, it can still very much change, it's unpredictable; things don't always go as planned. Whether we like it or not, we cannot travel both roads; yet, they're similar in the aspects of unpredictability. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

 Does the quote imply choice?or freedom?Why an How?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The speaker, when trying to choose which road to take, looks for the road that seems less worn. At the end of the poem, the speaker asserts that choosing the road less traveled "has made all the difference"—the suggestion being that he or she has led a life of nonconformity, and is happier because of it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>carry on learning</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The two roads diverged into a fork in the road, meaning that the roads went in two separate directions. The “yellow wood” means the poem is set in autumn. This also means there were leaves on the ground that might have obscured tracks in the roads. The speaker has come to two roads in a wood.</p><p></p><p>The phrase, “the road less traveled” is said to have its initial traces in Robert Frost's Poem, “The Road Not Taken” published in 1920. Although the phrase has not been used in an exact way, the metaphoric use of the phrase conveys the same sense.</p><p></p><p>Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images. Robert Frost wrote “The Road Not Taken” as a joke for a friend, the poet Edward Thomas. When they went walking together, Thomas was chronically indecisive about which road they ought to take and—in retrospect—often lamented that they should, in fact, have taken the other one.</p><p></p><p>The two roads symbolize the choices that one has to make in life. It is very important to make the right choice because we can never retrace our path and go back. One road would lead on to another and there is no coming back.</p><p></p><p>(i) a yellow wood: The yellow woods represents the season of autumn. Autumn also stands for old age and inactivity. The poet could be symbolically talking about his later stages of life when he finds it hard to take a decision.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>PA</strong><strong> </strong><strong>BRAINLIEST</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PLSS</strong></p><br />

In your point of view, do you think the speaker of the poem is happy about his choice? Why or Why not?(IN YOUR OWN OPINION)​</h2><br />
                        <p>In the poem, the speaker describes coming to a fork in the road and having to choose between two paths. He chooses the less-traveled path, saying that it has made all the difference in his life. The poem is often interpreted as a celebration of individualism and non-conformity, as the speaker chooses to take the road less traveled, even though it may have been riskier or less popular.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the question of whether the speaker is happy about his choice, the poem's ambiguity leaves this open to interpretation. On the one hand, the speaker seems to take pride in his decision to take the less-traveled path, saying that it "has made all the difference" in his life. On the other hand, the speaker also acknowledges that he may never come back to this point in the road and be able to take the other path. This could suggest regret or uncertainty about the choice he made.</p><p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />

                            26. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

                        <p><strong>Answer: (Those in parentheses are meanings of each line)</strong></p><p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, (<strong>the narrator walks through a forest turned yellow because of autumn where he comes across a forked road)</strong></p><p>And sorry I could not travel both <strong>(he 'regrets' that he could not be 2 people and travel both) </strong></p><p>And be one traveler, long I stood <strong>(he stays for a while,)</strong></p><p>And looked down one as far as I could<strong> (trying to figure out where each leads to)</strong></p><p>To where it bent in the undergrowth; <strong>(unfortunatly, he couldn't see the end because the forest was too dense and the path wasn't straight.)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Then took the other, as just as fair, <strong>(the narrator looks at the other path) </strong>And having perhaps the better claim, <strong>(and thinks it's a good choice)</strong></p><p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <strong>(because it looks less used)</strong></p><p>Though as for that the passing there </p><p>Had worn them really about the same, <strong>(but after passing the second one, he realizes both were equally worn)</strong></p><p></p><p>And both that morning equally lay </p><p>In leaves no step had trodden black. <strong>(reinforces statement that the path is covered in leaves because no one has walked on it yet)</strong></p><p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!<strong> (says that he will save the other path for another time)</strong></p><p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way, </p><p>I doubted if I should ever come back. <strong>(but much like life, one path leads to another, and the speaker realizes that he may not return to the first path)</strong></p><p></p><p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p><p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:  <strong>(in the distant future, the narrator is now recounting his story of making a choice)</strong></p><p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I- </p><p>I took the one less traveled by, </p><p>And that has made all the difference. <strong>(he was faced with a choice between two roads and chose to take the road that was less traveled, and the outcomes of that decision have made all the difference in his life)</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Here is the summary of each stanza.</p><p>In the first stanza, the poet is talking about a forked road in the woods. When connected to reality, we can see that the woods represent a person's life, and the forked roads as the choices we make as we travel. The speaker describes himself as staring at the path as far as his eyes could see, but much like our life, we cannot see the end without traveling on it.</p><p></p><p>The second stanza describes one of the paths being pleasing to the eye, yet it was worn out just the same as the other. This beautiful path looks nice at a glance, but unless you look deeper into it, you wouldn't notice the "strings attached" or its "catch".</p><p></p><p>Stanza three mentions that the second path had not been traveled by the previous voyager. Due to this, it adds charm to the road and entices the narrator. He continues on that road and sticks with it for a day.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, he did not regret the decision of sticking with the path "less traveled by."</p><br />
