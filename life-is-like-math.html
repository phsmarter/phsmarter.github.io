II. It seemed like an ordinary day when she got up that morning, but Lynda was about to embark on the worst day of her life. First, she fell in the bathtub because her mother forgot to rinse out the bath oil. Then she spilled orange juice on the outfit she had spent hours putting together for school pictures. When she changed, she messed up the French braid her mother had put in her hair. As she walked out the door, she dropped all of her school books and her math homework flew away. Once she made it to the car she thought everything would be all right. She was wrong; her father didn't look before he backed out of the driveway and ran into the neighbor’s truck. Lynda’s side of the car was damaged the most, and she ended up with a broken arm. That night, she cried herself to sleep.

                                            Galleo and His TelescopeGalileo Gallel was bom in the year 1564. He was born in the town of Pisa, in what is now Italy. When he was 20 years old, he was studying in Pao. His father wanted him to be a doctor. Galileo was bored with school. The only subject he really liked was math. Because he was doing well in math, the court mathematician offered to tutor nimprivately. He said he could become a qualified mathematician. Galleo's father was disappointed, but he agreed. Because he needed to earn money. Galleo begon experimenting with different things. He tried to come up with an invention he could sell for money. He had some success with one invention it was like a compass that could be used to measure land. He experimented with pendulums, thermometers, and magnets. He heard that a Dutch inventor had invented something called a spyglass. The inventor was trying to keep it a secret, Galleo decided to work on one of his own. Within 24 hours, he had invented a telescope. It could magnity things to make them appear ten times larger than real life, One night, he pointed he telescope toward the sky. He made his first of many space observations. Everyone mought the moon was smooth Galleo saw that it wasn't. The moon was covered in bumps and craters. As technology hos Improved, Galileo and many others have made improvements on the telescope. Today, the telescope is a wonderful device that lets us see objects far, far away.Nasa picture po Ang tanong kwento naman po Ang text pasagot po Ng maayos pls​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I sometimes ask the same question to myself. Pero if you think about it, like, to find a job na masusuport ka talaga - a job na may decent salary, you need to have education, diba? Meaning kailangan mo grumaduate sa school. There are jobs not really related to math, pero what about daily life? If we may want to cook for ourselves, without the proper knowledge in math, we may not get what we desire or expected. Pero since ang tanong mo ay complex math, medyo nakakataka rin e. Even I couldn't really think of a good reason. I guess you just have to learn it so you can pass your studies, graduate, and find a job? Ang lifeless nung last sentence before this sentence. I guess we just have to learn it. The more you know. </p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>This is an opinion of mine, you may agree/disagree if you want to. But I hope this helps kahit papano.

about to embark on the worst day of her life. First, she fell in the bathtub
because her mother forgot to rinse out the bath oil. Then she spilled orange juice
on the outfit she had spent hours putting together for school pictures. When she
changed, she messed up the French braid her mother had put in her hair. As she
walked out the door, she dropped all of her school books and her math
homework flew away. Once she made it to the car she thought everything would
be all right. She was wrong; her father didn't look before he backed out of the
driveway and ran into the neighbor’s truck. Lynda’s side of the car was damaged
the most, and she ended up with a broken arm. That night, she cried herself to
sleep.

When he was 20 years old, he was studying in Pao. His father wanted him to be a doctor. Galileo was bored with school. The only subject he really liked was math. Because he was doing well in math, the court mathematician offered to tutor nimprivately. He said he could become a qualified mathematician. Galleo's father was disappointed, but he agreed. Because he needed to earn money. Galleo begon experimenting with different things. He tried to come up with an invention he could sell for money. He had some success with one invention it was like a compass that could be used to measure land. He experimented with pendulums, thermometers, and magnets. He heard that a Dutch inventor had invented something called a spyglass. The inventor was trying to keep it a secret, Galleo decided to work on one of his own. Within 24 hours, he had invented a telescope. It could magnity things to make them appear ten times larger than real life, One night, he pointed he telescope toward the sky. He made his first of many space observations. Everyone mought the moon was smooth Galleo saw that it wasn't. The moon was covered in bumps and craters. As technology hos Improved, Galileo and many others have made improvements on the telescope. Today, the telescope is a wonderful device that lets us see objects far, far away.Nasa picture po Ang tanong kwento naman po Ang text pasagot po Ng maayos pls​</h2><br />

                        The 8 Defining Characteristics of a Best Friend:<br /><br />1. TELEPATHY<br />Your best friend has the uncanny ability to read your mind before the words pop out of your mouth. Just by exchanging a glance, you both know exactly what the other is thinking. <br /><br />2. HONESTY<br />Whether you have a piece of broccoli stuck in your teeth or you are about to embark on a major life decision, your best friend is there to give you their real opinion. While sometimes it can seem a bit harsh or they may even disagree with your choices, your best friend won't hide their views – especially if they think it's in your best interest. <br /><br />3. HUMOR<br />Rolling on the floor laughing till your stomach hurts doesn't happen with just anyone. Best friends know exactly what will trigger a belly-aching laugh, and between the personal jokes and shared experiences, your bestie knows how to tickle your funny bone. <br /><br />4. EMPATHY<br />Your best friend can actually feel what you are going through - because they have been there before. Or, they simply relate to you on such a deep level that they can profoundly understand what you are experiencing.<br /><br />5. GENEROSITY<br />Giving is something that comes naturally between best friends, with each person willing to share what they have with the other. A true friendship has boundaries, but abundance is key. No tabs are kept on who gives and who receives, creating a flow of sharing and caring between you both.  <br /><br />6. TRUST<br />Secrets, fears and deep thoughts are just some of the things you freely share with your best friend - because you know that what you say remains in the vault. Your best friend would never use your private information against you or to hurt you in any way.<br /><br />7. ENCOURAGEMENT<br />Your bestie thinks that you are awesome and is there to give you a boost when you are feeling low. As your personal cheerleader, your best friend reminds you of how many great things you have to offer the world, always focusing on your positive attributes that make you shine. <br /><br />8. STEADFASTNESS<br />Your best friend has your back!
