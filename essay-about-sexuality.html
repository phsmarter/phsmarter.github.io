                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>a kind of reproductionwich begins with the union of gametes</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Asexual and Sexual Reproduction in Soft Corals</p><p></p><p>The battle between sexual and asexual reproduction is a competition that has been ongoing for millions of years. Somewhere along the way due to its higher level of genetic variation, sexual reproduction was able to overcome the two fold advantage of asexual reproduction, and now dominates reproduction in organisms. However, some types of organisms such as worms and corals have acquired the ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually. The purpose of this paper is to explore the differences in asexual and sexual reproduction both from a biological and an evolutionary standpoint and to explain why evolution has made it possible for soft corals to reproduce both sexually and asexually.</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Soft corals are very widespread among the Great Barrier Reef and other Indo-Pacific coral reefs. On the Great Barrier Reef they may cover up to 37% of the reef area (Bastidas, et. al, 2001). Even though soft corals are abundant on the Great Barrier Reef they have been overshadowed by the study of hard corals. Very little research has been conducted on them, yet they are just as fascinating as their hard coral neighbors. The main purpose of this paper is to explain why evolution has made it possible for soft corals to reproduce both sexually and asexually. To do this I will first introduce soft corals, then explain the types of reproduction soft corals are capable of, and finally explain why evolution has made it possible for soft corals to reproduce both sexually and asexually, using numerous studies to support my claims. Most of the information on this topic was very species specific, but this paper will explain the reproductive evolution of soft corals in a broader array that will pertain to the scientific order Alcyonacea, or all types of soft corals.</p><p></p><p>What are soft corals?</p><p></p><p>Soft corals are grouped in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, and order Alcyonacea. Their distinguishing characteristic is that their polyps always bear eight tentacles which are on both edges fringed by rows of pinnules (Fabricius and De’ath, 2002). The common name “soft coral” comes from the fact that they have no massive external skeleton as compared to the more commonly studied hard corals.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay hmmm</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sexual self ammp pano?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Writing Your Sexual Self
<p>All journals are private, personal documents and should be respected as such. A sex journal is not something you would publish. For you to be totally honest with yourself and put into words your most elusive and secret feelings, you can't be concerned about how you might sound to others, whether they might be appalled, excited or angry by your words. Therefore, your journal must be kept private, and you must feel confident that it will not be read by others. Writing a journal is a lot like having a conversation with yourself in your mind. Worrying about eavesdroppers will keep you from speaking your truth.
</p><p>
</p><p>For this reason, I strongly recommend that you plan not to share your sex journal. You will handicap your process by spectatoring. That is, you will be watching yourself in a detached and emotionally removed way—even before you begin. That censorship, whether conscious or not, will inhibit the many benefits you can achieve from keeping this journal.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, as your journal progesses, you may want to share your discoveries about your sexual self with your lover, spouse, psychotherapist or closest confidant. Talking about sex with a partner is part of being sexual. Admitting your most private desires and fears can improve your sense of yourself as a separate, authentic person as well as improve emotional intimacy. By talking about what you learn, your sexual relationship with your partner will improve. But rather than share your writing in its entirety, you may want to talk about what you've discovered, keeping this very personal journal personal: for your eyes only.</p><br />

                            8. 500 word essay about Advantages and disavantages of asexual and sexual reproduction ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that only involves one organism, whereas sexual reproduction involves two organisms. There are both advantages and disadvantages to both types of reproduction.</p><p></p><p>One advantage of asexual reproduction is that it is a much faster way for an organism to reproduce. Because only one organism is involved, there is no need for the time and energy that is required for two organisms to find each other and mate. This means that an organism that reproduces asexually can produce many more offspring in a shorter period of time, which can be beneficial for the survival of the species.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage of asexual reproduction is that it is a more efficient way to reproduce. Because there is only one organism involved, there is no need for the organism to invest energy in finding a mate and producing eggs or sperm. This means that the organism can use its energy more efficiently, which can be beneficial for its survival.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also disadvantages to asexual reproduction. One disadvantage is that it can lead to a lack of genetic diversity within a population. Because only one organism is involved in asexual reproduction, the offspring will be genetically identical to the parent. This can make the population more vulnerable to disease and other threats, because all of the individuals in the population will have the same weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, sexual reproduction involves two organisms, which allows for greater genetic diversity within a population. When two organisms mate, their genetic material is combined, which can result in offspring that are different from both parents. This can be beneficial for the survival of the population, because it means that not all individuals in the population will have the same weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also disadvantages to sexual reproduction. One disadvantage is that it is a slower and more energy-intensive process than asexual reproduction. Because two organisms are involved, there is a greater investment of time and energy required in order to find a mate and produce offspring. This can be disadvantageous for the survival of the individual organism, because it must devote more resources to reproduction.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, both asexual and sexual reproduction have advantages and disadvantages. Asexual reproduction is a faster and more efficient way to reproduce, but it can lead to a lack of genetic diversity within a population. Sexual reproduction allows for greater genetic diversity, but it is a slower and more energy-intensive process.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Sexuality is also separate from gender identity, which is a person’s sense of their own gender, or sociocultural classification (i.e., man, woman, or another gender) based on biological sex (i.e., male or female). It is also distinct from—although it shapes—sexual orientation, or one’s emotional and sexual attraction to a particular sex or gender.</p><p></p><p>Sexuality may be experienced and expressed in a variety of ways, including thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles, and relationships. These manifest themselves not only in biological, physical, and emotional ways, but also in sociocultural ways, which have to do with the effects of human society and culture on one’s sexuality. Some researchers believe that sexual behavior is determined by genetics; however, others assert that it is largely molded by the environment. Human sexuality impacts, and is impacted by, cultural, political, legal, and philosophical aspects of life, and can interact with issues of morality, ethics, theology, spirituality, or religion.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> hope it helps </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Human sexuality is a multifaceted topic.Discussions of sexuality can and should include information about anatomy, physiology, gender roles, sexual identity, love, interpersonal relationships, social/cultural factors as revealed in community standards and laws, and moral/spiritual/religious effects on sexuality.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>human sexuality is the way in which we experience and express ourselves as sexual beings (Rathus et al., 1993). There are many factors that help develop our sexuality, arguably one of the most important, is our actual gender. Whether, I am a male or female will likely have a major influence on the development of my individual sexuality. Furthermore, sexuality is an integral part of our personalities whether we are aware of it or not.” Ludwin Molina. Here is my definition to me it is just the attraction to someone. The way you feel towards them mainly sexual feelings.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Every culture has a different belief or value when it comes to making sexual decisions. I would say it…show more content…</p><p>Like I said before the generations look at it very differently today’s generation is very much more accepting to it and older generations look down upon it they do not agree with it. I believe it just depends how you were raised and the times and places you have lived in.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>All people are made up of genetics from there parents. Wither a male or female each person is different not one can be the same. Gender roles have varied threw the generations. In the fifties women stayed home, cooked, cleaned and took care of the family while the men worked and brought food home for the family. Now the roles are very different. Men and Women are pretty equal, anything men do women have the same chance. Men also sometimes are the ones staying home taking care of the family. It is much more equal know. Relating to human sexuality it is much more accepted in the society it is not looked down upon to be affection.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Sexual arousal varies, it can be from all senses vision, smell, touch, taste, and hearing Vision because with human sexuality is when none sees some one and they are attracted to something goes off. This feeling comes upon them when they are around them see them or think of them. It is love/like or sexual attraction.</p><br />

                            27. 500 words essay about advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that involves only one parent and produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent. This type of reproduction is found in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and some plants and animals. Some of the advantages of asexual reproduction include the ability to reproduce quickly, the ability to reproduce in a wide range of environmental conditions, and the ability to reproduce without the need for a mate.</p><p></p><p>One of the main disadvantages of asexual reproduction is that it lacks genetic diversity. Since the offspring are genetically identical to the parent, they are more susceptible to diseases and other threats that can wipe out an entire population. In contrast, sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two reproductive cells, which results in offspring that have a unique combination of genes from both parents. This genetic diversity can provide a degree of protection against diseases and other threats, as well as increased adaptability to changing environmental conditions.<br /><br />Another disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that it can lead to the accumulation of harmful mutations over time. Since the offspring are genetically identical to the parent, any harmful mutations that occur in the parent will be passed on to the offspring. In contrast, sexual reproduction allows for the mixing of genes from two different individuals, which can help to reduce the impact of harmful mutations.</p><p></p><p>Despite these disadvantages, asexual reproduction has some distinct advantages. For example, it allows organisms to reproduce quickly and efficiently, which can be important for species that need to quickly colonize new environments or take advantage of temporary resources. Additionally, asexual reproduction can be advantageous in situations where finding a mate is difficult or impossible, such as in harsh or isolated environments.<br /><br />In conclusion, both asexual and sexual reproduction have their own advantages and disadvantages. Asexual reproduction allows for rapid reproduction and does not require a mate, but it lacks genetic diversity and can lead to the accumulation of harmful mutations. In contrast, sexual reproduction provides genetic diversity and can help to reduce the impact of harmful mutations, but it requires the presence of a mate and can be more complex and time-consuming than asexual reproduction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. Essay: Discuss about your sexuality ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An essay on my sexuality.</p><p>I am a woman who is married to a man. Neither of us identifies as heterosexual, but because of our monogamous relationship, we are afforded all of the privileges and benefits of being straight-by-default.</p><p></p><p>I am not shy about my attraction to women, but I think most people would consider me to be straight since inquiries of sexuality rarely come up when you are married. I also generally tend not to bring it up myself since my preferences are somewhat uncommon, and I worry that it might be challenging to explain.</p><p></p><p>Sexuality is easy to define when your preference for both romantic and sexual attraction is the same. However, there are some people for whom romantic and sexual attraction are two completely different schools of thought. I fall into that camp.</p><p></p><p>I identified as bisexual for a while, but it never felt like a true fit for me. I have never felt that I am attracted to “both” men and women. Rather, I have always felt that I am attracted to a certain set of characteristics and gender didn’t really matter all that much to me. I also tend not to be attracted to women who are super feminine or men who are traditionally masculine. I am more attracted to people who fall somewhere in the middle. People who lean more on the androgynous side, and have a balance of masculinity and femininity.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, I considered myself pansexual for a while. Which felt better but still wasn’t quite right. Although I definitely am romantically attracted to people regardless of their gender, I am very rarely sexually attracted to anyone.</p><p></p><p>I am someone who has never been interested in casual sex. I am not morally opposed to it, it’s just not for me. When I experience an initial attraction to someone it is more aesthetic than physical. Sex is never at the forefront of my mind when I have a crush on someone. All of my fantasies involve non-sexual intimate things like cuddling, caressing, kissing, etc. If I’m ogling a celebrity my mind goes straight to “oh gosh they are so adorable I just want to kiss their cheeks and tell them how adorable they are.”</p><p></p><p>When it comes to sex I am aroused more through my connection with a person, than by their parts. This is probably one of the reasons I have always been friends with a person for a long time before beginning a relationship. I have only had a couple of serious relationships and due to physical expectations have always been wary of jumping into relationships. I need to really get to know someone before it goes there. It takes a lot of emotional intimacy, trust, and a strong bond before I am comfortable even thinking about opening up to someone sexually.</p><p></p><p>It wasn’t until I learned that there were different types of asexuality that everything really clicked for me. If you want to get technical, I currently I identify as a panromantic demisexual. Which basically means: What is in your pants not only does not have any effect on whether I am attracted to you, but TBH I don’t even really want to know what’s going on in there until we have reached a very intimate level of our relationship.</p><p></p><p>As I get older I am also becoming more comfortable with the term queer to define my sexuality. For a long time the term left a bad taste in my mouth. I went to college in North Carolina and in the American South “queer” is still used as a derogatory slur. However hearing it used more and more in the GSD/LGBTQ+ community as a reclaimed word, it really is sort of the perfect umbrella term for anything that isn’t exclusively gay, straight, or bi. It definitely feels like more of a broad spectrum term that encompasses all types of attraction.</p><p></p><p>So that was essentially my journey to decoding my sexuality as a queer woman. As a society we have both come a long way and still have a long way to go in accepting gender and sexual diversity. Education is key. People are most afraid of the things that they cannot understand. I really hope that if we keep these kinds of conversations going, someday people who experience all different types of attraction won’t have to feel that it is so difficult or complicated to talk about.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
