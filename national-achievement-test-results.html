The Philippines had an average reading score of 340, more than 200 points below China (555) and more than 100 points less than the OECD average (487).In the Philippines, boys’ and girls’ performances in reading both ranked lowest among PISA-participating countries.“Reading proficiency is essential for a wide variety of human activities - from following instructions in a manual; to finding out the who, what, when, where, and why of an event; to communicating with others for a specific purpose or transaction,” the summary of the PISA 2018 results reads.The Philippines also placed the second-lowest in mathematics (353), along with Panama, and science (357). Only the Dominican Republic scored lower in these categories.China also led the ranking in mathematics and science. The OECD average for mathematics is 489 and the average for science is 483.“Results from PISA indicate the quality and equity of learning outcomes attained around the world, and allow educators and policymakers to learn from the policies and practices applied in other countries,” a post on the OECD website reads.According to the PISA 2018 profile of the Philippines, socio-economic status accounts for 18% of the variance in reading performance in the country, compared to the OECD average of 12%.The country has the largest percentage of low performers in reading among socio-economically disadvantaged students.The profile noted that average class sizes of 15-year olds in the Philippines are the largest, and the ratio of students to teaching staff in socio-economically disadvantaged schools is the highest.The Philippines also had the highest percentage of students reporting being bullied at least a few times a month.Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they did not expect high marks based on National Achievement Test results, according to a report by The STAR.Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they were not expecting high marks for the Philippines, noting the results of the National Achievement Test which showed low proficiency levels in Science, Math and English​</a>

CategoryIn the News·         Date PublishedJan 09, 2023National Achievement Test for Grade 12 students setMANILA, Philippines — Grade 12 students from public and private schools will be taking the National Achievement Test (NAT) by the end of the month.In a memorandum released on Jan. 5, Education Undersecretary Epimaco Densing said the exit assessment, which was designed to be “progressive in nature,” would be administered on Jan. 30 and Jan. 31.“DepEd has to identify and articulate indicators and targets for measuring performance in the development of plans and policies,” he said.The test results will serve as data and evidence in improving the implementation of the curriculum, as well as evidence-based decision-making.According to Densing, the test items would measure varying levels of skills through a multiple-choice paper-based format.“It is designed to determine if graduating learners are meeting the learning standard in the senior high school (SHS) curriculum,” he said.The NAT result will also give insight into the percentage of Grade 12 students who have the minimum level of proficiency in the fourth stage of the SHS core areas.The test will cover 21st-century skills and the primary learning topics in SHS including languages, humanities, communication, mathematics, science, social science, and philosophy.An online national orientation was held on Jan. 6 to issue the specific guidelines for the test administration and the tasks of field-testing personnel and download of program support funds by the schools’ division office.In a study published last year, the government think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) pointed out that failure to let the public know about the NAT results had contributed to the ongoing education crisis.“Even though we continuously administer national achievement tests, the results are never granularly available for in-depth analysis and even less public discussion,” said the report authored by PIDS president Aniceto Orbeta Jr. and research fellow vicente paqueo help!!​</h2><br />
