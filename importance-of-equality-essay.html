I will mark you the brainliest  if you help me thanks.The video tells us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they’re from, what they look and what their religion is. They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</a>

                                            Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

Every individual of the society yearns for equal status, opportunity, and rights. However, it is a general observation that there exists lots of discrimination between humans. Discrimination exists because of cultural differences, geographical differences, and gender. Inequality based on gender is a concern that is prevalent in the entire world.  Even in the 21st century, across globe men and women do not enjoy equal privileges. Gender equality means providing equal opportunities to both men and women in political, economic, education and health aspects.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A nation can progress and attain higher development growth only when both men and women are entitled to equal opportunities.

When women participate in the workforce increases the economic growth rate of the country increases. Gender equality increases the overall wellbeing of the nation along with economic prosperity</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Gender equality is necessary and important because both males and females deserve their rights, so this is why feminism and masculism exists. Furthermore, we have to respect those genders in our biosphere, to be respected by them too. People in our earth needs respect and care, so achieving gender equality is necessary because it shows the strengths of those genders and respects. </strong></p><p></p><br />

                            12. Essay: Answer this in 3 to5 sentences…
1. Why is it important to create an online environment that is close to the one we
currently have?
2. There are some websites that does not employ web 2.0 features. Do you think
these websites must upgrade or not? Why?
3. If you will choose among the multimedia, what will you use to promote this
advocacy: Stop strand discrimination. We are all equal. Explain your answer.
4. Based on the events, did the Filipinos properly and effectively exercise their
digital citizenship? Why?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Creating an online environment that is close to the one we currently have is important because it helps ensure continuity and stability in our personal and professional lives. This is especially crucial during times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when online communication and collaboration have become essential. By replicating familiar aspects of our physical environment, such as social interactions, routines, and workflows, we can reduce the cognitive load and stress associated with adapting to new technologies and platforms.</p><p></p><p>2. Websites that do not employ web 2.0 features may still be useful and effective for certain purposes, depending on their target audience and objectives. However, upgrading to web 2.0 features can provide many benefits, such as improved interactivity, collaboration, and user engagement. These features can also enhance the accessibility, usability, and aesthetics of websites, which can lead to better user experiences and outcomes.</p><p></p><p>3. To promote the advocacy "Stop strand discrimination. We are all equal," I would use a combination of multimedia tools, including videos, infographics, social media posts, and online forums. Videos can convey powerful messages and emotions that can resonate with viewers and raise awareness about the issue. Infographics can present complex data and statistics in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. Social media posts can reach a broad audience and encourage discussions and sharing of ideas. Online forums can provide a platform for people to express their opinions, share their experiences, and collaborate on solutions.</p><p></p><p>4. The effectiveness of Filipinos exercising their digital citizenship during recent events can be subjective and dependent on various factors, such as the context, goals, and outcomes. However, there were instances where Filipinos demonstrated responsible and ethical online behavior, such as sharing accurate information, raising awareness about social issues, and promoting unity and solidarity. There were also instances of irresponsible and harmful online behavior, such as spreading misinformation, hate speech, and cyberbullying. Therefore, it is essential to continue promoting digital citizenship education and awareness to foster a positive online culture and maximize the benefits of digital technologies.</p><br />

They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</h2><br />

Actually, successful people achieve their goals in life and work through effective and efficient decision making. The decision making process is usually guided by an individual’s beliefs, values, and attitudes as well concepts. While a person can use various concepts in making decisions, they should be very careful to select a concept that is effective and contributes to huge success. Nonetheless, these concepts exist to help an individual become a better decision maker in the world around him/her. Decision Making Concepts Resonating with Me: As previously mentioned, there are various decision making concepts that enable an individual to become a better decision maker in his/her daily life. One of these concepts that resonate with me as a decision maker is the WRAP model. WRAP model is a major concept because it enables a person to make his/her decisions through intentional illumination of strategic spots or points of consideration (Heath &amp; Heath, 2013, p.24). In this case, the decision is not made on the basis of what ordinarily comes to a person’s attention but through examining hidden corners or facts. WRAP model basically involves widening options, reality-test of assumptions, attaining distance before deciding, and preparing to be wrong. The widening of options primarily focuses on expanding the set of choices through identifying new options and analyzing them. This is followed by asking craftier questions in order to filter the information and collect trustworthy ones. Since making a choice at this stage may result in a bad decision, the next step is to developin... ... middle of paper ... ...ividuals understand how their minds process auditory and visual information and potential biases that contributes to certain kinds of behaviors. As individuals become increasingly aware of their biases, they begin to question and examine them through rational decision making process in order to alter or improve their behaviors by making better decisions. In conclusion, decision making is an important concept in everyday life because it is linked to success and effectiveness in various situations. This process is usually carried out based on various concepts and models such as WRAP model. The ability of an individual to make the most appropriate decision in a particular decision is based on his/her ability to choose the best possible concept or process for decision making. However, one should not be rigid when using a particular decision making model or concept.</p><p></p><br />

The distinction between them has to do with how equally the atoms participating in the bond share their electrons. In this activity, make an essay in which you identify the common compounds you use at home and give their importance.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Atoms are the smallest units of matter that still retain the fundamental chemical properties of an element. Much of the study of chemistry, however, involves looking at what happens when atoms combine with other atoms to form compounds. A compound is a distinct group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Just as the structure of the atom is held together by the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons surrounding it, the stability within chemical bonds is also due to electrostatic attractions. To illustrate further, consider the two major types of chemical bonds: covalent bonds and ionic bonds. In covalent bonds, two atoms share pairs of electrons, while in ionic bonds, electrons are fully transferred between two atoms so that ions are formed. Let’s consider both types of bonds in detail.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>please brainlies</p><br />

                            28. Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />

                        Equality or non-discrimination is that state where every individual gets equal opportunities and rights.
