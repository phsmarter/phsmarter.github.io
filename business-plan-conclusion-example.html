On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</a>

                                            The Cobra Effect The British colonized India from 1858 to 1947. That means that they ruled the country. They governed the Indian people. They used India to make wealth for the British Empire. But they also developed India. They built canals and railroads. They tried to make India more like the United Kingdom. Yet India was different from the UK. It was more rustic. The ecology was different too. Some British colonists had a hard time adapting. The snakes were particularly troubling. The capital area of Delhi was overrun with venomous cobras. Encountering a cobra is quite frightening. It's even worse getting bit by one. The cobras killed many colonists. Enough died that the British government took action. They paid a bounty for every dead cobra. The program was a success at first. Many people hunted and killed the cobras for the rewards. The number of cobras dropped. The colonists felt safer. But then it became harder to catch cobras. So enterprising people started breeding them. After all, it is easier to catch a pet cobra than a wild one. News of this scheme got back to the British government. They learned that people were breeding cobras to earn rewards. This is not what the British wanted to happen. They felt foolish. They scrapped the program. Now the breeders were angry. Raising cobras can be challenging. They were doing it for the money. When the program ended, the snakes were worthless. So the breeders released them into the wild. Now there were more wild cobras than when the program started. The British plan seemed like a good idea at first. In practice though, it made things much worse. This is the cobra effect. The cobra effect is when a solution worsens a problem. Many well-intentioned programs backfire. In 2014 the City of Chicago banned lightweight plastic bags. Single use bags are bad for the environment. They end up in the water. They pollute the land. City officials wanted people to reuse bags. So they put a tax on lightweight bags. Retailers did not want to anger customers with the new tax. So they made their bags much thicker. The new bags were 150 times thicker than the old bags. The thicker bags were no longer lightweight, so they weren't taxed. But most customers did not reuse these bags. They just threw away the really thick plastic bags. This is another example of the cobra effect. The city intended to reduce plastic waste, yet the tax worsened it 150 fold.

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.

                            4. The Cobra Effect The British colonized India from 1858 to 1947. That means that they ruled the country. They governed the Indian people. They used India to make wealth for the British Empire. But they also developed India. They built canals and railroads. They tried to make India more like the United Kingdom. Yet India was different from the UK. It was more rustic. The ecology was different too. Some British colonists had a hard time adapting. The snakes were particularly troubling. The capital area of Delhi was overrun with venomous cobras. Encountering a cobra is quite frightening. It's even worse getting bit by one. The cobras killed many colonists. Enough died that the British government took action. They paid a bounty for every dead cobra. The program was a success at first. Many people hunted and killed the cobras for the rewards. The number of cobras dropped. The colonists felt safer. But then it became harder to catch cobras. So enterprising people started breeding them. After all, it is easier to catch a pet cobra than a wild one. News of this scheme got back to the British government. They learned that people were breeding cobras to earn rewards. This is not what the British wanted to happen. They felt foolish. They scrapped the program. Now the breeders were angry. Raising cobras can be challenging. They were doing it for the money. When the program ended, the snakes were worthless. So the breeders released them into the wild. Now there were more wild cobras than when the program started. The British plan seemed like a good idea at first. In practice though, it made things much worse. This is the cobra effect. The cobra effect is when a solution worsens a problem. Many well-intentioned programs backfire. In 2014 the City of Chicago banned lightweight plastic bags. Single use bags are bad for the environment. They end up in the water. They pollute the land. City officials wanted people to reuse bags. So they put a tax on lightweight bags. Retailers did not want to anger customers with the new tax. So they made their bags much thicker. The new bags were 150 times thicker than the old bags. The thicker bags were no longer lightweight, so they weren't taxed. But most customers did not reuse these bags. They just threw away the really thick plastic bags. This is another example of the cobra effect. The city intended to reduce plastic waste, yet the tax worsened it 150 fold. Our actions do not always have the consequences that we expect. 1. Which best defines the word colonize as used in the FIRST paragraph? To destroy or ruin a foreign land		C. To trade or do business with other people To inhabit and rule a foreign land		D. To do battle or fight with another group of people 2. Which conclusion can be supported with text from the passage? India had MORE poisonous snakes than the UK.	 India had FEWER poisonous snakes than the UK. India had the SAME amount of poisonous snakes as UK India DID NOT have poisonous snakes. 3. Which event happened LAST? The number of snakes decreased. The government began paying a bounty for dead snakes. The snake breeders released their cobras into the wild. People started breeding snakes.​</h2><br />

                            10. Identify the appropriate areas and best transition signalCarabaos and cows are importantfarm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar)other animals, they both help farmers inproducing milk and other farm and dairyproducts. Meat, 12) (namely/for example),is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3](Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cowsproduce. 141 (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread orstuffing for varieties of bread 151 (that is such as) pandesal and loaf bread. 19(Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we needin our daily lives.Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents tofinancially support me with my studies. 171 (As a result/Accordingly), my familyrecorded and generated small return of investment for that year. 181 (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help ofmy uncle.Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. 191 (On the other hand/Togetherwith) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farmbusiness. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, investedlarge amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (Infact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Ourhumble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. (12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500liters of milk per day (13) (importantly/notwithstanding) the ElNiñophenomenon that we are currently experiencing.[14) (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to furtherexpand our business venture, (15) (for example/to demonstrate), production ofother farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) ourdedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuouslysupport us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now workingon our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore),other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.(19) (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easytask, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may notbelieve in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. Withfaith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos andcows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in townproducing and delivering quality products and goods.​</h2><br />
