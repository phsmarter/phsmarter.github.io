                        Being inlove with your best friend is better than to a total stranger because it is an advantage of building your foundation of trust to each other but some people chooses to love others to protect the friendship to their best friends.<br /><br /><br />            Most people wonder who the one is meant for them. It can be anyone but it would be better if it is someone close to you like, your best friend. Being inlove with your best friend is better because you already know each other well and you know that he/she will never hurt you, and if you’re committed to your best friend you’ll have a friend and a lover as well.<br /><br />            I agree that being inlove with your best friend is better rather than to others, because loving your best friend is safe because you know each other very well and you understand each other’s problems/ sides. It is also more comfortable to spend time with your best friend because you’re used to be with each other. For example, if you are to pick a total stranger and your best friend, who will you pick? The person whom you don’t know and might break your heart or the person you’ve know for a long time and you know that will never hurt you? Don’t always look far; look around you he/she might just be beside you.<br /><br />            Moreover, loving your best friend is better because you already know his/her family, what she/he really is. It will not be difficult if you’ll face a problem because you guys can understand each other, because you know each other long enough. You’ll be happier if you choose the person who really knows who you are, he/she knows how to make you laugh and how to stop you from crying.<br /><br />                Lastly, loving your best friend is better than others because your heart is safe with your best friend. Your best friend knows you want and what you deserve. He/she will not love any other than you, and if your relationship will end, you’ll lose a lover but not your best friend. Loving someone that you truly know and care will lead you to a happy love life. <br />

He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</h2><br />
