                                            8Activity 4Direction: Make your own concept map of the four subsystems of the Earth (Atmosphere, Lithosphere, Biosphere, Hydrosphere). Use a separate sheet of paper. Note: Use the information below as your reference.INFORMATION ABOUT EARTH’S FOUR SUBSYSTEMS: 1. Definition of a System A set of interconnected components that are interacting to form a unified whole. 2. The Earth system is essentially a closed system. It receives energy from the sun and returns some of this energy to space.3. Atmosphere.A. The atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. B. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O2), 0.9% argon, and trace amount of other gases. C. One of the most important processes by which the heat on the Earth's surface is redistributed is through atmospheric circulation. D. There is also a constant exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and thehydrosphere through the hydrologic cycle.4. Lithosphere. A. The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</a>

Use a separate sheet of paper. Note: Use the information below as your reference.INFORMATION ABOUT EARTH’S FOUR SUBSYSTEMS: 1. Definition of a System A set of interconnected components that are interacting to form a unified whole. 2. The Earth system is essentially a closed system. It receives energy from the sun and returns some of this energy to space.3. Atmosphere.A. The atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. B. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O2), 0.9% argon, and trace amount of other gases. C. One of the most important processes by which the heat on the Earth's surface is redistributed is through atmospheric circulation. D. There is also a constant exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and thehydrosphere through the hydrologic cycle.4. Lithosphere. A. The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</a>

                                            ENGLISH MELC 21: Give expanded definitions of words. Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it. Formal Definition ng maile others iso Sense of humor is the ability to laugh and make others laugh ↓ A formal definition consists of three parts: the term being defined, the class it belongs to, and its distinguishing characteristics. An informal definition explains an unfamiliar term using synonyms or antonyms introduced by or, in other words, or ike. Take note of how the term sense of humor was defined. Term Class Distinguishing Characteristics Sense of Humor Informal Definition Sense of humor means to appreciate a joke or to perce ve humor ↓ Since expanding basic formal definitions means explaining the differentiating characteristics thoroughly, the following questions may serve as framework: Synonyms What does it do? How is it used? - How does it work? What are its parts? Can it be compared to anything familiar? What is its origin and background? UN techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions listed below may be of great help in answering the aforementioned questions. Be aware, however, that the technique/s to be used will depend on what is appropriate for the term you are trying to define or explain. ​</a>

Non-Linear Text</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Linear text is text that is written and read in a sequential manner, with each sentence building on the previous one to form a coherent narrative or argument. Non-linear text, on the other hand, does not follow a linear structure and allows the reader to access information in any order. A line graph is a type of graph that shows information as a series of data points connected by straight lines. It is often used to show changes or trends over time. A pie chart is a circular chart that shows how a whole is divided into parts, with the size of each section proportional to the quantity it represents. A concept map is a graphical tool that is used to visually represent the relationships between different concepts or ideas. A Venn diagram is a type of diagram that uses circles to show the relationships between two or more subjects, thoughts, ideas, or concepts. It is often used to identify, classify, categorize, and recognize similarities and differences.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>C</p><p>D</p><p>C</p><p>D</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p><p>A</p><p>D</p><p>C</p><p><strong>Explanation:pabrainliest po ty</strong></p><p></p><br />

Note: Use the information below as your reference.INFORMATION ABOUT EARTH’S FOUR SUBSYSTEMS: 1. Definition of a System A set of interconnected components that are interacting to form a unified whole. 2. The Earth system is essentially a closed system. It receives energy from the sun and returns some of this energy to space.3. Atmosphere.A. The atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. B. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen (N), 21% oxygen (O2), 0.9% argon, and trace amount of other gases. C. One of the most important processes by which the heat on the Earth's surface is redistributed is through atmospheric circulation. D. There is also a constant exchange of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and thehydrosphere through the hydrologic cycle.4. Lithosphere. A. The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</h2><br />

The lithosphere includes the rocks of the crust and mantle, the metallic liquid outer core, and the solid metallic inner core. B. Briefly discuss the Plate Tectonics as an important process shaping the surface of the Earth. The primary driving mechanism is the Earth's internal heat, such as that in mantle convection.5. Biosphere. A. The biosphere is the set of all life forms on Earth. B. It covers all ecosystems—from the soil to the rainforest, from mangroves to coral reefs, and from the plankton-rich ocean surface to the deep sea. C. For the majority of life on Earth, the base of the food chain comprises photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, CO2 is sequestered from the atmosphere, while oxygen is released as a byproduct. The biosphere is a CO2 sink, and therefore, an important part of the carbon cycle.D. Sunlight is not necessary for life. 6. Hydrosphere. A. About 70% of the Earth is covered with liquid water (hydrosphere) and much of it is in the form of ocean water. B. Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh: two-thirds are in the form of ice, and the remaining one-third is present in streams, lakes, and groundwater.C. The oceans are important sinks for CO2 through direct exchange with the atmosphere and indirectly through the weathering of rocks. D. Heat is absorbed and redistributed on the surface of the Earth through ocean circulation.Activity 5Direction: Cite at least five function or importance of the four subsystems of the earth.1st Quarter Week 1- (Identify common rock – forming minerals using their physical and chemical properties.)Using Characteristics of Minerals to Identify Them Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.1. HardnessThe ability to resist being scratched—or hardness—is one of the most useful properties for identifying minerals. Hardness is determined by the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, produced a hardness scale (table 5) using a set of ten standard minerals. The scale arranges the minerals in order of increasing hardness. Each higher-numbered (harder) mineral will scratch any mineral with a lower number (softer).A rough measure of mineral hardness can be made by assembling a kit of handy objects (table 6). A fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 2.5, a penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from 5.5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.5.LusterLuster is how a mineral reflects light. The terms metallic and nonmetallic describe the basic types of luster. Table 7 lists the most common terms used to describe luster and an example of a corresponding mineral. Some minerals that don't exhibit luster are referred to as "earthy," "chalky," or "dull."ColorOne of the most obvious properties of a mineral is color. Color should be considered when identifying a mineral, but should never be used as the major identifying characteristic.StreakStreak is the color of the powdered mineral, which is usually more useful for identification than the color of the whole mineral sample. Rubbing the mineral on a streak plate will produce a streak. A streak plate can be made from the unglazed back side of a white porcelain bathroom or kitchen tile. Some minerals won't streak because they are harder than the streak plate.Specific GravitySpecific gravity is the ratio between the mass (weight) of a mineral and the mass (weight) of an equal volume of water. A mineral's specific gravity (SG) can be determined by dividing ​</h2><br />

                            23. ENGLISH MELC 21: Give expanded definitions of words. Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it. Formal Definition ng maile others iso Sense of humor is the ability to laugh and make others laugh ↓ A formal definition consists of three parts: the term being defined, the class it belongs to, and its distinguishing characteristics. An informal definition explains an unfamiliar term using synonyms or antonyms introduced by or, in other words, or ike. Take note of how the term sense of humor was defined. Term Class Distinguishing Characteristics Sense of Humor Informal Definition Sense of humor means to appreciate a joke or to perce ve humor ↓ Since expanding basic formal definitions means explaining the differentiating characteristics thoroughly, the following questions may serve as framework: Synonyms What does it do? How is it used? - How does it work? What are its parts? Can it be compared to anything familiar? What is its origin and background? UN techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions listed below may be of great help in answering the aforementioned questions. Be aware, however, that the technique/s to be used will depend on what is appropriate for the term you are trying to define or explain. ​</h2><br />
