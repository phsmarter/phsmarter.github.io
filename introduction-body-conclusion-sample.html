                            1. What is the meaning of Introduction, Body and Conclusion and sample​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction, body, and conclusion are the three main parts of an essay or any piece of academic writing.</p><p></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: The introduction is the first part of an essay or academic paper that provides background information and sets the stage for the reader. It should grab the reader's attention, provide context for the topic, and end with a clear thesis statement that summarizes the main points of the paper.<br /></p><p>Example: In an essay about the impact of social media on mental health, the introduction might begin with a statistic about the rising use of social media among young people and then explain why this is a relevant and important topic. The thesis statement might be, "This essay will argue that social media use is contributing to increased rates of anxiety and depression among teenagers and young adults."</p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Body</strong>: The body is the main section of an essay or academic paper that presents the evidence and arguments to support the thesis statement. It should be divided into several paragraphs, each focusing on a specific point or aspect of the topic. Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that connects to the thesis statement and is supported by evidence and examples.<br /></p><p>Example: In an essay about the impact of social media on mental health, the body paragraphs might focus on different ways in which social media use can contribute to anxiety and depression, such as cyberbullying, social comparison, and information overload. Each paragraph would provide evidence and examples to support the argument, and would end with a transition sentence connecting to the next paragraph.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The conclusion is the final part of an essay or academic paper that summarizes the main points and restates the thesis statement in a new way. It should also provide some final thoughts or recommendations related to the topic, and leave the reader with a sense of closure.<br /></p><p>Example: In an essay about the impact of social media on mental health, the conclusion might summarize the main points made in the body paragraphs, restate the thesis statement in a new way, and provide some recommendations for how individuals and society can address the negative effects of social media use on mental health. It might also end with a thought-provoking question or call to action to encourage further reflection or action on the topic.</p>Introduction: The first paragraph of your essay. It is the first impression your readers recieve, and explain the main point of your paper. Your introduction contains your thesis statement. Body: The paragraphs in between your introduction and conclusion. The body of your paper supports the main point of your paper.<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong>All of this literary production was accompanied by a strong essayistic tradition whose main topic was the distinctiveness of Latin American culture and, within that culture, the individual cultures of the various countries. Many of the poets and fiction writers mentioned before also wrote essays in this vein: Carpentier, Paz, Borges, Lezama Lima, and Sarduy, for example. But there were writers whose chief production was the essay: the Uruguayan José Enrique Rodó, the Peruvian José Carlos Mariátegui, the Mexicans José Vasconcelos and Alfonso Reyes, the Dominican Pedro Henríquez Ureña, the Venezuelan Mariano Picón Salas, the Cuban Fernando Ortiz, the Argentine Ezequiel Martínez Estrada, the Puerto Rican Antonio Pedreira, and the Colombian Germán Arciniegas. In many cases the issue was how to incorporate marginal cultures (African, Indian) within Latin America into the mainstream culture of the area and of each individual country. The most important and influential of these essays was Ariel (1900; Ariel) by Rodó. In the wake of Spain’s humiliating defeat by the United States in the Spanish American War, Rodó muses about the differences between the cultures of North and South America. In reply to Sarmiento’s glorification of North American culture, Rodó calls for adherence to the spiritual, artistic values of Latin American culture, against the pragmatism and utilitarianism of the great new power to the north. His essay had such a positive reception that “Ariel clubs” were founded in various Latin American countries. Most of the essayistic tradition either followed Rodó or argued against him. In the 1920s Mariátegui proposed a Marxist interpretation of Peruvian society and culture in his 7 ensayos de interpretación de la realidad peruana (1928; Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality). Written in a lively style and surprisingly devoid of cant, Mariátegui’s essay argued in favour of an alliance between the political and artistic avant-gardes. A more scholarly approach was that of Ureña, whose elegant and profound Seis ensayos en busca de nuestra expresión (1928; “Six Essays in Search of Our Mode of Expression”) provides a broad-ranging interpretation of Latin American culture going back to colonial times. In a similar vein, Mariano Picón Salas published in 1944 his De la conquista a la independencia: tres siglos de historia cultural hispanoamericana (A Cultural History of Spanish America, from Conquest to Independence). These essays were incorporated into the curricula of universities throughout the world. At midcentury a powerful essay by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, El laberinto de la soledad (1950; The Labyrinth of Solitude), offered an existentialist and psychoanalytic interpretation of Mexican culture. It had an enormous influence on Mexican fiction and poetry and was imitated by Latin American essayists elsewhere.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>At the turn of the 21st century, Latin America literature seemed to be shifting from the modern to the postmodern. The line of demarcation is not clear. Postmodern literature avails itself of most of the techniques introduced by modern literature, particularly self-consciousness of its own status as literature. The difference, perhaps, is that postmodern literature does not aspire to be profound or pretend that it can make momentous pronouncements about the self, society, the nation, or humankind. The playful element of modern literature has prevailed, a move toward lightness. In Latin America this has meant moving away from the thematics of cultural identity that dominated modern literature and going back to the Romantics. Fiction was dispersed, disseminated among characters of shifting sexuality who did not make up conventional family groups. In the plots of these novels serendipity seems to rule. The herald of postmodern change had been Severo Sarduy. No writer of his stature or that of his predecessors (Borges, Cortázar, García Márquez, etc.) emerged to solidify this tendency. The most significant statement on postmodernism itself was provided by Cuban exile novelist, short-story writer, and essayist Antonio Benítez Rojo (1931), published in his La isla que se repite: el Caribe y la perspectiva postmoderna (1989; The Repeating Island), a worthy successor to the essayistic tradition sketched before.
