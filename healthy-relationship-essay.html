                            10. Identify ways on how to build healthy relationship with others? essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Accept and celebrate differences. One of the biggest challenges we experience in relationships is that we are all different. We can perceive the world in many ways. Certainly astumbling block that we come across when we try to build relationships is a desire or an expectation that people will think like we do and, in this way, it is so much easier to create a rapport. We feel more comfortable when we feel that people “get” us and can see our point of view. Life, however, would be very dull if we were all the same and, while we may find it initially easier, the novelty of sameness soon would wear off. So accepting and celebrating that we are all different is a great starting point.</p><p></p><p>2. Listen effectively. Listening is a crucial skill in boosting another person’s self-esteem, the silent form of flattery that makes people feel supported and valued. Listening and understanding what others communicate to us is the most important part of successful interaction and vice versa.</p><p></p><p>Active or reflective listening is the single most useful and important listening skill. In active listening, we also are genuinely interested in understanding what the other person is thinking, feeling, wanting, or what the message means, and we are active in checking out our understanding before we respond with our own new message. We restate or paraphrase our understanding of their message and reflect it back to the sender for verification. This verification or feedback process is what distinguishes active listening and makes it effective.</p><p></p><p>3. Give people your time. Giving time to people is also a huge gift. In a world where time is of the essence and we are trying to fit in more than one lifetime, we don’t always have the time to give to our loved ones, friends, and work colleagues. Technology has somewhat eroded our ability to build real rapport and we attempt to multi-task by texting and talking at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Being present in the time you give to people is also important, so that, when you are with someone, you are truly with someone and not dwelling in the past or worrying about the future. The connection we make with other people is the verytouchstone of our existence, and devoting time, energy, and effort to developing and building relationships is one of the most valuable life skills.</p><p></p><p>4. Develop your communication skills. Communication occurs when someone understands you, not just when you speak. One of the biggest dangers with communication is that we can work on the assumption that the other person has understood the message we are trying to get across.</p><p></p><p>Poor communication in the workplace can lead to a culture of back stabbing and blame, which, in turn, can affect our stress levels, especially when we don’t understand something or feel we have been misled. It also can have a positive effect on morale when it works well and motivates individuals to want to come into work and do a great job.</p><p></p><p>5. Manage mobile technology. By now, pretty much everyone has a mobile phone and many people have two or more. While they are a lifesaver in an emergency, and an effective tool for communication, they also can be a complete distraction when people exhibit a lack of mobile phone etiquette.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>: )</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. respect.

</strong></p><p><strong>The book Growth and Development states: “Physical intimacy in infancy creates a peaceful and loving bond between mother and baby, forming the basis for personal relationships in the years that follow.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The film’s producers consulted several psychologists, including Dacher Keltner of the University of California, Berkeley, who helped review the film’s story to emphasize the neurological conclusions that interpersonal relationships reflect emotions, and have it also has the potential to be moderated.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Respect and education are an essential part of our social and even academic development, as this promotes a good relationship between people, raising our popularity and leaving us in a comfortable and admirable position among people.</p><p></p><p>This kind of respectful and polite behavior must be encouraged primarily within our family and with our friends, who are the people with whom we live the most, but this behavior must be extended to all the places, people and situations to which we are involved, even if we are in a good mood, or never, we must maintain respect in any situation.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the family environment, we should always help our country with domestic tasks, since the house is also our responsibility. However, this alone is not enough as we must respect, obey and value the life, kindness and actions of those who are older than us, like our parents, grandparents, uncles and even brothers. The youngest members of our family must also be respected and valued, so that they use us as a mirror and inspiration.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the respect we provide at home should be extended to our neighbors, teachers, friends and any citizen, who must also behave with respect towards us. In this way everyone is privileged and society changes for the better, where everyone behaves properly.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
