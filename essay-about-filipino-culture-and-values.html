                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture and traditions of the Filipino people are deeply rooted in their history and shaped by their interactions with various foreign influences. The Philippines is a country with a rich cultural heritage, and the values that underpin Filipino culture reflect the resilience and adaptability of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p>One of the defining characteristics of Filipino culture is the emphasis on family and community. The Filipino people place great importance on the bond between family members and the sense of belonging that comes from being part of a tight-knit community. This value is reflected in the traditional concept of “bayanihan,” which emphasizes the importance of working together for the greater good of the community.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos are also known for their strong sense of hospitality and warmth towards guests. This value is reflected in the traditional practice of “pakikipagkapwa,” which means treating others with kindness and respect. Filipinos are known to go out of their way to make visitors feel welcome in their homes and communities, and this trait is a key part of their culture.</p><p></p><p>Respect for elders and the elderly is another important value in Filipino culture. The elderly are often considered the repository of wisdom and knowledge, and are accorded high regard in Filipino society. This is reflected in the traditional practice of “pagpapakonsiderado” which means to consider the feelings and needs of others.</p><p></p><p>Religion also plays a significant role in Filipino culture. Roman Catholic Christianity is the dominant religion in the Philippines, but many indigenous communities have retained their traditional spiritual practices. The values of respect and devotion to God, family and country are imbued in the Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these values, Filipino culture is also known for its rich artistic traditions. The Philippines has a long history of folk music, dance and visual arts. These traditions are often deeply connected to the natural environment and reflect the spiritual beliefs of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the culture and traditions of the Filipino people are shaped by their history and interactions with various foreign influences. The values that underpin Filipino culture reflect the resilience and adaptability of the Filipino people, and are deeply ingrained in their daily lives. These values, traditions and culture make the Filipino people who they are today, and will continue to shape their future.</p><br />

                            2. Write a Reflective Essay about Filipino Values, Culture and Tradition that affects modern influence of today as a Filipino Citizen.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>As a Filipino citizen, I have been exposed to various values, culture, and traditions that are deeply ingrained in our society. These aspects of our identity have shaped the way we live our lives and interact with others. Our values, culture, and traditions have been passed down from generation to generation, and they continue to have a significant impact on our daily lives.</strong></p><p></p><p>One of the most prominent Filipino values that I have observed is the value of close family ties. In our culture, family always comes first. We are taught to respect and care for our elders, and we are expected to help out our family members in times of need. This value is evident in the way we celebrate important occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and other significant milestones. It is common for families to come together and celebrate these events with great enthusiasm, showcasing the unity and love that exists within our families.</p><p></p><p>Another significant aspect of Filipino culture is our deep religious faith. Religion plays a significant role in our lives, and it is reflected in our daily practices and beliefs. Our religious values have instilled in us the importance of respect, humility, and compassion towards others. We believe that by being good and living a life according to our faith, we can make the world a better place.</p><p></p><p>Filipino traditions and customs also play a vital role in shaping our identity. For instance, the practice of “bayanihan,” which is a spirit of communal unity and cooperation, is still evident in many rural areas. The concept of “utang na loob,” or a sense of indebtedness to someone who has done you a favor, is another example of how Filipino customs and traditions have shaped our character.</p><p></p><p>However, as a modern Filipino citizen, I also recognize that some aspects of our culture may not be applicable or appropriate in the modern world. For example, some traditional gender roles may not be suitable in today's society, and there is a need to promote gender equality and respect for diversity.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, Filipino values, culture, and traditions have had a significant influence on who we are as a people. As a Filipino citizen, I am proud of our rich culture and traditions, but I also recognize the need to adapt and adjust to the changing times. We need to embrace the positive aspects of our culture and traditions while also being open to change and progress. By doing so, we can continue to uphold our identity as a people and make a positive contribution to the world.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            3. Write a Reflective Essay about Filipino Values, Culture and Tradition that affects modern influence of today as a Filipino Citizen.​</h2><br />
                        <p> As a Filipino citizen, I have been exposed to the values, culture and traditions of my country since I was a child. Growing up in the Philippines has shaped me into the person I am today and has had a profound influence on my life. </p><p></p><p>The Filipino culture is one that is deeply rooted in respect for elders, family values and strong religious beliefs. Respect for elders is an important part of our culture; it is expected that children will show respect to their parents and other adults in their lives. This value has been instilled in me from an early age, teaching me to be respectful of those around me regardless of age or status. </p><p></p><p>Family values are also highly valued within Filipino culture; family members are expected to look out for each other’s well-being and support one another through difficult times. This value has taught me the importance of being there for my loved ones when they need it most, as well as how to be supportive even when things get tough. </p><p></p><p>Religion plays an important role in Filipino culture; many Filipinos practice Catholicism or some form of Christianity which influences our daily lives greatly. This value has taught me about faithfulness and humility, as well as how to live according to God’s will rather than my own desires or ambitions. It also serves as a reminder that no matter what happens in life, God will always be there with us if we turn towards Him with faith and trust Him with our lives. </p><p></p><p>These traditional values have had a great impact on modern society here in the Philippines; they serve as reminders that we should always strive towards being better people by respecting others regardless of age or status, looking out for our loved ones during difficult times and living according to God’s will rather than our own desires or ambitions. These values have helped shape who I am today by teaching me valuable lessons about life which I carry with me wherever I go – something which makes me proud to call myself a Filipino citizen!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong, pa brainliest nmn</p>Here, take a look at the pictures above. hope it helps ^-^]✓<p></p><br />
