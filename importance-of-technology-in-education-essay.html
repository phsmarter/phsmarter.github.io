Writeyour answer on the blank.As our world recognizes increased globalization, 21st century learning refers to the skills and technologies that will position our students to succeed in a world that ever increasingly requires collaboration, critical thinking, adaptability, grit, perseverance and relies less on the learning of facts and data. The how and why of learning becomes central and is far more important than the what or who from past models. Students must approach lifelong learning with a flexible mindset as they tackle 21st century issues. They must learn to work with and listen to a variety of points of view.Technology plays a big part in 21st century learning. The use of podcasts, audio and video blogs and online learning all play into how education is moving and is significant in high schools and universities. The Internet is the connection to our global world. Students will acquire internet navigation skills as they move through our program. The vast array of resources on the Internet provides a wealth of data and students will learn to filter the essential from the nonessential; to incorporate visual images and graphics. The use of the interactive White Board is a valuable classroom tool. Students will have facility with iPads and laptop computers.

                                            Essay 1: Importance of Education Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training it can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check-ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards   SUMMARIZES​</a>

The how and why of learning becomes central and is far more important than the what or who from past models. Students must approach lifelong learning with a flexible mindset as they tackle 21st century issues. They must learn to work with and listen to a variety of points of view.Technology plays a big part in 21st century learning. The use of podcasts, audio and video blogs and online learning all play into how education is moving and is significant in high schools and universities. The Internet is the connection to our global world. Students will acquire internet navigation skills as they move through our program. The vast array of resources on the Internet provides a wealth of data and students will learn to filter the essential from the nonessential; to incorporate visual images and graphics. The use of the interactive White Board is a valuable classroom tool. Students will have facility with iPads and laptop computers.
