                        <strong>How do you see yourself 10 years from now? </strong><p></p><p>Like many others, I have a <strong>goal </strong>that I must attain no matter how difficult the circumstances are. Actually, my well-wishers believe that the objectives that I hold dear are unrealistic, thus I need to have a backup plan in the form of <strong>goals</strong>. You know, according to society, unrealistic ambitions or dreams are also necessary since they help you evolve into a better person. They may not be monetarily beneficial, but they are our ideal <strong>goals</strong>. So, like all of my pals, I have a realistic <strong>goal </strong>that can be accomplished via hard work and devotion while still allowing me to partake in all of life's material pleasures.</p><p>My <strong>goal </strong>is to raise awareness about vegetarianism, a healthy lifestyle, and living in a sustainable manner. I am a vegetarian, and I wish to raise public awareness about the advantages of eating this way. Nowadays, keeping vegetarian is difficult because there are so many temptations, such as peer pressure, that draw you in that direction. I'm not suggesting that being a non-vegetarian is terrible, but vegetarian diets, in my opinion, are natural meals that help us reach our aim of keeping healthy. I am also a fan of zero waste and minimal consumption, which I believe is an important aspect of caring for our mother. I'd also like to do something positive for the environment.</p><p></p><p>How do you see yourself 10 years from now? brainly.ph/question/2157417</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
