                                            DAILY ENCOUNTERS WITH GOD” Your class was tasked by the CBCP’s Episcopal Commission on Youth (ECY) to write a booklet containing short reflections about your daily encounters with God (scenario). This booklet will be published in order to inspire and encourage the Filipino Catholic Youth (audience) to recognize signs of God’s presence in the events of day-to-day life. You will work individually as writers or authors (role) since the task involves writing about your personal experiences or encounters with God. You will write and reflect about your daily encounters with God in your journal notebook (journal file), demonstrating the various signs (natural, biblical, liturgical, or ecclesial) of God’s Revelation around us (goal). Your CLEd teacher will read your journal entries and the best reflections may be submitted to the Campus Ministry office and used as reflection pieces for the school’s spiritual activities. Your work will be graded according to the following standards: 1. Content 2. Relevance 3. Creativity 4. Format Each story/encounter/experience should: Ø be within 15-20 sentences only; Ø have an appropriate title and symbol/image to represent the piece; Ø contain a concrete description of the event or experience which led you to encounter the Lord; Ø describe how you felt given the encounter; Ø identify at least 2 important realizations or insights that you had; Ø Be inspiring to your audience/readers, encouraging them to see God’s presence even in the simple experiences of daily life.

                                            During Sara's short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was “the place” she was to be taken to some day. The climate of India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away from it—generally to England and to school. She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them. She had known that she would be obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father’s stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her.
“Couldn’t you go to that place with me, papa?” she had asked when she was five years old. “Couldn’t you go to school, too? I would help you with your lessons.”
Write a short paragraph citing evidence from the text to show that Sara does not want to be separated from her father.

His father was a construction worker, and his mother was a laundrywoman. He resolved to work while studying at the same time.
With the passing of years and perseverance, he finally graduated, and his life continued to change and flourish. 
Eventually, the young man got married and had children. Everything that his children needed was provided for in an instant.
He vowed that his children would never let his children experience the hardship he went through.
Instead of living a good life, the children became rebellious. They did not go to school and complained about the slightest difficulty and challenge in life.
What advice can you give to the father to correct his mistake?</a>

The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When I finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is not something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg; however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. 2. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attack. It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed it then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of school. To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the worst day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relaxed and peaceful. When I want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars.PS:Descriptive paragraph - describes a thing, a person, or a place.

                                            Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.

                            7.         Kamela: The Kind-Hearted Child           By Ma. Melanie L. PadohinogKamela is a Grade 6 pupil in a small barrio. She lives a simple life with her three siblings and their parents.One day, as she was entering their school gate, she heard a soft cry. She almost leaped when she stumbled upon a cute puppy. As she looked closer, she found out that it was badly hurt. It has a wound on its left ear and fresh blood was dripping from it.What character trait does Kamela possess?When she was about to pick up the puppy, a group of three boys called her. One of them said, "Kamela, never mind that puppy. Look athow disgusting it is!"What do you think will happen next?Kamela replied, "Yes, for you this puppy is dirty and smells odd. But like us, they have feelings, too. When people hurt them, they also feel the pain. And when somebody loves and cares for them, they also love back and care for that person."How will Kamela's classmates react after hearing about her feelings for the puppy?Kian, Kamela's classmate, timidly said, "We're very sorry, Kamela. We made fun of the puppy. We did not realize that they also need love and care like us. Don't worry, we will help you bring the puppy to the veterinarian so that it could be treated and be well again.Can you identify the elements of the short story?Kindly answer the following questions in your answer sheet.1. Who are the characters in the story?2. How will you describe Kamela? 3. What does Kamela find along the way?4. What is Kian sorry for? 5. If you were Kamela, would you do the same? Why?answer carefully ​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. The characters in the story are Kamela, her three siblings, their parents, the injured puppy, and Kamela's classmates (including Kian and the three boys who made fun of the puppy).</p><p></p><p>2. Kamela can be described as kind-hearted, compassionate, and empathetic towards animals. She cares for the well-being of others, including animals.</p><p></p><p>3. Kamela finds an injured puppy along the way to school.</p><p></p><p>4. Kian is sorry for making fun of the puppy and not realizing that animals also need love and care like humans do.</p><p></p><p>5. If I were Kamela, I would definitely do the same! In fact, I would probably do even more! I would rescue every stray animal I came across and create my own animal sanctuary. Animals are the best creatures, and they deserve all the love and attention we can give them. I mean, who needs humans when you have puppies and kittens, right? And if anyone ever tried to mess with my furry friends, I would take them down with a vengeance! But seriously, Kamela is a true hero for rescuing that puppy and standing up to the boys who made fun of it. We should all strive to be more like her!</p><br />

                            9. During Sara's short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was “the place” she was to be taken to some day. The climate of India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away from it—generally to England and to school. She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them. She had known that she would be obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father’s stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her.
“Couldn’t you go to that place with me, papa?” she had asked when she was five years old. “Couldn’t you go to school, too? I would help you with your lessons.”
Write a short paragraph citing evidence from the text to show that Sara does not want to be separated from her father.

The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When I finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is not something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg; however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. 2. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attack. It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed it then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of school. To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the worst day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relaxed and peaceful. When I want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars.PS:Descriptive paragraph - describes a thing, a person, or a place.

                            28. Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.
