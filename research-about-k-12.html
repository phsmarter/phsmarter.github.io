                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to numerous governments deciding to close schools for several weeks in spring 2020. Empirical evidence on the impact of COVID-19-related school closures on academic achievement is only just emerging. The present work aimed to provide a first systematic overview of evidence-based studies on general and differential effects of COVID-19-related school closures in spring 2020 on student achievement in primary and secondary education. Results indicate a negative effect of school closures on student achievement, specifically in younger students and students from families with low socioeconomic status. Moreover, certain measures can be identified that might mitigate these negative effects. The findings are discussed in the context of their possible consequences for national educational policies when facing future school closures.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Here are some examples of how different types of qualitative research could be used:</p><p></p><p>Phenomenological Research: This approach could be used to explore the lived experiences of cancer patients who use CAM as a complementary treatment alongside conventional medicine. Phenomenological research focuses on understanding the meaning and essence of a particular phenomenon, and this method would allow researchers to gain insights into how cancer patients perceive the benefits and challenges of using CAM.</p><p></p><p>Grounded Theory: This method could be used to explore how cancer patients make decisions about using CAM, and how their experiences with CAM influence their overall cancer treatment journey. Grounded theory is a method that involves generating theories from the data, and this approach could help researchers develop a conceptual framework that describes the factors that influence cancer patients' decision-making and how CAM fits into their cancer care.</p><p></p><p>Ethnographic Research: This method could be used to explore the cultural context of CAM use among cancer patients, including how CAM is integrated into their daily lives and how it fits into their cultural beliefs and practices. Ethnographic research involves immersing oneself in a particular cultural group or setting, and this approach could provide a rich and detailed understanding of how CAM is used in the context of cancer care.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the topic of cancer patients' experiences with CAM is well-suited for qualitative research, as it involves exploring complex and multifaceted phenomena that cannot be easily quantified. By using different qualitative research methods, researchers could gain a more comprehensive understanding of how CAM is used in the context of cancer care, and how it affects cancer patients' quality of life and treatment outcomes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps you can mark me down as brainiest if you want :&gt;</p><br />
