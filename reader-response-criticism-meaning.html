                                            Typical Questions to be Asked when Reading as Reader-Response Critic • How does the interaction of text and reader create meaning? • What does a phrase-by-phrase analysis of a short literary text, or a key portion of a longer text, tell us about the reading experience pre- structured by (built into) that text? Do the sounds/shapes of the words as they appear on the page or how they are spoken by the reader enhance or change the meaning of the word/work? • How might we interpret a literary text to show that the reader's response is, or is analogous to, the topic of the story? What does the body of criticism published about a literary text suggest about the critics who interpreted that text and/or about the reading experience produced by that text? (Tyson 191)​</a>

                            29. Typical Questions to be Asked when Reading as Reader-Response Critic • How does the interaction of text and reader create meaning? • What does a phrase-by-phrase analysis of a short literary text, or a key portion of a longer text, tell us about the reading experience pre- structured by (built into) that text? Do the sounds/shapes of the words as they appear on the page or how they are spoken by the reader enhance or change the meaning of the word/work? • How might we interpret a literary text to show that the reader's response is, or is analogous to, the topic of the story? What does the body of criticism published about a literary text suggest about the critics who interpreted that text and/or about the reading experience produced by that text? (Tyson 191)​</h2><br />
                        Reader response Criticism<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Water. Earth. Fire. Air.Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.<br />
