I've been on the Mountaintop by: Dr. Martin Luther The world is changing and anyone who thinks he can live alone in this world is sleeping through a revolution... We must learn to live together as brothers or we shall perish together as fools. Racial injustice is still the black man's burden and the white man's shame. The government must certainly share the guilt, the individual must share the guilt, and even the church must share the guilt. I have been receiving threats on my life...or warnings about what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers. I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop, and I no longer mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life; longevity has its grace. But I am not concemed about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He has allowed me to go up to the mountain." And I've looked over, sand I've seen the promised land." I may not get there with you, but I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to that promised land.: I am not worried about anything. I am not fearing any man.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

I've been on the Mountaintop by: Dr. Martin Luther The world is changing and anyone who thinks he can live alone in this world is sleeping through a revolution... We must learn to live together as brothers or we shall perish together as fools. Racial injustice is still the black man's burden and the white man's shame. The government must certainly share the guilt, the individual must share the guilt, and even the church must share the guilt. I have been receiving threats on my life...or warnings about what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers. I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop, and I no longer mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life; longevity has its grace. But I am not concemed about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He has allowed me to go up to the mountain." And I've looked over, sand I've seen the promised land." I may not get there with you, but I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to that promised land.: I am not worried about anything. I am not fearing any man. For "mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!" Source: Galindo, H. C. &amp; Victoria Jr, M. (2019). English bime Third quarter, 23 (3), 68.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                            21. When describing something, we often resort to making comparisons to establish a clearer idea of what we are trying to describe or explain. There are many types of comparisons in the English language including the use of figures of speech like simile and metaphor. This lesson focuses on the use of other rhetorical devices like analogy in comparing things in order to describe or make a point. What can you say about a tree? Can a tree be associated to life? NG EDUK IMD How will you relate life to a tree? Give at least five (5) concepts that will show the relationship between the two. Present your answers to your parents and/or guardians. Ask them to share their opinions about your answers.​</h2><br />
                        <p>An analogy is a type of comparison that shows how two things that are seemingly unrelated have some common qualities or features. An analogy is often used to explain complex ideas or concepts by showing their similarity to something that is more familiar or easier to understand.</p><p></p><p>One way to think of a tree is as a metaphor for life. Trees and life have several things in common: both grow and change over time, both have a beginning and an end, and both are made up of many different parts that work together to support the whole.</p><p></p><p>Here are five concepts that show the relationship between a tree and life:</p><p></p><p>Growth: Just like a tree grows from a small seed into a tall, strong plant, life begins with a small, fragile being (a baby) and grows into a mature, capable adult.</p><p></p><p>Change: Trees go through many changes as they grow, shedding their leaves in the fall, blooming in the spring, and adapting to their environment. Life is also full of change, as we experience different stages and challenges throughout our lives.</p><p></p><p>Unity: A tree is made up of many different parts - roots, trunk, branches, leaves - that all work together to support the tree as a whole. Similarly, life is made up of many different aspects - physical, emotional, mental, spiritual - that all work together to support the person as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Variety: Trees come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors, and each one has its own unique characteristics. Life is also full of variety, with each person having their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and experiences.</p><p></p><p>Connection: Trees are connected to each other and to the earth through their roots, and they depend on each other for support and nourishment. In the same way, life is interconnected, with each person depending on others for support and nourishment, and contributing to the well-being of the whole.</p><p></p><p>By using these concepts, we can see how a tree can be an analogy for life, showing the many ways in which the two are similar. When presenting these ideas to your parents or guardians, you can ask for their opinions and thoughts on the relationship between a tree and life, and see if they have any additional ideas or insights to share.</p><br />
