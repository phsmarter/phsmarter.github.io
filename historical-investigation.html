Historical approach seeks to understand a literary work by investigatingthe social, cultural, and intellectual context that produced it.2. Historical approach is one of the latest approaches in literary analysis.3. Historical approach usually helps the critic and readers to understand allof the events and forces that might affect the author as he or she is composing thework, and this gives us a more comprehensive understanding to the work itself.4. Historical research does not involve the careful study and analysis of dataabout past events.5. Historical Approach does not include critical investigation of events, theirdevelopment, experiences of past6. Reeder-response is a literary theory that discusses the important role of theauthor to unlock the meaning of the text.7. Examining, explaining, and defending one's personal reaction to a text arethe purposes of reader-response theory,8. Criticisms using reader-response theory should be based from theprinciples and form of the text/material itself.9. Connecting with the text is the biggest challenge in using reader-responsetheory.10. Reader response criticism primarily focuses on the author or the contentand form of the work.​</a>

                            6. LITERARY JOURNALISM ASSIGNMENT Your task is to investigate a current or historical event, person, place, or thing and write about it in a creative way. The requirements are as follows: 1. Investigate a person, place, thing, or event through real-world, actionable strategies such as interviewing or under cover tactics, in addition to traditional research methods. 2. Document your investigation. 3. Tell the story.  4. Use literary techniques in your telling. ​</h2><br />
                        For my literary journalism assignment, I decided to investigate the rise of plant-based diets and the impact they are having on the food industry. I began by conducting interviews with individuals who have adopted plant-based diets, as well as chefs and food industry experts who are incorporating more plant-based options into their menus.<br /><br />Through my investigation, I discovered that the reasons for adopting plant-based diets vary widely, from concerns about animal welfare to environmental sustainability and health benefits. I also found that the food industry is responding to this trend by offering more plant-based options, both in restaurants and in grocery stores.<br /><br />To tell the story of this trend, I used literary techniques such as imagery and metaphor. For example, I described the variety of colorful fruits and vegetables available in a farmer's market as a "rainbow of flavors," and likened the plant-based movement to a "green revolution" in the food industry.<br /><br />Overall, my investigation revealed that the rise of plant-based diets is not just a passing trend, but a growing movement with far-reaching implications for the food industry and our society as a whole. By using literary techniques to tell this story, I hope to engage readers and inspire them to think more critically about their own food choices.<br />
