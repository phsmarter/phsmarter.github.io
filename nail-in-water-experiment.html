Direction: Put on the blank space the type of Text shown in each item.The world's biggest health crisis of our time is the rise of corona virus pandemic that not only threatens people but kill thousands of lives around the globe. It originates in Wuhan china last 2019 and is a highly contagious disease that easily spread around the world.1. Type of Text:___________________COVID-19 is a virus that looks like a corona that can easily transferred by humans through sneezing or coughing. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.2. Type of Text:___________________The three well known coronaviruses are first, the MERS-CoV (the beta  coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS). Second is SARS- and the third one SARS-CoV-2 (the novel  coronavirus that causes  coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19) which we are currently facing today. 3. Type of Text: _______________First prepare all the ingredients needed in cooking chicken adobo. Then marinate it for 30 minutes. Drain and reserve marinade. After it fry chicken in oil until golden brown. Lastly, combine chicken with marinade then simmer until chicken is tender. Finally add Del Monte Pineapple tidbits and top with fried garlic. 4. Type of Text:_____________ As Earth rotates on its axis, around the Sun. the section facing the sun will be the daylight. The section facing away the sun will be in darkness, experiencing night. One half of the Earth is always experiencing day while the other half is experiencing night. 5. Type of Text:_____________ If oxygen is present in a wet material with iron, such as a nail or steel bar, the formation of rust occurs. It only happens when iron, oxygen, and water react with one another. Rust occurs when iron or alloys such as steel corrode, thus rusting is commonly known as iron or steel corrosion. 6. Type of Text:_____________Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two. 7. Type of Text:_______________ In this module you will learn to: 1. tell what word blending is; 2. infer the meaning of blended words based on given context clues (synonyms, antonyms, word parts, and other strategies; and 3. appreciate the new learning on blended words. 8. Type of Text:______________ In inferring or "guessing" the meaning of unfamiliar blended words, you can look for context clues in the  sentence where the blended word is used. Context clues are hints that a writer provides to help the readers get the meaning of a difficult or unusual word in a sentence. 9. Type of Text:_______________Some changes in matter may result in negative effects like pollution, destruction of habitat, and loss of lives. Improper disposal of garbage, harmful chemicals and human waste can cause changes. It can pollute air, land and water.10. Type of Text:_________________​</a>

Direction: Put on the blank space the type of Text shown in each item.The world's biggest health crisis of our time is the rise of corona virus pandemic that not only threatens people but kill thousands of lives around the globe. It originates in Wuhan china last 2019 and is a highly contagious disease that easily spread around the world.1. Type of Text:___________________COVID-19 is a virus that looks like a corona that can easily transferred by humans through sneezing or coughing. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.2. Type of Text:___________________The three well known coronaviruses are first, the MERS-CoV (the beta  coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS). Second is SARS- and the third one SARS-CoV-2 (the novel  coronavirus that causes  coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19) which we are currently facing today. 3. Type of Text: _______________First prepare all the ingredients needed in cooking chicken adobo. Then marinate it for 30 minutes. Drain and reserve marinade. After it fry chicken in oil until golden brown. Lastly, combine chicken with marinade then simmer until chicken is tender. Finally add Del Monte Pineapple tidbits and top with fried garlic. 4. Type of Text:_____________ As Earth rotates on its axis, around the Sun. the section facing the sun will be the daylight. The section facing away the sun will be in darkness, experiencing night. One half of the Earth is always experiencing day while the other half is experiencing night. 5. Type of Text:_____________ If oxygen is present in a wet material with iron, such as a nail or steel bar, the formation of rust occurs. It only happens when iron, oxygen, and water react with one another. Rust occurs when iron or alloys such as steel corrode, thus rusting is commonly known as iron or steel corrosion. 6. Type of Text:_____________Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two. 7. Type of Text:_______________ In this module you will learn to: 1. tell what word blending is; 2. infer the meaning of blended words based on given context clues (synonyms, antonyms, word parts, and other strategies; and 3. appreciate the new learning on blended words. 8. Type of Text:______________ In inferring or "guessing" the meaning of unfamiliar blended words, you can look for context clues in the  sentence where the blended word is used. Context clues are hints that a writer provides to help the readers get the meaning of a difficult or unusual word in a sentence. 9. Type of Text:_______________Some changes in matter may result in negative effects like pollution, destruction of habitat, and loss of lives. Improper disposal of garbage, harmful chemicals and human waste can cause changes. It can pollute air, land and water.10. Type of Text:_________________​</h2><br />
