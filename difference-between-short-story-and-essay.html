                                            Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>"Old Man at the Bridge" is a short story by Ernest Hemingway that takes place during the Spanish Civil War. It follows an old man who is displaced and exhausted from the war and has stopped at a bridge as he makes his way to safety. A soldier passing through stops to talk to him and realizes that the old man's goats have died, leaving him with nothing to do but wait for his own inevitable death.</p><p></p><p>The characters in the story are:</p><p></p><p>The old man</p><p>The soldier</p><p>The setting is a bridge over a river during the Spanish Civil War.</p><p></p><p>The plot centers around the interaction between the old man and the soldier as they discuss the old man's situation and the soldier's duty to continue on with the war. The central conflict is the old man's resignation to his fate and the soldier's realization that there is nothing he can do to help him.</p><p></p><p>The theme of the story is the senselessness of war and the human cost of conflict.</p><p></p><p>How does the seemingly small incident described in the story reveal a </p><p>significant truth about life?</p><p></p><p>The seemingly small incident of the old man's resignation reveals the significant truth that war not only takes a physical toll on those involved but also a psychological one, leaving its victims hopeless and despondent.</p><p></p><p>Which of the characters’ observations rings most true to you? Select one from the story, and read the observation aloud to the group.</p><p></p><p>One of the characters' observations that rings most true is the soldier's realization that "this was an example of something." He recognizes that the old man's situation is not unique and that there are likely many others like him in the war-torn country.</p><p></p><p>Do you think the old man is a simple or a more complex character? Explain.</p><p></p><p>The old man is a complex character as his resignation is juxtaposed with his determination to make it to safety, showing that he is both resigned to his fate but also fighting to survive.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Explain the difference between a short story to a poem, a drama, and an essay.</p><p></p><p>A short story is a work of fiction that tells a complete story in a condensed format, typically under 10,000 words. A poem is a work of literature that uses language to evoke emotions and imagery in a condensed and rhythmic form. A drama is a work of literature that is meant to be performed, typically on stage, and includes dialogue and stage directions. An essay is a work of non-fiction that presents an argument or explores a topic in an organized and structured format.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Old Man at the Bridge" is a short story written by Ernest Hemingway. It is set during the Spanish Civil War and revolves around an old man who is forced to leave his home due to the war. As he sits by the side of the road, he is discovered by a soldier who stops to talk to him. The old man tells the soldier about his situation and expresses his fear that he will not be able to make it to safety before the enemy arrives.</p><p></p><p>The story's characters include the old man, who is described as "emaciated" and "frightened," and the soldier, who is kind and sympathetic towards the old man. The setting is a dusty road near the Ebro River in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.</p><p></p><p>The plot of the story revolves around the conversation between the old man and the soldier, during which the old man expresses his fear and the soldier attempts to reassure him. The central conflict is the old man's fear of not being able to reach safety before the enemy arrives.</p><p></p><p>The theme of the story is the fragility of life and the human experience of facing death. The story reveals a significant truth about life in that even the most seemingly insignificant individuals have their own stories and fears, and that the inevitability of death makes all lives equally important.</p><p></p><p>One of the characters' observations that rings true is the soldier's comment that "War is not won by evacuation." This statement highlights the fact that war is not just about military strategy and victory, but also about the impact it has on individuals and their lives.</p><p></p><p>The old man is a complex character, as he is not just a representative of the war's civilian casualties, but also a symbol of the human experience of facing mortality and the fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>A short story is a work of fiction that is typically shorter than a novel, with a focused plot and limited number of characters. It differs from a poem in that it is prose rather than verse, and from a drama in that it is not intended to be performed. An essay is a nonfiction work that explores a topic or idea, typically in a more structured and analytical format than a short story</p><br />

                            19. Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A paragraph is a group of related sentences that support one main idea. In general, paragraphs consist of three parts: the topic sentence, body sentences, and the concluding or the bridge sentence to the next paragraph or section. Paragraphs show where the subdivisions of a research paper begin and end and, thus, help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>kaya mo po yan <p> </p>I need somebody who can love me in my worsr<br />
