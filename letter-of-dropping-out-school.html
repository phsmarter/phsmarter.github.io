1. It seemed like an ordinary day when she got up that morning, but tynda was about to embark on the
worst day of her life. First, she fell in the bathtub because her mother forgot to rinse out the bath oil.
Then she spilled orange juice on the outfit she had spent hours putting together for school pictures.
When she changed, she messed up the French braid her mother had put in her hair. As she walked out
the door, she dropped all of her school books and her math homework flew away. Once she made it to
the car she thought everything would be all right. She was wrong; her father didn't look before he
backed out of the driveway and ran into the neighbor's truck. Lynda's side of the car was damaged the
most, and she ended up with a broken arm. That night, she cried herself to sleep.

b. enumeration
c. time order
2. The first step in redesigning your closet is take everything out and sort through it. Anything you
haven't worn in over a year should be given to charity. Check garments for wear and tear. Take care of
anything that needs mending. If it is beyond repair, get rid of it. The second step is to install a closet
organizer. Choose one that will hold the different types of garments in your wardrobe. The third step is
to put items in the closet so that those you wear most often are easy to access. The final step is to stay
organized. Put garments back in their appropriate places so that you will be able to find them.

Despite that poor performance, I managed topass the exams and get a place in an agricultural college. However, I dropped out after the firstterm because I had not been doing any work. After that, working in a factory seemed, at first,to be a good option. I had my own money and some good friends. I was happy, or so I thought.But this idea kept nagging at me that I could do better. I would spend my evenings reading andone day I just thought I need to get qualified. Studying at home was perfect because I did notneed to give up my job. It was hard work being a student and holding down a full-time job, butit got me where I wanted to go - to university. Finally, I gained my degree almost exactly twentyyears after I'd first left school. A little late, but never mind!1. took a distance learning course2. graduated from university3. failed most of his GCSES4. worked in industry5. went to agricultural college​</a>

worst day of her life. First, she fell in the bathtub because her mother forgot to rinse out the bath oil.
Then she spilled orange juice on the outfit she had spent hours putting together for school pictures.
When she changed, she messed up the French braid her mother had put in her hair. As she walked out
the door, she dropped all of her school books and her math homework flew away. Once she made it to
the car she thought everything would be all right. She was wrong; her father didn't look before he
backed out of the driveway and ran into the neighbor's truck. Lynda's side of the car was damaged the
most, and she ended up with a broken arm. That night, she cried herself to sleep.

2. The first step in redesigning your closet is take everything out and sort through it. Anything you
haven't worn in over a year should be given to charity. Check garments for wear and tear. Take care of
anything that needs mending. If it is beyond repair, get rid of it. The second step is to install a closet
organizer. Choose one that will hold the different types of garments in your wardrobe. The third step is
to put items in the closet so that those you wear most often are easy to access. The final step is to stay
organized. Put garments back in their appropriate places so that you will be able to find them.
What is the purpose of the text?
a. How to give clothes to charity
b. How to redesign your closet
c. To list down the garments for wear and tear</h2><br />
