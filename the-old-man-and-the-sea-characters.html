                                            Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                                            The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</a>

                                            n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                                            ME GORGON'S HEAD Anne Terry White Acrisius, King of Argos, came home from Delphi with a heavy heart, for he had received a dreadful oracle that he will not have a son but a grandson who in the future will be the cause of his death. Frightened and to evade from his fate, King Acrisius hid Danae, his only daughter from the sight of men and locked her up inside a house of bronze sunk underground. But part of the roof of the house was open to the sky and Zeus saw lovely Danae and he stormed into the chamber in the form of a shower of gold. He appeared in front of Danae and in an instant Danae conceived a baby. Days after, Danae gave birth to a baby boy named Perseus. She kept her baby a secret from her father, but days have come, and King Acrisius learned about the secret. He built a great chest and placed Danae and her child in it and set them adrift upon the sea. All days and all nights the chest tossed upon the waves until it reached the Island of Seraphos where a fisherman named Dictys, saw the chest and took it, he opened it, and saw Danae and her child. When he beheld the pitiful mother with the helpless little child, his heart was moved. He took them both to his wife, for Dictys was childless and there in the kindly fisherfolk's humble home Perseus grew up. Polydectes, Dictys brother was captivated by Danae's beauty and made her his wife. King Plydectes got jealous over the love of Danae to Perseus and sought some ways to get rid of him. Polydectes sent Perseus to a dangerous adventure that put his life in peril. The adventure was to kill Medusa, one of the three Gorgons, who has a venomous snaky-haired and metal-scaled skin. Looking straight in the eye of Medusa can turn mortals into stone. Despite the dangers, he is facing, Perseus set off to find Medusa and agreed to fulfill his mission just to get his own name of glory. Hermes gave him a sword and Athena gave him a shield. Perseus was also told by Hermes to have the three essential things, the winged sandals, the magic wallet, and the helmet of invisibility which are all in the possession of the Nymphs of the North and to get there, Perseus has to go first to the Gray Women. He snatched the eye of the women and threatened not to return it unless they gave him the direction going to the Nymphs of the North. the reason why she was chained on the cliff. It was a revenge for her mother because her mother boasted that she is most beautiful than 50 lovely daughters of Nereus. Andromeda suffered the punishment and at any time the serpent will devour her. Perseus told Andromeda's parents that he would save their daughter with the condition that he would marry her. The king and queen agreed and Andromeda was saved from death. He brought Andromeda to his homeland, which at that time, games were being held at Larissa, Perseus upon hearing take part in the discus throw competition and when it was his turn to throw the discus, he threw and accidentally hit and killed an old man in the crowd. The old man was King Acrisius, his grandfather. Fully equipped and with the direction given, Perseus headed to the fearful island of the Gorgons. As he approached, he could see scattered in the fields, along the roads, statues of men and beasts whom the sight of Gorgons had turned into stone. For him to identify who is Medusa among the three, he was instructed by Athena that Medusa was the one closest to the shore. Perseus beheaded Medusa with one swift of his sword and with the help of his shield as mirror. He put Medusa's head inside a magic wallet. On his way home, Perseus noticed a beautiful maiden fastened by chains to a cliff by the sea. He asked the maiden's name and why she was hanged. The woman answered that she was Andromeda, the daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassipoeia. Andromeda told Perseus that her mother is ACTIVITY 3 Directions: Compare &amp; contrast the characters from the story by making a venn diagram. Choose only two characters. Use ½ manila paper.

Directions: This week you read Hemingway's The Old Man &amp; the Sea and examined it for character archetypes. Your job now is to write an analytical paragraph about a character archetype you see represented by one of the characters in the book. You will need to use: topic sentences; context; evidence; reasoning/analysis. 
criteria: Your paragraph has a topic sentence (says what the paragraph is talking about/which character archetype Hemingway uses to move the story forward)
Your paragraph has context (defines which archetype you’re discussing AND who the character you’re writing about is AND what they are doing in the book prior to your text evidence)
Your paragraph has evidence (a direct quote from the play WITH citation) (Looks like: Hemingway, pg number) (ex: Hemingway 35) 
Your paragraph has analysis (how your evidence supports your topic sentence/how the character represents the archetype you chose)</a>

                                            TEXT A He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fisherman, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motor-boats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man ALWAYS thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought. The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway.  1.

                            7. Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                            11. The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</h2><br />

                            14. n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                            21. ME GORGON'S HEAD Anne Terry White Acrisius, King of Argos, came home from Delphi with a heavy heart, for he had received a dreadful oracle that he will not have a son but a grandson who in the future will be the cause of his death. Frightened and to evade from his fate, King Acrisius hid Danae, his only daughter from the sight of men and locked her up inside a house of bronze sunk underground. But part of the roof of the house was open to the sky and Zeus saw lovely Danae and he stormed into the chamber in the form of a shower of gold. He appeared in front of Danae and in an instant Danae conceived a baby. Days after, Danae gave birth to a baby boy named Perseus. She kept her baby a secret from her father, but days have come, and King Acrisius learned about the secret. He built a great chest and placed Danae and her child in it and set them adrift upon the sea. All days and all nights the chest tossed upon the waves until it reached the Island of Seraphos where a fisherman named Dictys, saw the chest and took it, he opened it, and saw Danae and her child. When he beheld the pitiful mother with the helpless little child, his heart was moved. He took them both to his wife, for Dictys was childless and there in the kindly fisherfolk's humble home Perseus grew up. Polydectes, Dictys brother was captivated by Danae's beauty and made her his wife. King Plydectes got jealous over the love of Danae to Perseus and sought some ways to get rid of him. Polydectes sent Perseus to a dangerous adventure that put his life in peril. The adventure was to kill Medusa, one of the three Gorgons, who has a venomous snaky-haired and metal-scaled skin. Looking straight in the eye of Medusa can turn mortals into stone. Despite the dangers, he is facing, Perseus set off to find Medusa and agreed to fulfill his mission just to get his own name of glory. Hermes gave him a sword and Athena gave him a shield. Perseus was also told by Hermes to have the three essential things, the winged sandals, the magic wallet, and the helmet of invisibility which are all in the possession of the Nymphs of the North and to get there, Perseus has to go first to the Gray Women. He snatched the eye of the women and threatened not to return it unless they gave him the direction going to the Nymphs of the North. the reason why she was chained on the cliff. It was a revenge for her mother because her mother boasted that she is most beautiful than 50 lovely daughters of Nereus. Andromeda suffered the punishment and at any time the serpent will devour her. Perseus told Andromeda's parents that he would save their daughter with the condition that he would marry her. The king and queen agreed and Andromeda was saved from death. He brought Andromeda to his homeland, which at that time, games were being held at Larissa, Perseus upon hearing take part in the discus throw competition and when it was his turn to throw the discus, he threw and accidentally hit and killed an old man in the crowd. The old man was King Acrisius, his grandfather. Fully equipped and with the direction given, Perseus headed to the fearful island of the Gorgons. As he approached, he could see scattered in the fields, along the roads, statues of men and beasts whom the sight of Gorgons had turned into stone. For him to identify who is Medusa among the three, he was instructed by Athena that Medusa was the one closest to the shore. Perseus beheaded Medusa with one swift of his sword and with the help of his shield as mirror. He put Medusa's head inside a magic wallet. On his way home, Perseus noticed a beautiful maiden fastened by chains to a cliff by the sea. He asked the maiden's name and why she was hanged. The woman answered that she was Andromeda, the daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassipoeia. Andromeda told Perseus that her mother is ACTIVITY 3 Directions: Compare &amp; contrast the characters from the story by making a venn diagram. Choose only two characters. Use ½ manila paper.

Directions: This week you read Hemingway's The Old Man &amp; the Sea and examined it for character archetypes. Your job now is to write an analytical paragraph about a character archetype you see represented by one of the characters in the book. You will need to use: topic sentences; context; evidence; reasoning/analysis. 
criteria: Your paragraph has a topic sentence (says what the paragraph is talking about/which character archetype Hemingway uses to move the story forward)
Your paragraph has context (defines which archetype you’re discussing AND who the character you’re writing about is AND what they are doing in the book prior to your text evidence)
Your paragraph has evidence (a direct quote from the play WITH citation) (Looks like: Hemingway, pg number) (ex: Hemingway 35) 
Your paragraph has analysis (how your evidence supports your topic sentence/how the character represents the archetype you chose)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea tells the story of Santiago, an aging fisherman who embarks on a journey to catch a giant marlin. Throughout the novel, Santiago exhibits many characteristics of the hero archetype.</p><p></p><p>One aspect of the hero archetype that Santiago embodies is his perseverance and determination. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, Santiago remains undaunted and continues to pursue his goal with unrelenting determination. For example, when the marlin begins to pull Santiago's boat out to sea, he refuses to give up and says, "I'll stay with you until I am dead" (Hemingway, 45). This determination is further demonstrated when Santiago refuses to let go of the marlin's line, even when it becomes clear that he will not be able to bring the fish back to shore.</p><p></p><p>Santiago's heroism is also evident in his willingness to accept the consequences of his actions. Throughout the novel, Santiago is aware that his pursuit of the marlin could result in his death, but he remains committed to his goal despite the risks. This is exemplified when Santiago says, "I would rather be his friend and his greatest enemy than his enemy and not be able to see him" (Hemingway, 48). This willingness to face danger and sacrifice for a higher purpose is a hallmark of the hero archetype.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Santiago's perseverance, determination, and willingness to accept the consequences of his actions make him a compelling example of the hero archetype in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            24. TEXT A He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fisherman, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motor-boats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man ALWAYS thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought. The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway.  1.
