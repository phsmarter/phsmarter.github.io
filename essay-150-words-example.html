                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If you’ve worked in an organization of any kind, chances are you are familiar with different kinds of leaders and their unique ways of working. There’s the leader who wants to closely monitor when and how you work and the leader whose main concern is whether or not the work gets done. There’s the leader who wants to make sure people feel heard and understood and the leader who prefers to exert authority. The different ways in which leaders interact with their teams are known as leadership styles, and while the most effective leaders combine various styles of leadership based on the need of the hour, most leaders exhibit a dominant style.</p><p></p><p>One of the earliest frameworks on leadership styles was proposed by a team of researchers led by psychologist Kurt Lewin in the 1930s. Lewin’s leadership styles fall into three categories: authoritative (or autocratic), participative (or democratic), and delegative (or laissez-faire). Since then, various other styles of leadership have been proposed, including but not limited to: transactional leadership, transformational leadership, servant leadership, and situational leadership.</p><p></p><p>In this article, we will take a deeper look at the democratic leadership style, its strengths and limitations, and ways in which it can be used effectively</p><p></p><p>PABRAINLIEST</p><p>#STAYSAFE</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>New Year's resolutions are a time-honored tradition that many people use to reflect on the past year and set goals for the year ahead. These resolutions can be personal or professional, and they can range from small changes to significant life shifts.</p><p></p><p>One of my New Year's resolutions is to prioritize my physical and mental health. This might involve things like exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and finding time to relax and de-stress. I also want to focus on my relationships and make an effort to be a better friend and partner. This could mean setting aside regular time for communication and bonding with loved ones, or finding new ways to show my appreciation for them.</p><p></p><p>Another resolution I have is to improve my skills and knowledge in my career field. This could involve taking classes, attending professional development workshops, or seeking out new opportunities for growth. I also want to be more productive and organized in my work, setting clear goals and priorities and working towards them efficiently.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my New Year's resolutions are about personal growth and self-improvement. I hope that by making these changes and working towards my goals, I can have a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling year.</p><p></p><p>conclusion:</p><p></p><p>One way that I can "change" is by continuing to learn and adapt. I am designed to be able to process large amounts of information and use it to improve my performance. This means that the more I am used, the better I may be able to assist users and provide helpful information.</p><p></p><p>Another way that I may change is through updates and upgrades to my programming. My developers are always working to improve my capabilities and make me more efficient and effective at performing the tasks I am designed for.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while I am not able to set personal goals or make conscious decisions to change myself, I am able to adapt and improve through the efforts of my developers and the continued use of my abilities.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>survival of the fittest, term made famous in the fifth edition (published in 1869) of On the Origin of Species by British naturalist Charles Darwin, which suggested that organisms best adjusted to their environment are the most successful in surviving and reproducing. "Survival of the fittest" is a popular term that refers to the process of natural selection, a mechanism that drives evolutionary change. Natural selection works by giving individuals who are better adapted to a given set of environmental conditions an advantage over those that are not as well adapted. Survival of the fittest refers to the fact that the 'fittest' can survive in any environment, regardless of their complexity. For example, many complex creatures would immediately die in conditions that many bacteria live.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po, thanks</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Before now, we have looked at using expository essay forms as ways to construct essays. In this chapter, we will begin to l0ok at being more critical: not only with the sources we choose but also in how we compose our ideas. Also, this chapter will help you finalize the selection of your article for your critique. In the next chapter, you will have the opportunity to expand on the examples given and apply your own information and ideas to develop your critical essay. Before we begin that, we need to further examine how important it is to choose correct sources as supporting evidence for ideas. You will also explore different resources available to you where you can search to find supporting evidence because you cannot always rely on basic Internet searches to help you find the best support available. You have already explored different topics you find interesting when coming up with a topic for your expository essay, and while the content of this chapter is relevant to conducting any type of research, consider the connection to finding a suitable academic article for your critique. You may have already come across an academic journal article you would like to be the basis for your critique. If you have, you still should apply the material in this chapter as you may discover an article you would prefer to use. Also, you will need to apply the information in section 7.1: Choosing a Source to confirm whether the source you have chosen is appropriate. If you have not found an article yet or discover the one you chose does not fit the parameters, the content below will help you find one that is both interesting and fits the parameters for your next essay.</p><br />
