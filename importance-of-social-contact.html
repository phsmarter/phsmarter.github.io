                                            Evidence for Effectiveness of Masks Masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of masks is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain.Questions:How do you feel about the text? ____________________________________________________________________2.

                                            What grammatical structures are the uppercased words in the last paragraph that highlight emotion?
Paragraph: The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped life as we know it. Many of us are staying home, avoiding people on the street and changing daily habits, like going to school or work, in ways we never imagined.
While we are changing old behaviors that sometimes may seem inconvenient for us, there are new routines we need to adopt in order to be safe. The habit of wearing a mask is a must whenever we are in a public space.
Messaging on the importance of wearing a mask during the pandemic has at times been CONFUSING. Universal mask use can significantly reduce virus transmission in communities. Masks are not perfect barriers to transmission, and should be combined with other preventative measures such as social distancing, contact tracing and restrictions on large gatherings. These measures aren’t perfect either and could be BAFFLING, but when many imperfect measures are combined at a community level, they can be very effective at slowing transmission and reducing infections.

                            10. Evidence for Effectiveness of Masks Masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of masks is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain.Questions:How do you feel about the text? ____________________________________________________________________2.

It is transmitteewhen one individual talks, sneezes, or coughs producing droplets of saliva containing the COVID-19 vineThese droplets are then inhaled by another person. COVID-19 transmission usually occurs among closecontacts - including family members and healthcare workers. It is therefore important to maintain adistance of more than 1 meter away from any person who has respiratory symptoms.QuestionMy StandAre you in favor of wearing face-mask,face-shield and maintaining socialdistancing especially in public placesin order to prevent from havingCovid-192​</h2><br />

                            23. Evidence for Effectiveness of Masks Masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of masks is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain.​</h2><br />

                            25. What grammatical structures are the uppercased words in the last paragraph that highlight emotion?
Paragraph: The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped life as we know it. Many of us are staying home, avoiding people on the street and changing daily habits, like going to school or work, in ways we never imagined.
While we are changing old behaviors that sometimes may seem inconvenient for us, there are new routines we need to adopt in order to be safe. The habit of wearing a mask is a must whenever we are in a public space.
Messaging on the importance of wearing a mask during the pandemic has at times been CONFUSING. Universal mask use can significantly reduce virus transmission in communities. Masks are not perfect barriers to transmission, and should be combined with other preventative measures such as social distancing, contact tracing and restrictions on large gatherings. These measures aren’t perfect either and could be BAFFLING, but when many imperfect measures are combined at a community level, they can be very effective at slowing transmission and reducing infections.
