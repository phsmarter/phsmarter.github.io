DIGITAL BAYANIHAN AMID COVID-19Experts all over the world believe that to mitigate the effects and end the spread of the Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), all sectors of the society must work hand in hand to fight the deadly virus.It is not the sole responsibility of the government to stop the global pandemic, and it is imperative for people to join in the efforts and collectively stop the virus from further infecting anyone.This rings true in the Philippines, where the spirit of Bayanihan is slowly being revived amid the onslaught of natural and man-made catastrophes that struck the whole country during the first three months of 2020.Various non-government organizations and even individuals have started calling on Filipinos to help in the war against the pandemic, whether it’s through volunteerism or through monetary donations.Donations drives have been launched by various groups to help protect frontline healthcare workers from the virus. These came amid the reported scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPEs) in hospitals.Likewise, groups and individuals are seeking support to fund relief goods for the families that are in need of food and personal hygiene kits, as major cities and provinces and provinces impose in their own community quarantine protocols.There are hundreds of more donations drives that are hundreds of more donations that are happening across the Philippines today, signaling the strong revival of the Filipino culture of Bayanihan—only that with the strict implementation of community quarantines and social distancing protocols, donations are facilitated through mobile phones.Source: globalnation.inquirer.net (posted March 2019) Questions:1.

                                            The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>World War 1:</strong></p><p>Ang Unang Digmaang Pandaigdig o Unang Digmaang Pandaigdig, kadalasang pinaikli bilang WWI o WW1, ay nagsimula noong 28 Hulyo 1914 at natapos noong 11 Nobyembre 1918. Tinukoy ng mga kontemporaryo bilang "Great War", ang mga nag-aaway nito ay kinabibilangan ng karamihan sa Europa, Imperyong Ruso, Estados Unidos, at Imperyong Ottoman, na lumalawak din ang labanan sa Gitnang Silangan, Aprika, at mga bahagi ng Asya. Isa sa mga pinakanakamamatay na salungatan sa kasaysayan, tinatayang 9 na milyong tao ang namatay sa labanan, habang mahigit 5 milyong sibilyan ang namatay dahil sa pananakop ng militar, pambobomba, gutom, at sakit. Milyun-milyong karagdagang pagkamatay ang nagresulta mula sa mga genocide sa loob ng Ottoman Empire at ang pandemya ng trangkaso noong 1918, na pinalala ng paggalaw ng mga manlalaban sa panahon ng digmaan. </p><p></p><p><strong>World </strong><strong>War </strong><strong>II:</strong></p><p>Ang Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig o ang Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig, na kadalasang pinaikli bilang WWII o WW2, ay isang pandaigdigang digmaan na tumagal mula 1939 hanggang 1945. Kasama rito ang karamihan sa mga bansa sa daigdig—kabilang ang lahat ng dakilang kapangyarihan—na bumubuo ng dalawang magkasalungat na alyansang militar: ang mga Kaalyado at ang Axis na kapangyarihan. Sa isang kabuuang digmaan na direktang kinasasangkutan ng higit sa 100 milyong tauhan mula sa higit sa 30 bansa, itinapon ng mga pangunahing kalahok ang kanilang buong kakayahan sa ekonomiya, industriya, at siyentipiko sa likod ng pagsisikap sa digmaan, na pinalabo ang pagkakaiba sa pagitan ng mga mapagkukunang sibilyan at militar. Malaki ang ginampanan ng sasakyang panghimpapawid sa labanan, na nagbigay-daan sa madiskarteng pambobomba sa mga sentro ng populasyon at ang dalawang tanging paggamit ng mga sandatang nuklear sa digmaan. Ang Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig ay ang pinakanakamamatay na labanan sa kasaysayan ng tao; nagresulta ito sa 70 hanggang 85 milyong pagkamatay, karamihan ay mga sibilyan. Sampu-sampung milyong tao ang namatay dahil sa mga genocide (kabilang ang Holocaust), gutom, masaker, at sakit. Matapos ang pagkatalo ng Axis, sinakop ang Alemanya at Japan, at nagsagawa ng mga tribunal ng krimen sa digmaan  laban sa mga pinunong Aleman at Hapon. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            3. Essay about world war 1 and 2, 250 words please​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>American forces and the Japanese Army during the World War I in the Philippines. It lasted for 29 days and it devastated the City of Manila that cost 100,000 innocent lives and millions of pesos of invaluable heritage structures. Hence, it is considered to be the most brutal conflagration in the history of the Philippines. Nonetheless, despite the bad memories it left to millions of Filipinos, this battle is an important battle in Philippine History because this paved way to the attainment of actual independence. After the victory of the Americans in the Battle of Manila, the Commonwealth was eventually revived back in control of the Philippines. The revival of the Commonwealth was essential in the fulfillment of the transitory provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Law – the concession law recognising Philippine Independence on 1946. Meaning to say, without the Battle of Manila, Philippines could have still been an exclave of the Japanese empire and Filipinos could have not able to establish their own de jure republic. Thus, the Battle of Manila was the key event that opened the opportunity for the Filipinos to finally actualize their dreams of independence and sovereignty from foreign control and even dependence.</p><p></p><p>However, despite its importance in our history, the Battle of Manila; the World War 2 and the rest of wars in Philippine history are taught in class apathetically — i.e., usually in knowing who were the leaders and whether who won and who lost in the battlefield. I claim because I experienced it myself. Textbook are even on that context. The leaders of war are the focus of the study but little empathy is given to every child’s broken future, to every woman who shattered their dignity, to every father who lost their moment to say even a farewell to their families. The people’s stories of pain, their stories of loss, their stories of eternal trauma are what more valuable than the leaders themselves, than the dates they fought, than the buildings they burnt. Indeed, I may know who Tomoyuki Yamashita, Sanji Iwabuchi and Douglas McArthur, but it is only today that I came to know the story of Julia Lopez who had her breasts sliced off and raped by the Japanese soldiers and had her hair set on fire; the story of the Manila Martyrs — Rev. Peter Fallon, Rev. John Heneghan, Rev. Patrick Kelly, and Rev. Joseph Monaghan, who were kidnapped and killed by the Japanese army; and of all the other terrible stories of loss and suffering during the infamous Manila Massacre and Rape. </p><p></p><p>Personally, it is important to me because this war is a reminder that I shall foster and cherish my freedom; protect the State’s security from invasion and from its downfall from corruption; and help in sustaining the Republic that our veterans of war have fought for before. Without the Battle of Manila and the eventual recapitulation of the city from the Japanese, I may be suffering the same way other Filipinos had experienced up until today. Moreover, as a future social science teacher, this battle is important to me because this urges me to teach and inspire my future students to love their country more than themselves, to protect and foster their independence and democracy but this time in a way that is diplomatic than through arms and ammunition. I also want to promote the ending of the culture of war and violence as an advocacy and rather promote diplomacy in any form of conflict. The Battle of Manila reminds us that in war, there is no winner, all become losers. And lastly I want to teach history to my future students with empathy and depth to the real victims of war.

DIGITAL BAYANIHAN AMID COVID-19Experts all over the world believe that to mitigate the effects and end the spread of the Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), all sectors of the society must work hand in hand to fight the deadly virus.It is not the sole responsibility of the government to stop the global pandemic, and it is imperative for people to join in the efforts and collectively stop the virus from further infecting anyone.This rings true in the Philippines, where the spirit of Bayanihan is slowly being revived amid the onslaught of natural and man-made catastrophes that struck the whole country during the first three months of 2020.Various non-government organizations and even individuals have started calling on Filipinos to help in the war against the pandemic, whether it’s through volunteerism or through monetary donations.Donations drives have been launched by various groups to help protect frontline healthcare workers from the virus. These came amid the reported scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPEs) in hospitals.Likewise, groups and individuals are seeking support to fund relief goods for the families that are in need of food and personal hygiene kits, as major cities and provinces and provinces impose in their own community quarantine protocols.There are hundreds of more donations drives that are hundreds of more donations that are happening across the Philippines today, signaling the strong revival of the Filipino culture of Bayanihan—only that with the strict implementation of community quarantines and social distancing protocols, donations are facilitated through mobile phones.Source: globalnation.inquirer.net (posted March 2019) Questions:1.

                            9. The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

There are many types of narrative text, including myths, fables, traditional tales, novels, short stories etc. 2. EXPLANATORY TEXT Purpose: It moves beyond providing straightforward descriptions to looking at things like causes and reasons. They move beyond a retelling of what happened such as in a simple report, to address the why and how of what happened. 3. EXPOSITORY TEXT Purpose: It exists to provide facts in a way that is educational and purposeful.The text is fact-based with the purpose of exposing the truth through a reliable source. It focuses on educating its reader. Its purpose is not primarily to amuse, but to enlighten and instruct. The objective is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. 4. Factual/Personal Recount Purpose: Recounts focus on retelling events and are generally intended to inform and/or entertain. 5. Persuasive Text Purpose: Its purpose is to convince the reader of the merits of adopting a particular viewpoint or taking a specific course of action ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Second World War was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945, and Great Britain played a significant role in this conflict. As one of the major Allied powers, Great Britain was heavily involved in the war effort, both on the military front and on the home front. In this essay, we will examine what happened in Great Britain during World War II.</p><p></p><p>At the outbreak of the war in 1939, Great Britain was a country that had not yet fully recovered from the devastation of World War I. However, the country was quick to mobilize its resources and prepare for the coming conflict. The government instituted a system of rationing and civilian defense measures, such as air raid shelters and blackout curtains, to protect its citizens from the German bombing campaign.</p><p></p><p>The Battle of Britain, which took place between July and October of 1940, was a key turning point in the war for Great Britain. The country's Royal Air Force (RAF) successfully defended against the German Luftwaffe in a series of air battles over the English Channel, preventing the Germans from gaining air superiority over the country. This victory was crucial in allowing Great Britain to maintain its position in the war and continue to fight against Nazi Germany.</p><p></p><p>On the home front, Great Britain faced numerous challenges during the war. The Blitz, a sustained bombing campaign by the Germans against British cities, caused widespread destruction and loss of life. However, the British people showed remarkable resilience and solidarity in the face of this adversity, with many volunteering for civil defense duties and supporting each other through the difficult times.</p><p></p><p>Great Britain's military contribution to the war effort was also significant. British troops fought in numerous theaters of the war, including North Africa, Italy, and Europe, playing a key role in the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany. The country's naval power was also instrumental in maintaining control of the seas and protecting vital supply routes.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Great Britain's involvement in World War II was a defining moment in the country's history. Despite the challenges and hardships faced by the British people, the country remained steadfast in its determination to defend itself and its allies against the threat of Nazi Germany. The war helped to shape modern British society and culture, and the country's role in the conflict is still remembered and celebrated today.</p><br />

I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?
