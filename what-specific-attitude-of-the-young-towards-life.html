This wisdom can be a valuable resource for younger people, who may not yet have the same level of experience and understanding. Personal experience may vary.<br />

                        <p><strong>Reflection on the poem When I Was One-and-Twenty by Alfred Edward Housman.</strong></p><p></p>The <strong>theme</strong> portrayed by the poem is love or more precisely the result of love.Based on the text, the attitude of young people towards life is shown that they tend to give or do everything without thinking much so that they later regret it.The special <strong>advice</strong> given by a wise man to youth is not to give everything to others. We could give a lot of things, but there are things we should not give because if we give them to the wrong person we will regret it.No, the young man does not listen to the advice of the wise man because he is still young and still naive so he only does what he wants.Based on the text, I can conclude that wise people perceive life as something that must be lived carefully and not rashly because otherwise, we will suffer losses from the wrong things we do.The meaning of the idea of<strong> 'wisdom of elder' </strong>in the given poem is that elders can become wiser because they may have made many mistakes and experienced many difficulties which made them then understand many things and become wise.One of my <strong>personal experiences</strong> related to the answers to the reflection questions from the poem above is that I also made the mistake of not listening to my parent's advice. They say that I should be careful in choosing my friends and not give my all, especially to new friends. I didn't believe it and it turned out that my new friend wasn't a nice person and I regretted it. Older people aren't always right, but they certainly have learned a lot and we should listen to them more in our youth.<p></p><p><strong>See more examples of poem reflection</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1940644</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
