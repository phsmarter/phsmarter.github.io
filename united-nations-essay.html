PH seeks 148 million doses from 7 COVID-19 vaccine makers (from Philippine Daily Inquirer/05:32 AM January 07, 2021)MANILA, Philippines - The Philippines is negotiating with seven vaccine manufacturers to procure at least 148 million doses as it seeks to inoculate close to two- thirds of its population this year, according to the head of the country's national vaccination program and chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID- 19.Speaking at the Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday, Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government was hoping to close deals with Novavax, Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson of the United States, United Kingdom's AstraZeneca, China's Sinovac Biotech and Russia's Gamaleya Institute."Based on our current negotiations, we will be able to purchase at least 148 million doses from more or less seven manufacturers. However, it will be dependent on theglobal supply," he said."The government will have a portfolio of vaccines," he said. "This means we will get vaccines from different manufactures. This is to ensure that we will have vaccines for everyone, particularly this year 2021."​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is the role of the most powerful states in the world, via the United Nations, by abiding to theories of liberalism which advocate for the use of international institutions to deliver peace, to intervene in the conflicts of other states if mass atrocities are being committed against vulnerable populations, or seem likely in the near future, and no other state or organization is stepping in to protect them. In order to most effectively provide this assistance, the Department for Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) of the UN needs to change its definition of peacekeeping from a largely pacifistic approach to one that sees the necessity in using force when confronted with crimes against humanity.</p><p>The basis for this assertion is the philosophy of humanism, which uses egalitarian principles, celebrating the beauty of life and the value of human beings as a whole group, placing importance on the well-being of all humans throughout the world. In essence, no life is more important than another, as we are all human beings, regardless of our place of origin. Nationalism and nation-states are just methods to further divide humanity. Thus, all citizens of the world should be afforded an equal entitlement to the protection of a powerful military force.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>An Essay on United Nations Organisation: The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization established on 24 October 1945, to promote international co-operation. During the Second World War, the need for an agency that could act as a successor to the League of Nations was felt and so, the United Nations Charter was drafted at a conference in April-June 1945. This charter came into effect on 24 October 1945, and the UN began its operations.</p><p></p><p>The general purpose of the United Nations was in homogeneity with that of the League of Nations. Its structure and functions too are in congruity with its predecessor. Same goes with its principal organs and related agencies. In some respects, however, the UN constituted a very different organization, especially with regard to its objective of maintaining international peace and security and its commitment to economic and social development.</p><p></p><p>The UN’s mission to preserve world peace was convoluted in its early decades by the presence of Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and Congo as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization’s membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its exenditure on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.</p><p></p><p>The general purpose of the United Nations was in homogeneity with that of the League of Nations.

It was created after the WW II at the time when the world was under the threat of another war. Economical situation was frightening as endless wars and conflicts exhausted the economical systems of the countries. Frightening words, such as fascism, wars, nuclear bombing and genocide were the part of terrible reality of those times (Childers, Urquhart). It’s quite natural that people, who wanted to stop this nightmare joined their forces and created the organization, which could create and support the balance in the world and would care about the interests of each separate country, each separate individual in a way, which would not break this fragile balance. We may be not satisfied with the situation in the modern world we face now but it’s necessary to remember about he bigger evil we escaped and I think we must be thankful to the UN for this.</p><p></p><p>#LearnWithBrainly</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p></p><p>[tex]\huge\red{\boxed{\tt{{C}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\green{\boxed{\tt{{A}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\blue{\boxed{\tt{{R}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\red{\boxed{\tt{{R}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\green{\boxed{\tt{{Y}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\blue{\boxed{\tt{{O}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\red{\boxed{\tt{{N}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\green{\boxed{\tt{{L}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\blue{\boxed{\tt{{E}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\red{\boxed{\tt{{A}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\green{\boxed{\tt{{R}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\blue{\boxed{\tt{{N}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\red{\boxed{\tt{{I}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\green{\boxed{\tt{{N}}}}[/tex][tex]\huge\blue{\boxed{\tt{{G}}}}[/tex]</p><p>(。・∀・)ノ</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I am Jasmin Navasquez. I'm from Carcar City, Cebu, Philippines. In our place in Visaya, we usually speaks Bisaya because it's our original language specifically in Carcar City. I lived in Carcar City in which I can be proud of. Carcar City is home to various historical buildings from Spanish and American colonial eras, earning its title "The Heritage City of Cebu". Carcaranons are humble, helpful, thankful and hospitable. The Carcar City is one of the most beautiful cities in Cebu. It has a beautiful places that you can travel, experience and capture the moments. These are: Carcar City Museum where you can see all the showcasing antique furniture, jars and other items that showcase the town's journey. Second is the St. Catherine of Alexandria Church is one of the oldest parishes in Cebu. This church was named after town's patron saint, St. Catherine of Alexandria, in whose honor the people of Carcar celebrate the yearly fiesta every 25th of November. Thirdly, a Jose Rizal's monument stands in the middle with the national heroes words inscribed in Cebuano. And many more.</p><p></p><p>In Carcar City, our native language is Bisaya but what's its unique? Well, when we say Bisaya words we are having a strong diction in speaking which seems angry but not it's normal. I am proud being a Bisaya because by these I can communicate with my co-bisaya which is really important to me. We need to preserve our native language because it is the one who we can identify as Bisaya. </p><p></p><p>Filipinos should respect the diversity in culture and language in order for us to make peace and can communicate with others because through these we can be called as one happy family. </p><p></p><p>#CarryonLearning</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I think it would be better if we should obey what are the new restrictions that they announced. It's afterall, for our own safety.</p><p></p><p>2. Even I, is not really that favorable about that said vaccine. But if we don't really have a choice, then so be it. Just make sure that it's safe enough not to kill humans. But well, if your time is now ticking, we won't able to stop that anymore, right? God's always here. Just trust him.</p><p></p><p>3. I know many people got fired or resign on their works and they can't do anything to have money but I think it's too much if we will use prohibited drugs to sell, it's inherently bad. If life gets hard, we should work harder. Life don't have shortcuts. You're just going to involve yourself in danger. </p><p></p><p>4. This is good. Minors are not allowed to go outside at night. There are a lot of danger waiting for you if you'll be stubborn. </p><p></p><p>5. It's a big help to teachers and students. Students who can't buy gadgets should be their priority. Not all of people can cope up with this kind of learning. Afterall, it's their responsibility to keep their nation at ease and safe.</p><p></p><p>Pa-brainliest ako. Thank you</p><br />
