                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</a>

Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student who has been doing distance learning for more than a year now, I have encountered several problems that affect my study habits. One of the common issues I encounter is the lack of motivation to study. Since there is no physical classroom and no face-to-face interaction with the teacher, it is easy to lose motivation and procrastinate. Another problem I face is the difficulty of asking questions and getting immediate feedback from the teacher. Sometimes, I have to wait for a long time before I get a response from the teacher.</p><p></p><p>The problems that I encounter in distance learning are caused by several factors. One of which is the lack of structure and routine. Without a set schedule, it is easy to fall into a trap of not studying at all or studying inconsistently. Another factor is the lack of social interaction. Learning is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about building relationships and interacting with other people. Without this aspect, it can be difficult to stay motivated.</p><p></p><p>To overcome these problems, I have developed several solutions that help me learn best despite not having a face-to-face class. Firstly, I have created a schedule that I follow every day. This schedule includes dedicated study time and breaks in between. Secondly, I make sure to ask questions whenever I have one. I email my teacher or classmates for clarification or set up a virtual meeting with them. Thirdly, I try to make online learning more interactive by participating in online discussions, group projects, and other activities.</p><p></p><p>My study habits include several techniques that help me understand the topics even without the presence of my teacher. These include taking detailed notes, watching online tutorials, and reviewing past lessons. I also make use of online resources such as e-books, online libraries, and research databases.</p><p></p><p>To prove to other students that my study habits are effective, I would show them my grades and the amount of knowledge I have acquired. I would also encourage them to try out my study techniques and see for themselves the results. Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of discipline and consistency in distance learning. By following a set schedule and staying motivated, anyone can succeed in online learning.</p><p></p><p><strong>Notes</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>Good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>luck</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pag</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sulat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>bro</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mahaba</strong><strong> </strong><strong>yan</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Advice</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lang</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i-pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>print</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>nalang.</strong></p><p></p><br />

Discuss the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating local culture into education.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The Constructivist Theory and traditional teaching approaches differ significantly in the context of teaching MTB-MLE. Traditional teaching methods emphasize the teacher as the primary source of knowledge and use a standardized curriculum, while Constructivist Theory emphasizes active learning and student-centered approaches. In MTB-MLE, Constructivist Theory supports the use of local languages as a medium of instruction, which enables students to connect their learning to their own culture and experiences. Traditional teaching methods, on the other hand, may not be as effective in supporting students' language development and cultural identity.</p><p></p><p>2.Implementing a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE can be challenging because it requires a significant shift in teaching practices and the creation of culturally relevant materials. However, it can also provide opportunities for students to engage in active learning and develop critical thinking skills. The potential benefits of adopting a Constructivist approach include improved language development, increased engagement and motivation, and better academic performance. However, there may be drawbacks, such as the need for more resources and training for teachers. The effectiveness of a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE may also depend on the specific context and community in which it is being taught.</p><p></p><p>3.Knowing the mother tongue is significant in education because it enables learners to connect their learning to their own culture and experiences. Using the mother tongue as a medium of instruction can also improve learners' language development and overall academic performance. Additionally, using the mother tongue can help preserve and promote local languages and cultures. However, the disadvantages of using the mother tongue include limited access to learning materials and limited opportunities for students to learn additional languages that may be necessary for future academic and professional endeavors.</p><p></p><p>4.Understanding the local culture is important in education because it allows teachers to create culturally relevant materials and practices that engage students and promote learning. Incorporating local culture into teaching practices can also promote cultural diversity and respect. Effective incorporation of local culture involves engaging with the community, identifying local resources and practices, and creating learning materials that reflect students' experiences and cultural backgrounds. The potential benefits of incorporating local culture into education include increased student engagement and motivation, improved academic performance, and the promotion of cultural diversity. However, challenges may include limited resources and the need for cultural sensitivity and understanding</p><br />

We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

                            19. What are the 3 claims in ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY ON CYBERBULLYING.
Thank you in adv
Here's the essay:
Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.
During the past decade, researchers paid increased attention to the phenomenon of cyberbullying, focusing specifically on its adverse effects on victims’ health and well-being. Findings from multiple studies have demonstrated that children subject to systematic online abuse have increased risks for experiencing depression and somatic symptoms, as well as feeling lonely and vulnerable (Nixon, 2014). These people may also have social and communication problems that persist into adulthood, and they do not feel safe at school even if no one abuses them face-to-face. Interestingly, research suggests that both victims and bullies suffer from cyberbullying, with latter being more subject to unexplained aggression and delinquent behaviors (Nixon, 2014). It means that efforts at eliminating cyberbullying and supporting children should be directed at both victims and perpetrators.
The problem of cyberbullying is extremely difficult to address. Unlike school bullying that occurs in real life and can be detected by teachers and peers, this aggressive behavior is more elusive and invisible (Minton, 2013). Students rarely report being abused on the Internet, mostly because they realize that their parents and teachers would not help them. The problem is that even when a student reports cyberbullying, it is practically impossible to identify its source and punish abusers. For now, schools lack comprehensive anti-bulling policies and cannot come up with actual strategies and tactics to tackle this growing problem. Parents also seem to lack understanding of how detrimental cyberbullying may be for their children’s health and do not know how to support them.
I strongly believe that effective solutions to cyberbullying need to be introduced. The most important thing that needs to be done is student education. Children need to understand how cyberbullying affects them and their peers and why this type of behavior is unacceptable. They also need to be encouraged to seek professional advice and support of psychologists when cyber bullying bothers them. Parents should also be educated to detect the slight changes in their children’s behavior and help them overcome their problems successfully. Both schools and parents need to make sure that children feel protected and cared for and not allow them to suffer silently. Only an integrated approach to cyberbullying involving teachers, parents, and students can bring positive, long-term effects.
Ultimately, the way schools and parents combat cyberbullying will determine students’ safety and emotional well-being. Cyberbullying is a negative social trend that affects the most vulnerable and weak children, leading to psychological and psychosomatic problems, depression, anxiety, etc. Because this phenomenon is difficult to detect and prevent, it is extremely important to involve all stakeholders including teachers, families, and students. I am convinced that a collaborative approach to dealing with cyberbullies can reduce aggressive behavior and make children feel more protected, both at home and at school.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>TOPIC : STUDY HABITS OF A JUNIOR STUDENT.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As a junior high school student, I have encountered some problems when it comes to distance learning. One of the main problems is distractions. When I'm studying, my phone keeps buzzing, and my siblings or parents keep talking to me. It's hard to concentrate, and I tend to get sidetracked easily. Another issue is the lack of motivation. Sometimes, I don't feel like studying, and I procrastinate until it's too late.</p><p></p><p>The problems that I have in distance learning are caused by the environment around me. Since I'm at home, there are a lot of things that distract me. My siblings are also studying from home, so it can get noisy and chaotic at times. It's also hard to maintain a routine since I don't have a strict schedule like in school.</p><p></p><p>To overcome these problems, I have come up with some solutions. First, I try to create a conducive environment for studying. I make sure that I'm in a quiet room, and I turn off my phone or put it on silent mode. I also try to study during hours when my siblings are not too busy with their online classes. Second, I try to motivate myself by setting goals and rewards. For example, if I finish studying for two hours straight, I reward myself with a snack or a short break.</p><p></p><p>My study habits involve a balance between studying and other activities. I make sure that I have enough time for my hobbies and interests, so I don't get burnt out. I also try to take breaks in between study sessions to rest my mind and recharge. When it comes to understanding topics, I read the materials thoroughly and take down notes. If there's something that I don't understand, I search for more information online or ask my teacher during our online class.</p><p></p><p>To prove that my study habits are effective, I would show my grades and how I was able to cope with the challenges of distance learning. I would also share my tips and tricks with my classmates and encourage them to try it out for themselves. Ultimately, the best way to prove that my study habits work is by consistently performing well in school and achieving my goals.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
