The strike, which was organized by women's rights groups, quickly gained traction on social media, with the hashtag #kvennafrí (women's day off) trending on Twitter.</p><p></p><p>The strike was a huge success, with an estimated 90% of women in Iceland participating in some form. The protest gained international attention, with media outlets around the world covering the story.</p><p></p><p>The power of social media and information in this event was instrumental in bringing attention to the issue of gender inequality in Iceland. The strike sparked a national conversation about the gender pay gap, and the government responded by introducing new legislation to address the issue.</p><p></p><p>In 2018, Iceland became the first country in the world to make it illegal to pay men more than women for the same job. This historic change was a direct result of the media attention and public pressure generated by the 2016 women's strike.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Media and Information literacy<p>"Media and Information Literacy encompasses the knowledge, attitudes, and set of abilities required to recognize when and what information is required, where and how to access it, how to critically assess and organize it once obtained, and how to use it ethically." Learning, critical thinking, and interpretative abilities are included in the notion, which extends beyond communication and information technologies to include learning, critical thinking, and interpretative skills across and beyond professional and educational borders.</p><p></p><p>Oral, print, and digital information resources are all included in media and information literacy. In an increasingly digitized, interdependent, and global world, media and information literacy is a core human right that fosters greater social inclusion. It has the ability to bridge the gap between those who have access to a lot of information and those who don't. Individuals with knowledge of the functions of the media and information systems, as well as the conditions under which these functions are performed" Media and Information Literacy empowers and endows individuals with knowledge of the functions of the media and information systems, as well as the conditions under which these functions are performed.</p>Risks of failing to harness media and information properly.<p>Gathering Fake News could be a result of failing to harness media and information correctly.</p><p>Fake news, in general, is a fictitious story that is published and marketed as if it were true. In the past, fake news was mainly propaganda spread by powerful people to instill a particular belief or support a particular perspective, even if it was wholly false. Social media has now created a climate in which anyone with a political objective may spread lies as if they were real. People can be hired to post fake news on behalf of others, or automated programs, known as bots, can publish fake news that is generated automatically. People's motivations for creating and disseminating fake news are as varied as their individual viewpoints.</p><p></p>Its Consequences<p>While some fake news may appear to be harmless or merely amusing, much of it is nasty and even dangerous. Fake news is intended to influence people's beliefs, attitudes, or perceptions in order to influence their actions. This means that if you fall into the trap of accepting fake news, someone else's goal is driving your thoughts and judgments. Furthermore, in some parts of the world, producing and disseminating fake news might have legal ramifications.</p><p></p><p>To know more about check this  </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3063592
