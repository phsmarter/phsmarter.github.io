                        "I do" by Eileen R. Tabios<p>a poem analysis (Part 2)</p><p></p><p><strong>Which does not mean I cannot differentiate between a reflection and a shadow, a threnody and a hiccup, the untrimmed bougainvillea bush mimicking a fire and the lawn lit by a burning cross.</strong></p><p>A point of view that you are that “women” that faces the same situation, the mindset would be that all English speakers are the same as a human being of course. But if we are going to base it on the other side of the spectrum, this would be a really good example of a fallacy. Take it for example in the past, where a lot of countries are being heavily influenced by the superpower countries that until now, describes the same thing. That is why most people now are proficient in English even it is not their first language because of the colonization from them. They think that countries wouldn’t ever thrive if it wasn’t for them. At some point it is true, where the English Language made a breakthrough and change in the different kinds of traditions and culture in other countries. There has been changes such in grammar and accent, they way we behave in public and the ethics that has formed throughout the years. And one of them is the “segregation” of the primary and the ”second language speakers” like our country. A reflection and a shadow have similarities but one of them “blocks” the light that it blocks and “deprives” human rights that is on the shadow, but a reflection would always continue to “bounce” and the cycle never ends unless the inevitable properties of “light” will ever change. It persuades us to change the “light” of the society, where people are discriminated because of their race. A threnody and a hiccup point out the proficiency a person can speak English which is still a synonymous thing and the last phrase point out the different beliefs such as religion, and people assume that a person who has that kind of religion speak that kind of language.</p><p></p><p><strong>Because I do know English, I have been variously called Miss Slanted Vagina, The Mail Order Bride, The One With The Shoe Fetish, The Squat Brunette Who Wears A Plaid Blazer Over A Polka-Dot Blouse, The Maid.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>When I hear someone declare war while observing a yacht race in San Diego, I understand how “currency” becomes “debased.”</strong></p><p>It shows that nationalities can mean a specific stereotype, they could mean a lot of jobs that heats up some controversies as “dirty work” such as prostítutes  and maids and even preferences that are common to one group is being conservative and a lot more traits. Those are really degrading and it shows that you don’t have the ability to do a lot of things. It also applies about how “currency” becomes “debased” where it is the same thought but it applies into a whole nation. The first paragraph stereotypes ethnicity while the second paragraph stereotypes countries.</p><p></p><p><strong>What’s the poem wanted to tell?</strong></p><p>A very prominent fact is until now there are a lot of cases of discrimination, not just on the people who “know English” but also who are challenged in different aspects. The readers would  evoke the thought that the people the same of her kind should be respected as anyone else and not being described as a “lower” human being. The stigma has to be abolished and being a citizen in your own country is never an excuse. We never have to gatekeep and keep other people very suspicious just because of the different stereotypes. Everyone is a human and everyone shall deserve to be given equality on human rights.</p><p><strong>Hope it helps.

                        <p>After reading the poem "On the Stairs" by Eleanor Tabios, it can be interpreted as an exploration of the moments in life that are not often given much attention or thought.

Tabios suggests that these small but significant moments are worth remembering and cherishing.</p><p></p><p>In terms of form, the poem is written in free verse, with short lines that create a sense of rhythm. The lack of punctuation and capitalization creates a sense of conversational tone, making the reader feel as if they are standing on the stairs alongside the speaker.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "On the Stairs" is a contemplative and thought-provoking poem that reminds us to take notice of the small moments in life that are often overlooked. Tabios' use of imagery and form effectively conveys the ideas of memory and appreciation of the present moment.</p><br />

                            10. write a critical analysis using biographical and new criticism approach of the poem anabelle lee edgar allan poe​</h2><br />
                        <p>After ‘The Raven’, which is undoubtedly Poe’s most popular poem, ‘Annabel Lee’ is perhaps his next best-known and admired. ‘Annabel Lee’ has been called ‘the simplest and sweetest of [Edgar Allan Poe’s] ballads’ (by Poe’s biographer, George Edward Woodberry), but how ‘simple’ the poem is remains to be seen. Is it a ballad, or narrative poem, or is it a lyric? Before we grapple with some of these questions and offer some words of analysis, here’s a reminder of the text of the poem ‘Annabel Lee’.
</p><p>Annabel Lee
</p><p>It was many and many a year ago,
</p><p>In a kingdom by the sea,
</p><p>That a maiden there lived whom you may know
</p><p>By the name of Annabel Lee;
</p><p>And this maiden she lived with no other thought
</p><p>Than to love and be loved by me.
</p><p>
</p><p>I was a child and she was a child,
</p><p>In this kingdom by the sea,
</p><p>But we loved with a love that was more than love—
</p><p>I and my Annabel Lee—
</p><p>With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
</p><p>Coveted her and me.
</p><p>
</p><p>And this was the reason that, long ago,
</p><p>In this kingdom by the sea,
</p><p>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
</p><p>My beautiful Annabel Lee;
</p><p>So that her highborn kinsmen came
</p><p>And bore her away from me,
</p><p>To shut her up in a sepulchre
</p><p>In this kingdom by the sea.
</p><p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
</p><p>Went envying her and me—
</p><p>Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
</p><p>In this kingdom by the sea)
</p><p>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
</p><p>Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
</p><p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love
</p><p>Of those who were older than we—
</p><p>Of many far wiser than we—
</p><p>And neither the angels in Heaven above
</p><p>Nor the demons down under the sea
</p><p>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
</p><p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  </p><p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
</p><p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
</p><p>And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
</p><p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
</p><p>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
</p><p>Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
</p><p>In her sepulchre there by the sea—
</p><p>In her tomb by the sounding sea.
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>In summary, the narrator of the poem tells of his love for Annabel Lee, who lived in a kingdom by the sea. The two of them were childhood sweethearts, but Annabel Lee caught a chill one day and died. The narrator believes that the angels in heaven took Annabel Lee from him because they were jealous of the love he and Annabel Lee shared. Her relatives buried her in a sepulchre, which the narrator of the poem continues to visit, so that he can be ‘together’ with his dead beloved, Annabel Lee.
</p><p>
</p><p>‘Annabel Lee’ was the last poem Edgar Allan Poe completed before his untimely death in 1849. Precisely who the inspiration for the character of ‘Annabel Lee’ was remains a mystery, although Poe’s cousin, Virginia, whom he fell in love with when she was thirteen, is the leading candidate. The narrator fell in love with Annabel Lee when they were both young and his love for her continues even after her death; however, the urge to offer a narrowly biographical analysis of ‘Annabel Lee’ should probably be resisted. Poe was an extraordinarily imaginative writer (almost single-handedly perfecting the short-story form, and inventing detective fiction along the way); not everything he wrote stemmed from his own personal circumstances.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Poe’s poems are predominantly cast in the Romantic mode, meaning that he follows poets like John Keats in setting many of his narrative poems in enchanted or fairy-tale lands. ‘Annabel Lee’ is a prime example: the fact that Annabel Lee lives in ‘a kingdom by the sea’, and that the events the narrator outlines happened ‘many and many a year ago’ (the poet’s version of ‘once upon a time’). He is looking back, nostalgically, at the young love he and Annabel Lee shared; but putting such distance between ‘now’ and ‘then’ also reinforces the strength of his love for her, since he continues to visit her grave years after her death.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although ‘Annabel Lee’ is often described as a ballad, this is only half-true. The poem has the ring of a ballad that has been passed down through oral tradition (and that was designed to be sung and danced to, accompanied by music), but it doesn’t follow the strict ballad metre (quatrains of alternating iambic tetrameter and trimeter, rhymed abcb). Instead, the form of ‘Annabel Lee’ is actually a little more irregular: the poem begins with a stanza of alternating tetrameter and trimeter, true, but there are six lines rather than four, and the metre is more jaunty and lively than regular iambic metre: many of the feet are anapests (i.e. two unstressed syllables followed by a stressed) as opposed to iambs (i.e. one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed). This keeps the metre of the poem on its toes (we might say it keeps the poem’s ‘feet’ on its toes), and reflects the sudden death of Annabel Lee as well as the ballad-like feel Poe is seeking to create, harking back to medieval ballads about true love and kingdoms by the sea.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>"I do" by Eileen R. Tabios</strong></p><p><strong>a poem analysis (Part 1)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>When we first observe the way that the poem portrays, it indicates that there is someone speaking, in which it is a woman who has the ability to speak English. However, it indicates that whenever you speak English, it doesn’t mean that you are as the “level” as someone else. The English Language is considered as the universal spoken language in the world. That means, a lot of educational institutions reinforce the English Language as part of the curriculum. While a lot of people can speak English, there is still a difference of having the same language as the mother tongue and the learned language and it is really based on your ethnicity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I do know English and, therefore, when hungry, can ask for more than minimum wage, pointing repeatedly at my mouth and yours.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I think this line meant of all of the people who can speak English and at the same time, do work for other nations because they aren’t really contented and they can’t sustain their families in their own country. One good example is Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW’s) who decided to take a risk to make their families better. While this may be noble job but seeing this last phrase has a really suggestive meaning. It expresses the act of kissing one another.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I shall call you “Master” with a lack of irony; lift my cotton blouse; cup my breasts to offer them to your eyes, your lips, your tongue; keen at the moon hiding at 11 a.m. to surface left tendon on my neck. For your teeth. And so on.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>No need to decipher your response—and if you wish, go ahead: spank me.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I can remind you of the rose petals I mailed to you after releasing them from the padded cell between my thighs.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>These lines express an act of a woman of having a sexual intercourse in a literal context, but when we are going to describe it into a more different thought about the ones who can speak English, it could mean that other people who can speak English as they are being demoralized and deprived like being deflowered (in a way that removing a person’s purity rises us on a stereotype on the society that he or she is an outcast). It is not just woman who is involved on such prejudice and discrimination but below is this line that finally opens up what that woman really points out into the poem.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Part 2 of my analysis is on the Brainly Link below:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>brainly.ph/question/12953424</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Texts that interpret literary works are usually persuasive texts. Literary critics may conduct a close reading of a literary work, critique a literary work from the stance of a particular literary theory, or debate the soundness of other critics’ interpretations. The work of literary critics is similar to the work of authors writing evaluative texts. For example, the skills required to critique films, interpret laws, or evaluate artistic trends are similar to those skills required by literary critics.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:“Literary texts” include works of fiction and poetry. In school, English instructors ask students to critique literary texts, or works. Literary criticism refers to a genre of writing whereby an author critiques a literary text, either a work of fiction, a play, or poetry. Alternatively, some works of literary criticism address how a particular theory of interpretation informs a reading of a work or refutes some other critics’ reading of a work.</strong></p><p></p><br />
