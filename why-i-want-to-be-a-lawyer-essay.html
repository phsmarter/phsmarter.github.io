                            2. Why do you want to be a lawyer?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>to help people is not do it</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>follow ticktok Manny's tikstok</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What's the best answer for "Why do you want to be a lawyer?"</p><p></p><p>Because:</p><p></p>You promote a knowledge of being able to communicate and negotiate. In the law, you don't shy away from conflict. You confront it. As James Baldwin said, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”<p></p>Becoming a lawyer means learning how to to negotiate and learning how to manage people. The Carnegie Institute (one of them ) says that 87% of financial success is three things: (1) personality, (2) ability to negotiate, (3) ability to manage people. So, only 13% relates to technical skills. Personality is obviously a problem for a lot of lawyers. But becoming a lawyer means learning about negotiation and people management, two of the really important determinants of financial success.<p></p>Law is one of the few professions that intensely analyzes the written decisions of the past as guides for current decisions.<p></p>Law is one of the few professions that encourages and promotes argument as a way to find truth.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Here's more or less what I said to an interviewer at UC Berkeley's law school: ----I think studying law is the best way to understand what our society is about, how it runs, what its rules are, how politics are involved, and how the individual person is affected by all that. And you can make a living as a lawyer---. You may scoff, but this happened to be what I honestly believed at the time, a belief arising from talking with several experienced lawyers, public and private. Fifty years on, it turns out they, and I, were right. That is, what I took from the law, aside from "making a living," was an understanding of how things work, or don't, here. </p><p></p><p>I hope I can help you</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: they want to experience success, financial and otherwise, and these careers have traditionally been seen as stable, worthy, respected, and financially sound.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> Higher salary, or ambition</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Why do people choose high-paying jobs?</strong></p><p>If you are well educated and skilled, the easiest way to fulfill your dream is to get high-paying jobs. A high-paid job satisfies one's basic needs and at the same time provides the key to spending the surplus in fulfilling one's dreams like buying homes, cars, and other luxury lifestyles. Irrespective of education and family background, it’s common human nature to dream about more and more money. If you are well educated and skilled, the easiest way to fulfill your dream is to get high-paying jobs.</p><p></p><p>It’s true that money counts, but while choosing a career one should be very cautious in deciding the salary advantages and disadvantages of high-paying jobs in the long run.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ambition</strong></p> Is a strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard work.<p><strong>What is ambition in life?</strong></p>Ambition is when you have the desire and determination to achieve great things. Ambitious people use hard work and focus to find success in their work and personal lives. They have an inner drive that helps them stay motivated when working toward their goals.<p><strong>Why is ambition so important?</strong></p>Ambition drives them to advance and accomplish their goals. Well-aimed and supported by values, ambition reflects a healthy self-esteem and higher power of abstraction and visualization of the future.<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the field of legal ethics, there’s an amorality theory that states that lawyers are not responsible for what they do as long as they are representing their clients within the law. as an attorney, your legal obligation is to keep the secrets of your client and not to go to the police, as that would make you a very bad lawyer indeed. A criminal lawyer can defend someone they know is guilty as long as they do not lie or knowingly mislead the court. Attorneys have a legal obligation to protect their clients and to ensure they have the maximum guarantees during the legal process. So lawyers are not incurring in immoral behaviour? They are not, because it's not the attorney as a person who is helping this presumed child molester.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Basically, I want to become a lawyer because I believe that it is a good way of rendering service to society and that it will fully develop in me skills, abilities, and attitudes that I can apply in a lot of aspects of my life. I believe that the law profession plays an integral role in any community as it is generally works to analyze and solve legal theories and ensure that justice is enforced. In this regard, I want to be involved in that kind of profession while at the same time ensuring my professional growth.<p></p>For me, the interesting characteristics that a lawyer possesses are his or her wit, boldness, and audacity. In general, a lawyer exudes confidence and integrity while doing his or her job because this creates an aura of authority and professionalism around him. A lawyer must also be in total control of his or her emotions at all times especially during intense moments in court. In addition, it is notable that he or she works well under pressure, which is something I would like to emulate and apply in various situations in my life. In this regard, I want to have the same kind of confidence and calmness and possess unparalleled analytical and critical skills because this would no doubt aid me in several aspects of my life. I also believe that at present, I possess all of these traits and this is why I am convinced that the law profession is for me.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Cost of Law School</p><p>The average student loan debt for lawyers was $142,900 as of the 2015-2016 school year, the most recent year statistics are available.1﻿ Private law schools cost an average of $49,548 per academic year. Public schools cost significantly less, with an average cost of $21,300 per year.</p><p></p><p>Law School Timeline</p><p>Law school is a three-year program if you attend full time.4﻿ You can only qualify for law school after you've received your bachelor’s degree, which typically takes at least four years if you're attending school full time.5﻿ But you do have additional options.</p><p></p><p>Public Speaking</p><p>As an attorney, public speaking is a part of your day-to-day life. You'll present information to clients, juries, judges, arbitrators, opposing counsel, witnesses, boards, and colleagues.</p><p></p><p>Frequent Testing</p><p>You'll need to score well on several tests on your way to becoming a lawyer. Many law programs require you to take the LSAT to be admitted. The LSAT has a multiple-choice portion and a written portion.</p><p></p><p>Constant Writing</p><p>Words are a lawyer’s tool of the trade. Attorneys are expected to be good writers as well as excellent speakers. Trial attorneys will need to master oral and written persuasion as they argue motions, try cases, take depositions, and draft various legal pleadings. </p><p></p><p>Logical Reasoning and Analysis</p><p>Logical reasoning and critical-thinking skills are essential to the practice of law. Analytical skills are necessary for all practice areas, whether you're structuring a multi-million-dollar deal or developing a trial strategy. </p><p></p><p>Long Work Hours</p><p>This isn't a requirement for all lawyers, but some value-conscious clients might expect you to be accessible around the clock. Most lawyers work full time, and many work more than 40 hours per week.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Client Development</p><p>Most law firm attorneys are responsible for client development. Compensation, bonuses, draws, and partnership opportunities are frequently based on an attorney’s ability to bring in business for the firm, at least in part.</p><p></p><p>Professional Dress</p><p>Most lawyers spend their workdays in suits and business attire. Casual dress is not the norm.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hi! I hope this helps. Keep safe and godbless</p><br />
