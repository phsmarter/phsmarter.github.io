Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                                            Why it is important to know and understand by the waiter or server the establishment guidelines in operating ordering system?​essay: Every establishment has a specific protocol for taking orders from the table and giving them to the kitchen and assembly areas. A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. Asking for your order to be a "rush" order is not a good idea, unless there is a really good reason for it. Servers who are always "rush" orders will find themselves placed at the back of the queue, more often than not.Orders can be written on checks, the duplicate of which is given to the kitchen. If handwriting orders, your handwriting must be legible and easy to understand. Always use the appropriate abbreviations; do not make up your own -- the kitchen will not understand them. Keep your original check or ticket as this is your record of the food that you have ordered from the kitchen, and from which the final bill will be prepared. Never throw these away. If a mistake has been made, run a line through the mistake, and, if necessary, have the manager initial it.More and more restaurants are using a Point of Service computer where you will enter the order from your table and it is automatically delivered via the computer to the kitchen.Your biggest job will be the timing of your orders. Make a point of learning how long it takes to prepare any given dish, then put in the order for the one that takes the longest to prepare first. That way, all dinners for a given table should come out at the same time. Nothing is more uncomfortable for your guests than to serve three guests at a table, only to find out that the fourth guest's meal has not yet been started.The next point that requires your attention is to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Not only is this necessary for food safety, it also helps to preserve the beauty of the prepared food.There is nothing more unappetizing than to have a cold pat of butter melting on the bread and butter plate because it was served hot. It is your job to ensure that the food arrives at the table in the condition in which it was served from the kitchen.yan po sagot ko </a>

                            9. Second Quarter Project Directions: Read the model argumentative essay, identify the parts by rewriting the important or the essential statements in the box. Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We have shifted from the physical world to the cyber world, comprising of computers, and several other devices which can communicate over the internet. In this article, we’ll be focusing on the Operating System, which is best in the overall performance.
</p><p>
</p><p>Out of the <strong>different Operating Systems available</strong>, I prefer Windows OS because of the following reasons.
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Easy Installation
</p><p>One of the advantage which Windows OS has over other OS is its easy installation. For example Windows 10, in spite of being the latest OS from Microsoft, features a “lite” system requirements, requiring only 1GHz CPU and 1GB RAM. Another plus point is the in-built Microsoft Creation Tool, which allows helps in easy updating of the current machine or opts for a clean installation to a new device using a pen drive.
</p><p></p><p>Great Compatibility
</p><p>When it comes to compatibility, Windows triumphs over all other OS. It supports almost all the software available in the market.  </p><p></p><p>Support from the drivers
</p><p>Another plus point for Windows OS is the support of the drivers. When you install Windows OS, the drivers are installed along with it, and you don’t have to waste your time searching for the drivers separately.
</p><p></p><p>High Flexibility
</p><p>Windows OS is highly flexible in nature. You can customize in a various number of ways like by changing the outlook of the taskbar, change the theme from light to dark, customizing the start menu, etc., without the involvement of any third-party add-ons.  </p><p></p><p>Ambrosia for the gamers</p><p>Windows OS is perhaps the best OS for your games. You can play almost any game at full graphics in your Windows 10 OS, provided that you have pretty good hardware support. Windows 10 supports Direct X 12, which takes the gaming experience to the next level. So for gamers, no doubt Windows OS is like a match made in heaven.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I don't know if this is 150 words</strong></p><p><strong>Hope this is ok ^^</strong></p><br />

                            15. ESSAY: If you are going to create a new Operating System what is the name and what are the new features that other OS does not have?​</h2><br />
                        <p> I do not have personal preferences or opinions. However, I can provide you with some ideas on what features a new operating system could have.</p><p></p><p>If I were to create a new operating system, I would name it "NexusOS" and it would have several unique features that set it apart from other operating systems.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, NexusOS would be designed with a focus on user privacy and security. It would have built-in encryption features for data protection and user authentication, making it more secure than other operating systems. Users would have full control over their data and would be able to decide which apps and services have access to their personal information.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, NexusOS would have a highly customizable interface that allows users to personalize their desktop and workflow. It would offer a range of customization options, such as different themes, fonts, and icons, to make it easier for users to work the way they want to.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, NexusOS would have a built-in AI assistant that would help users with routine tasks such as scheduling appointments, sending emails, and managing files. It would be able to learn from the user's behavior and provide suggestions for improving productivity.</p><p></p><p>Fourthly, NexusOS would have a unified app store that integrates all the apps from different operating systems, making it easy for users to find and install their favorite apps without having to switch between different app stores.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, NexusOS would have a modular architecture that allows users to add or remove features as per their requirements. This would make the operating system more lightweight and efficient, leading to faster boot times and better performance.</p><p></p><p>Overall, NexusOS would be a modern and innovative operating system that prioritizes user privacy and security while offering a highly customizable and intelligent interface. It would be a game-changer in the world of operating systems and would set a new standard for innovation and user experience.</p><br />

                            17. Why it is important to know and understand by the waiter or server the establishment guidelines in operating ordering system?​essay: Every establishment has a specific protocol for taking orders from the table and giving them to the kitchen and assembly areas. A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. Asking for your order to be a "rush" order is not a good idea, unless there is a really good reason for it. Servers who are always "rush" orders will find themselves placed at the back of the queue, more often than not.Orders can be written on checks, the duplicate of which is given to the kitchen. If handwriting orders, your handwriting must be legible and easy to understand. Always use the appropriate abbreviations; do not make up your own -- the kitchen will not understand them. Keep your original check or ticket as this is your record of the food that you have ordered from the kitchen, and from which the final bill will be prepared. Never throw these away. If a mistake has been made, run a line through the mistake, and, if necessary, have the manager initial it.More and more restaurants are using a Point of Service computer where you will enter the order from your table and it is automatically delivered via the computer to the kitchen.Your biggest job will be the timing of your orders. Make a point of learning how long it takes to prepare any given dish, then put in the order for the one that takes the longest to prepare first. That way, all dinners for a given table should come out at the same time. Nothing is more uncomfortable for your guests than to serve three guests at a table, only to find out that the fourth guest's meal has not yet been started.The next point that requires your attention is to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Not only is this necessary for food safety, it also helps to preserve the beauty of the prepared food.There is nothing more unappetizing than to have a cold pat of butter melting on the bread and butter plate because it was served hot. It is your job to ensure that the food arrives at the table in the condition in which it was served from the kitchen.yan po sagot ko </h2><br />
