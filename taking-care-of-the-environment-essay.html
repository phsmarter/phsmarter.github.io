All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</a>

Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases and cancer, among other problems and diseases.</p><p></p><p>If we take care of nature, then nature will also take care of us in return. When we pollute the water sources, we are the ones who will lack clean water. If we cut down all trees for our short-term goals, we will suffer global warming, lack of rainfall to grow our food, and many other adverse situations.</p><br />

                            3. Write a 5 paragraph essay that is about the importance of taking care of the environment.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>please</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The environment is the foundation of all life on earth, and its health and well-being are crucial for the survival of all living things. Unfortunately, human activities have caused significant harm to the environment, leading to various environmental problems such as climate change, air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Therefore, it is essential to take care of the environment to ensure the survival of the planet and all its inhabitants.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant reasons why we should take care of the environment is to ensure the sustainability of natural resources. Natural resources such as water, air, and land are essential for human survival and economic development. However, overexploitation and pollution of these resources have led to their depletion and degradation, which threatens our ability to meet our basic needs and sustain economic growth.</p><p></p><p>Taking care of the environment also helps to mitigate climate change. Climate change is one of the most significant environmental challenges facing the world today, and its impacts are already being felt in various parts of the world. By reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainable practices such as renewable energy, we can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down the rate of climate change.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why taking care of the environment is essential is to protect biodiversity. Biodiversity is the variety of life on earth, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. It is crucial for maintaining ecosystem services such as pollination, water filtration, and soil fertility. However, human activities such as deforestation, overfishing, and pollution have led to the loss of biodiversity, which threatens the stability and resilience of ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>Finally, taking care of the environment is essential for the well-being of future generations. We have a responsibility to leave the planet in a better state than we found it, and this requires us to take care of the environment. By promoting sustainable practices and reducing our impact on the environment, we can ensure that future generations have access to clean air and water, healthy ecosystems, and a livable planet.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, taking care of the environment is essential for the survival of the planet and all its inhabitants. It is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of natural resources, mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and ensuring the well-being of future generations. Therefore, we must all take responsibility for our actions and promote sustainable practices that help to protect the environment.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, as humans, we often overlook the importance of taking care of our environment. We tend to prioritize our own wants and needs over the needs of our planet. However, it is crucial that we start to recognize the dire situation we are in and make changes to protect the environment. Our poster in Science class highlights the issues we are facing and it is a call to action that we cannot ignore.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, we need to take care of the environment because it is our home. We rely on the resources provided by the environment such as air, water, and food. If we do not take care of it, we risk losing these resources, which could lead to dire consequences. Pollution and climate change, for example, can affect the quality of air and water, making it difficult for us to survive.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, taking care of the environment is not just for our own benefit. We also need to consider future generations. If we do not make an effort to protect the environment, we leave behind a world that is no longer suitable for them to live in. We need to preserve the environment so that our children and their children can live in a healthy and sustainable world.</p><p></p><p>One of the steps we can take to care for our environment is to reduce our carbon footprint. This means that we need to be mindful of the amount of carbon dioxide we produce. We can do this by reducing our energy consumption, using renewable sources of energy, and using public transportation or carpooling instead of driving alone.</p><p></p><p>Another way to help the environment is to reduce waste. This means that we need to practice the 3 R's - Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. We can reduce waste by using products with less packaging, reusing items instead of throwing them away, and recycling materials that can still be used.</p><p></p><p>If we do not take care of the environment, we risk experiencing severe consequences. For example, climate change can cause extreme weather conditions such as floods and droughts. This can lead to crop failures and food shortages, affecting our ability to feed ourselves. Pollution can also harm our health, causing respiratory problems and other illnesses.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, we need to take care of our environment to ensure our survival as a species. It is not just for our own benefit but for the benefit of future generations. We can start by reducing our carbon footprint, reducing waste, and being mindful of the impact our actions have on the environment. The poster in Science class serves as a reminder that we need to take action now to protect the environment before it's too late. We cannot afford to wait any longer.</p><br />

Create kayo ng outline (either topic outline or sentence outline) based sa essay na ito. :)BirdsBy Pragati GhoshBirds are special kind of animal species with certain specific characteristics that are common to all of them. All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First of all, planting trees should be given massive attention. Above all, a tree is the source of oxygen. Unfortunately, due to construction, many trees have been cut down. This certainly reduces the amount of oxygen in the environment. Growing more trees means more oxygen. Hence, growing more trees would mean better life quality.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, people must give attention to forest conservation. Forests are vital for the Environment. However, deforestation certainly reduces the area of forests around the World. The government must launch programs to conserve the forests. The government must make harming forests a criminal offense.</p><p></p><p>Soil conservation is yet another important way to save the Environment. For this, there must be control of landslides, floods, and soil erosion. Furthermore, there should also be afforestation and tree plantation to conserve the soil. Also, terrace farming and using natural fertilizers are some more ways.</p><p></p><p>Waste management is a powerful way of protecting the environment. There must be proper disposal of wastes. Most noteworthy, this would help to keep the surroundings healthy. The government must ensure to clean the streets and other polluted land areas. Furthermore, there should be toilets in every house. Also, the government must provide enough public toilets.</p><p></p><p>Pollution is probably the biggest danger to the Environment. Smoke, dust, and harmful gases cause air pollution. These causes of air pollution come from industries and vehicles mostly. Furthermore, Chemicals and pesticides cause land and water pollution.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>madami Po</p><p>Hope it help</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>By contributing a small thing to do like recycling and.picking up trashes on the ground.</p><p>Soil conservation is yet another important way to save the Environment.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Use Reusable Bags</p><p></p><p>Plastic grocery-type bags that get thrown out end up in landfills or in other parts of the environment. These can suffocate animals who get stuck in them or may mistake them for food. Also, it takes a while for the bags to decompose.</p><p></p><p>2. Print as Little as Necessary</p><p></p><p>We have all had that teacher that wanted us to have a copy of every single reading when we come to class, or that professor who wanted a hard copy of the ten-page paper that is due next week.</p><p></p><p>3. Recycle</p><p></p><p>Recycling is such a simple thing to do, but so many people don’t do it. Many garbage disposal companies offer recycling services, so check with the company you use to see if they can help you get started! It is as simple as getting a bin and putting it out with your trash cans for free!</p><p></p><p>4. Use a Reusable Beverage Containers</p><p></p><p>Instead of buying individually-packaged drinks, consider buying a bulk container of the beverage you want and buying a reusable water bottle. Not only will this help the environment, but it will also help you save money since you are buying a bulk container.</p><p></p><p>5. Don’t Throw Your Notes Away</p><p></p><p>At the end of the semester, students are often stuck with notes they don’t need anymore, especially from GenEd classes that had little, if anything, to do with their major.</p><p></p><p>6. Save Electricity!</p><p></p><p>Use energy-efficient light bulbs instead of regular bulbs. They last longer, which will save you a bit of money (every little bit helps on a college budget, right?)</p><p></p><p>7. Save Water</p><p></p><p>Water is wasted more frequently than we can see. Turn off the faucet as you are brushing your teeth. Don’t turn your shower on until you’re ready to get in and wash your hair. Limit your water usage as you wash dishes. </p><p></p><p>8. Avoid Taking Cars or Carpool When Possible</p><p></p><p>Cars are harmful to the environment. Taking public transportation, walking, or riding a bike to class are better options that help the environment and your budget, as well as getting some exercise in!</p><p></p><br />
