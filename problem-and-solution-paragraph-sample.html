Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

One of the effects of social media is that it has led to an increase in cyberbullying. With the anonymity that social media provides, people can say hurtful things without the fear of repercussions. As a result, cyberbullying has become a significant problem, particularly among young people. It can lead to emotional distress, depression, and even suicide.</p><p></p><p>Second paragraph with Problem-Solution Signals:</p><p>Crime rates in urban areas have been steadily increasing over the past few years. This situation has prompted law enforcement agencies to look for solutions to reduce crime rates. One possible solution that has been proposed is the implementation of community policing programs. By partnering with the community, police officers can gain valuable insights into the local area and develop more effective crime-fighting strategies. This could involve organizing neighborhood watches, attending local events to build relationships, and collaborating with community leaders. If implemented correctly, community policing programs could be an effective way to reduce crime rates and improve public safety.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it's help arlottt balott</p><br />

The main cause of obesity is a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits. People who consume high-calorie food and do not engage in physical activity tend to gain weight, which can lead to obesity over time. This, in turn, leads to various health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and joint pain. Therefore, it is important to adopt healthy habits such as regular exercise and a balanced diet to prevent obesity and its associated health risks.</p><p></p><p>In this paragraph, the cause of obesity is a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits, and the effect is various health problems.

One of the main reasons for this is the increasing number of cars on the road. To solve this problem, governments can take several measures. One solution is to improve public transportation systems, such as buses and trains, to encourage people to use them instead of driving their cars. Another solution is to introduce carpooling programs, which can reduce the number of cars on the road during rush hour. Additionally, cities can invest in bike-sharing programs and create bike lanes to promote alternative modes of transportation. By implementing these solutions, cities can reduce traffic congestion and improve the quality of life for their residents.</p><p></p><p>In this paragraph, the problem is traffic congestion, and the solutions are improving public transportation, introducing carpooling programs, and promoting alternative modes of transportation.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>TOPIC : STUDY HABITS OF A JUNIOR STUDENT.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As a junior high school student, I have encountered some problems when it comes to distance learning. One of the main problems is distractions. When I'm studying, my phone keeps buzzing, and my siblings or parents keep talking to me. It's hard to concentrate, and I tend to get sidetracked easily. Another issue is the lack of motivation. Sometimes, I don't feel like studying, and I procrastinate until it's too late.</p><p></p><p>The problems that I have in distance learning are caused by the environment around me. Since I'm at home, there are a lot of things that distract me. My siblings are also studying from home, so it can get noisy and chaotic at times. It's also hard to maintain a routine since I don't have a strict schedule like in school.</p><p></p><p>To overcome these problems, I have come up with some solutions. First, I try to create a conducive environment for studying. I make sure that I'm in a quiet room, and I turn off my phone or put it on silent mode. I also try to study during hours when my siblings are not too busy with their online classes. Second, I try to motivate myself by setting goals and rewards. For example, if I finish studying for two hours straight, I reward myself with a snack or a short break.</p><p></p><p>My study habits involve a balance between studying and other activities. I make sure that I have enough time for my hobbies and interests, so I don't get burnt out. I also try to take breaks in between study sessions to rest my mind and recharge. When it comes to understanding topics, I read the materials thoroughly and take down notes. If there's something that I don't understand, I search for more information online or ask my teacher during our online class.</p><p></p><p>To prove that my study habits are effective, I would show my grades and how I was able to cope with the challenges of distance learning. I would also share my tips and tricks with my classmates and encourage them to try it out for themselves.

Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student who has been doing distance learning for more than a year now, I have encountered several problems that affect my study habits. One of the common issues I encounter is the lack of motivation to study. Since there is no physical classroom and no face-to-face interaction with the teacher, it is easy to lose motivation and procrastinate. Another problem I face is the difficulty of asking questions and getting immediate feedback from the teacher. Sometimes, I have to wait for a long time before I get a response from the teacher.</p><p></p><p>The problems that I encounter in distance learning are caused by several factors. One of which is the lack of structure and routine. Without a set schedule, it is easy to fall into a trap of not studying at all or studying inconsistently. Another factor is the lack of social interaction. Learning is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about building relationships and interacting with other people. Without this aspect, it can be difficult to stay motivated.</p><p></p><p>To overcome these problems, I have developed several solutions that help me learn best despite not having a face-to-face class. Firstly, I have created a schedule that I follow every day. This schedule includes dedicated study time and breaks in between. Secondly, I make sure to ask questions whenever I have one. I email my teacher or classmates for clarification or set up a virtual meeting with them. Thirdly, I try to make online learning more interactive by participating in online discussions, group projects, and other activities.</p><p></p><p>My study habits include several techniques that help me understand the topics even without the presence of my teacher. These include taking detailed notes, watching online tutorials, and reviewing past lessons. I also make use of online resources such as e-books, online libraries, and research databases.</p><p></p><p>To prove to other students that my study habits are effective, I would show them my grades and the amount of knowledge I have acquired. I would also encourage them to try out my study techniques and see for themselves the results. Additionally, I would emphasize the importance of discipline and consistency in distance learning. By following a set schedule and staying motivated, anyone can succeed in online learning.</p><p></p><p><strong>Notes</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>Good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>luck</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pag</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sulat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>bro</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mahaba</strong><strong> </strong><strong>yan</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Advice</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ko</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lang</strong><strong> </strong><strong>na</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i-pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>print</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>nalang.</strong></p><p></p><br />
