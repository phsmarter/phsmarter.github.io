                    <p>The Bridge of Love
 Have you ever looked into the night sky? Have you noticed a broad band of brightness across the entire sky? This band of stars is called Milky Way. It contains over 100 billion stars including our sun. The Chinese say that if you look into the night sky on the seventh month in the Chinese calendar, you would see very clearly this bridge of stars.
 A long time ago, there lived a powerful king in the Land of Stars. He was powerful. He was the mightiest ruler in the vast expanse of the skies. But the Land of Stars was not his important treasure. His most precious possession was his own daughter.
 The princess was beautiful and hardworking, loving, and obedient to her father. And she did one thing nobody else could do. She wove clouds on her loom every day. The clouds covered the sky and gave shelter to the people from the hot sun.
 It came pass that a handsome prince from a neighboring space kingdom visited the king. He was smitten by the princess’ beauty. He saw how respectful and obedient the princess was to her father. They fell in love with each other.
 The Prince asked for the Princess’ hand in marriage. The King agreed on one condition. The princess must continue weaving clouds even after her marriage. And the prince agreed. 
 But the young lovers forgot their promise. The princess spent days gathering heavenly flowers. She would dress herself with jewels of all kinds. The prince enjoyed the company of his beautiful bride. They would play, travel, and enjoy food and music all day long. The prince left his kingdom to his ministers and spent all his time with his princess. And they forgot to weave clouds on her loom.
 The king got angry. There were no more clouds to protect the people from the sun’s bright rays. People died from heat. There were no rains that watered the earth. Crops and animals died. With one wave of his wand, the king separated the lovers. He sent the prince to the northern skies, The River of Stars separated them. The lovers were very sad. They cried all hours of the day and flooded the earth with their cries.
 The magpies, a kind of bird, pitied the lovers. So, on the seventh month in the Chinese calendar, all magpies in the world form a bridge over the river. The lovers would meet and all the stars in the sky would twinkle with all their brightness as the lovers enjoy each other’s company.

 Have you ever looked into the night sky? Have you noticed a broad band of brightness across the entire sky? This band of stars is called Milky Way. It contains over 100 billion stars including our sun. The Chinese say that if you look into the night sky on the seventh month in the Chinese calendar, you would see very clearly this bridge of stars.

 The princess was beautiful and hardworking, loving, and obedient to her father. And she did one thing nobody else could do. She wove clouds on her loom every day. The clouds covered the sky and gave shelter to the people from the hot sun.
 It came pass that a handsome prince from a neighboring space kingdom visited the king. He was smitten by the princess’ beauty. He saw how respectful and obedient the princess was to her father. They fell in love with each other.
 The Prince asked for the Princess’ hand in marriage. The King agreed on one condition. The princess must continue weaving clouds even after her marriage. And the prince agreed.
