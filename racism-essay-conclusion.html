                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Racial Discrimination</strong></p><p></p><p>“The Urgency of Intersectionality” is written and was spoken by Kimberlé Crenshaw onTEDTalks on December 7, 2016. Kimberelé Crenshaw was born on May 5, 1959, and is anAmerican civil rights advocate and a leading scholar of critical race theory. She is also aprofessor at the UCLA School of Law and Columbia Law School where she specializes ingender and race issues. In the video, Kimberlé Crenshaw is talking about how the discriminationhas become more and deeper than just the race of an individual. Which results in going furtherinto the sex of the person. Throughout the video, Kimberlé Crenshaw argues how the public hasno “frame” or point of view and women of color are disregarded in discussions of racial andgender discrimination, and this has resulted in invisible prejudice.According to Kimberlé Crenshaw, intersectionality is how race, gender, class, and otherindividual or physical characteristics intersect with each other and create overlapping. KimberléCrenshaw says, “Many years ago, I began to use the term “intersectionality” to deal with the factthat many of our social justice problems like racism and sexism are often overlapping, creatingmultiple levels of social injustice” (00:4:54-00:5:08). Intersectionality creates interdependentsystems of discrimination and disadvantages. Kimberlé Crenshaw created this theory to explainthe oppression of African-American women. To explain this theory further, Kimberlé Crenshawgives an example of her own encounter with a woman named Emma Degraffenreid who was anAfrican-American woman, a working wife, and a mother. Kimberlé Crenshaw read aboutEmma’s story from the pages of legal opinion which was written by a judge who dismissed</p><br />

                            2. Essay about the end of racism​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>They say that you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, yet everyday people are judged just based on their skin color. The amount of melanin in my skin should not play a significant role in defining who I am. In today’s society, a person tends to discriminate against someone who may seem different due to their own narrow-minded concepts built up through living in a nation that has suffered from countless years of oppression and racial segregation. We are fundamentally more similar to one another than different; instead of building up walls to separate us, we should be building bridges to bring us closer together and leave behind years of mistreatment and shame towards those considered to be inferior.  However, pretending that race doesn’t exist will not solve the problem. Rather, we have to be willing to embrace our rich cultures and defy the prejudices and stereotypes.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Students are the future of any country, and as such, we need to strive to give a better education in not just math and science, but also in the world around us. Schools, such as my high school in Brentwood that has a minority percentage of more than 80%, should not be stereotyped. If only intellect were taken into account more often rather than relying on assumptions that we make about others without knowing them, society would be very different.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The ERASE Racism Student Leadership Forum was the tool that helped to enlighten me on topics related to racism. I was unaware of the housing discrimination many black Long Islanders suffered and the long-time segregated communities on Long Island, such as Levittown. To even think that segregation still exists is mindboggling, yet I find myself living in a community without the diversity I know we can all benefit from.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Racial and ethnic integration should be, and have been to an extent, implemented in various universities. Many now promote multicultural programs that allow people to embrace their own cultures, while sharing them with others. As a Hispanic, I feel Latinos have always received the rotten end of the deal, generally being blamed for the immigration problem. Therefore, multiracial programs that both allow us to be proud of our heritage and that bring together students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, would greatly benefit all of us, especially Latinos and African Americans who are often subjected to more negative stereotypes.  It would raise awareness that those stereotypes are not true and it would help motivate students to walk in the steps of important role models of color, such as Justice Sonia Sotomayor.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ultimately, the education system may serve as the key foundation for a more racially diverse and multicultural future. Racial equity is being demanded by immigrants who line the streets in Washington in hopes of immigration reform, and by African Americans who continue to fight for equal rights. I feel that I must perform the act of a defiant Hispanic girl and help create racial and ethnic bridges if I wish to see change in the world around me.  I hope that not too far away, we can fulfill the dream of Martin Luther King Jr. that “one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.'”</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Sorry if its long </p><p></p>The end of racism is a movement that began in the 1960s and has continued to this day. It has been a long, hard journey, but we are finally seeing progress. In particular, the past few years have seen an incredible increase in awareness about issues related to race and discrimination.<br />The civil rights movement was an important part of the process. The movement brought people together to fight for equality, and it helped to create a more just society where racism was no longer tolerated.<br />Now, though, we are seeing a shift in how people think about race relations in America.<br />We are beginning to see more open discussions about these issues, which is helping us get closer to realizing our goal of eliminating racism from our country's culture altogether!<br />

                            4. Write an essay:
Why is racism bad?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Racism can cause a lot of damage to both individuals and communities.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Individuals</strong>
</p><p>A study of over 800 Australian secondary school students found that racism had huge mental health impacts on young people who experience it, including:
</p><p>
</p>ongoing feelings of sadness, anger, depression and being left out
headaches, increased heart rate, sweating, trembling and muscle tension
a constant fear of being verbally or physically attacked
not wanting to go to school
having little or no trust in anybody apart from family. 1
<p>These impacts can reduce people's ability to work or study, and to achieve their future goals.
</p><p>
</p><p>Racism also affects people's general wellbeing when they are denied equal access to jobs, services and education.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Racism makes me question myself and why things have to be this way … I wondered one day what it would be like to be white and how much better my life would probably be. That was a low point."
</p><p>- Andrew, 19</p><p></p><p>Racism creates a society where people don't trust and respect each other.
</p><p>
</p><p>When it's allowed to flourish, it lessens us as a people. Remember the Stolen Generations… the White Australia policy… these are the ugly times in our history. We need to be vigilant in making sure that these kinds of things are never allowed to happen again.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being treated differently or unfairly because of our race, skin colour or ethnicity can negatively affect our mental health.</p><p></p><p>Racism can happen anywhere. It can happen at school, at work, or at home; it can happen online or outside; it can even happen within families and relationships. Sometimes racist abuse is obvious - verbal abuse about the way someone looks, stereotypes about how someone might behave, or physical violence and bullying, for example. Sometimes racism is part of the structures and systems that we live in. And sometimes racism is ‘subtle’ and difficult for other people to notice.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> </p><p>a/n: if you're white just pls don't say the n-word :)</p><p> hope it helps :))</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Racism is the process by which systems and policies, actions and attitudes create inequitable opportunities and outcomes for people based on race. Racism is more than just prejudice in thought or action. It occurs when this prejudice – whether individual or institutional – is accompanied by the power to discriminate against, oppress or limit the rights of others.</p><p></p><p>Race and racism have been central to the organisation of Australian society since European colonisation began in 1788. As the First Peoples of Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have borne the brunt of European colonisation and have a unique experience of racism. The process of colonisation, and the beliefs that underpin it, continue to shape Australian society today.</p><p></p><p>Racism adapts and changes over time, and can impact different communities in different ways, with racism towards different groups intensifying in different historical moments. An example of this is the spike in racism towards Asian and Asian-Australian people during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p></p><p>Racism includes all the laws, policies, ideologies and barriers that prevent people from experiencing justice, dignity, and equity because of their racial identity. It can come in the form of harassment, abuse or humiliation, violence or intimidating behaviour. However, racism also exists in systems and institutions that operate in ways that lead to inequity and injustice.</p><p></p><p>The Racism.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p> Bullying and racism are both harmful and unacceptable behaviors that have no place in our society. Bullying can cause emotional and physical harm to the victim, and it can lead to long-term consequences such as depression and anxiety. Racism, on the other hand, is a form of discrimination that can cause individuals to feel excluded and marginalized. It is important that we take a stand against these behaviors and promote kindness and respect towards all individuals, regardless of their race or background. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious society where everyone feels valued and accepted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>(pa brainliest)</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In every country everyone may have experience racism towards anyone about their face,body shape,color,and gender.We should end racism because it ruins others confidence and can cause them low steem or hating their self so in order to avoid their confidence being ruin or hating their self  we must stop racism.Because despite of our differences we were still the same humans.We need to have gender friendly environment in schools because everyone has the right to be who they are or who they wanna be  without anyone judging them because they also have feelings.Because at the end of the day we were all equal and everyone has the right to have freedom</p><br />
