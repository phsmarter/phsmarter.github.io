                        The Wedding Dance by Amador DaguioThis narrative demonstrates the highland Filipinos' culture.<p>It was a brief tale that took place on a mountain. The ritual around marriage, which served as the story's central topic, as well as the rich culture of the people who live in the northern Philippines were on display.</p><p></p><p><strong>Gongs</strong> were used, and the custom of <strong>dancing before or after the wedding </strong>was also demonstrated. The depiction of <strong>characters</strong> also reflects the culture of the Philippines, where women also engage in farming, which is amazing considering that men are expected to procreate.</p><p></p><p>As the characters in the story show respect for Apo Kabunian, the concept of belief in <strong>gods</strong> and <strong>goddesses</strong> was also presented. In the story, the importance of the character as a member of the community was also put to the test, but she still managed to maintain it. The protagonist decided to abide by the rules established by their community rather than challenging the <strong>elders</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the culture of the Filipino people is magnificent and one-of-a-kind, and it is still evident today.</p><p></p>Works of Literature by Jose RizalTo the Young Women of Malolos<p>In his letter To The Young Women of Malolos, Rizal thinks about his lineage and reminds Filipino women of important things. He addresses all different types of Filipino women in his letter, including moms, wives, and even single women. He emphasizes the traits ideal <strong>Filipino moms</strong> should have, the obligations of wives to their husbands and children, and advice for young women on how to select their life partners throughout this literary work. He was inspired to write this letter by the Malolos ladies who triumphed in the struggle they engaged in. Rizal counsels women to uphold their respect and dignity, pursue education, and lead honorable lives in order to set an example for others.</p><p></p>Kundiman<p>A man serenades the woman he loves in a love song known as a "kundiman." The Tagalog expression "Kung Hindi man" (if it should not be so), which implies that people put their faith in a Higher Being who chooses whether or not something is suited for them, is thought to be the source of this word by scholars. But Rizal expressed his fervent love for his <strong>motherland</strong> in a kundiman in his literary works. His sincere aspirations that the Philippines will one day be free from betrayal and injustice are reflected in this piece. He was in Europe at the time, and the nation was under serious threat. He also expresses his optimistic views through this art despite being far from his native nation.</p><p></p>Further explanation:<p>We are able to communicate with the <strong>authors' minds</strong> through Philippine literature. We have the capacity to see their concepts and become one with them. By using their writing style or the structure of their literary works, they may even influence the audience's thoughts. We will be able to <strong>appreciate</strong> them and their own abilities as Filipino authors if we read more local literature. Even better, by reading, we may learn from them and grow as authors while also refining our own critical thinking.</p><p></p><p>Our own literature offers us a tremendous amount of <strong>power</strong>. We acquire the ability to create, influence, and share, as well as to preserve. Local literary works are <strong>priceless</strong> jewels that we cannot replace; they retain their value over time and continue to inspire people even today. And as we gain a <strong>deeper understanding</strong> of them, we'll be better able to share the authors' legacies and encourage our fellow Filipinos to study Philippine literature as well.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, they link our souls as <strong>Filipinos</strong>. They act as gateways for examining our own cultural identities. Knowing oneself is being aware of your own culture. Each of us has the right to know who we are, and Filipino literature gives us the means to exercise this right. Additionally, it fosters one's own personal development and fosters interpersonal relationships. We'll be able to eliminate our colonial mindset and reawaken our nationalistic and patriotic hearts as we learn more about ourselves.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these, it enables us to access the past and travel back in time to significant historical occasions. But one can only truly unlock the past by in-depth investigation and extensive reading. We need to understand who we were before and how we came to be who we are today. similar to how a free nation was colonized and then set free by our ancestors. It would assist us in acknowledging what is necessary. Historical occurrences must be continuously appreciated in order to be more than just history. We might as well be able to catch a peek at a potential future since, as many people have said, history repeats itself.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Jose Rizal here: https://brainly.ph/question/6081752#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
