Quantitative research is not a scientific, experimental, or inductive manner of thinking. 2. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people selecting and studying samples from population. 3. Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondents. 4. Experimental research is the systematic investigation of the nature of the relationships or associations between and among variables without necessarily investigating into casual reasons underlying them 5. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnaire to collect measurable characteristic of the respondents. 6. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differences among variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research 7. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature, characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon. 8. Reliable quantitative studies cannot be repeated to verify or confirm its correctness in another setting 9. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample data gathered using a problem- solving technique. 10. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining a phenomenon is how research is started.​</a>

Quantitative research is not a scientific, experimental, or inductive manner of thinking. 2. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people selecting and studying samples from population. 3. Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondents. 4. Experimental research is the systematic investigation of the nature of the relationships or associations between and among variables without necessarily investigating into casual reasons underlying them 5. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnaire to collect measurable characteristic of the respondents. 6. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differences among variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research 7. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature, characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon. 8. Reliable quantitative studies cannot be repeated to verify or confirm its correctness in another setting 9. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample data gathered using a problem- solving technique. 10. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining a phenomenon is how research is started.​</h2><br />
