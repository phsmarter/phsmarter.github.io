John is a working student in SIC. His daily assignment is to clean classrooms in the 2nd Floor of the Amhrein Building. He is doing well in all his subjects except one subject – Ethics. One Monday, Mr. Dela Cruz, his instructor, announced that in the following week, they will have their 1st Major quiz in Ethics. He is anxious because he knows he does not perform well in class, though he takes down notes and listens very well during class lectures. On the dawn of Tuesday, as he was cleaning one of the classrooms, he saw a crumpled sheet of paper. It was an answered quiz on Ethics, however, coming from the class of the other Ethics instructor, Mr. Santos. He took the paper and planned on making it as a review material for the coming quiz. The day of the scheduled quiz came. John was shocked because the quiz that he found which came from Mr. Santos’s class, and which he utilized as a review material, is the very same quiz that Mr. Dela Cruz is giving to them. What should John do? Should he tell Mr. Dela Cruz about the quiz from Mr. Santos’ class that he found while cleaning, or should he proceed in answering the quiz since it is not his fault that the same quiz is given by two different instructors?

                                            ENGLISH MELC 21: Give expanded definitions of words. Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it. Formal Definition ng maile others iso Sense of humor is the ability to laugh and make others laugh ↓ A formal definition consists of three parts: the term being defined, the class it belongs to, and its distinguishing characteristics. An informal definition explains an unfamiliar term using synonyms or antonyms introduced by or, in other words, or ike. Take note of how the term sense of humor was defined. Term Class Distinguishing Characteristics Sense of Humor Informal Definition Sense of humor means to appreciate a joke or to perce ve humor ↓ Since expanding basic formal definitions means explaining the differentiating characteristics thoroughly, the following questions may serve as framework: Synonyms What does it do? How is it used? - How does it work? What are its parts? Can it be compared to anything familiar? What is its origin and background? UN techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions listed below may be of great help in answering the aforementioned questions. Be aware, however, that the technique/s to be used will depend on what is appropriate for the term you are trying to define or explain. ​</a>

John is a working student in SIC. His daily assignment is to clean classrooms in the 2nd Floor of the Amhrein Building. He is doing well in all his subjects except one subject – Ethics. One Monday, Mr. Dela Cruz, his instructor, announced that in the following week, they will have their 1st Major quiz in Ethics. He is anxious because he knows he does not perform well in class, though he takes down notes and listens very well during class lectures. On the dawn of Tuesday, as he was cleaning one of the classrooms, he saw a crumpled sheet of paper. It was an answered quiz on Ethics, however, coming from the class of the other Ethics instructor, Mr. Santos. He took the paper and planned on making it as a review material for the coming quiz. The day of the scheduled quiz came. John was shocked because the quiz that he found which came from Mr. Santos’s class, and which he utilized as a review material, is the very same quiz that Mr. Dela Cruz is giving to them. What should John do? Should he tell Mr. Dela Cruz about the quiz from Mr. Santos’ class that he found while cleaning, or should he proceed in answering the quiz since it is not his fault that the same quiz is given by two different instructors?

                            30. ENGLISH MELC 21: Give expanded definitions of words. Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it.
