Perseverance</p><p>8. Camaraderie</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>The statement on #8 is incomplete so I assume the answer would be "Camaraderie" since it's the only word which haven't been answered on the previous questions. As for #3 and #6, it's 50% confusing since the idea was that of "compassion."In other words,<strong> </strong>both statements<strong> </strong>implicate<strong> </strong><strong>generosity</strong> and <strong>helpfulness</strong>  but on different degree since the latter's concept isn't on the same intensity of that word "<strong>generosity</strong>". Hence, I answered 'generosity' on #3 since it tells philanthropy in general not just on the poor but to those people who are in need. On #6, it's helpfulness (I think) since it  says helping humanity in times of calamities. </p><p></p><p>#<strong>Brainlybunch</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
