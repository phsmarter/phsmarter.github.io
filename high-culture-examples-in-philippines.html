                                            Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</a>

back as two milennia ago in the precolonial Philippines. They are found in the
remote areas of the Philippine Cordillera mountain range on the northern island
of Luzon, Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area.
The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces
located in four municipalities. They are all the products of Ifugao ethnic group.o
minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural
landscape of beauty beyond compare.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to
mankind. They were built 2,000 years ago and passed on through generations
and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by
modernization
Built on steeper lopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the
natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terrace have complex imigation
systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops.
The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole
community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of
biological resources which exist in the Ifugao Agri-ecosystem.
Questions:
1. What makes the Rice Terraces extraordinary?
2. Why do you think the Ifugao built the Rice Terraces?
3. How do the Rice Terraces reflect the culture of the liugao?

Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – Outstanding Universal Value
The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far as two millennia ago in the pre-colonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippines Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, the Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all products of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years.
The five clusters are: (1) the Nagacadan terrace clusters in the municipality of Kiangan, in two distinctive rows of terraces divided by a river; (2) the Hungduan terrace cluster shaped like a spider web; (3) the central Mayoyao terrace cluster characterized by terraces in intervals with the traditional bale (houses) and alang (granaries); (4) the Bangaan terrace cluster in Banaue, the background of a typical Ifugao village; and (5) the Batad terrace cluster of Banaue that lies in semicircular terraces with a village at its base.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2, 000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization.

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

                            12. Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</h2><br />

Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras – Outstanding Universal Value
The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an outstanding example of a developed, living cultural landscape. They can be traced as far as two millennia ago in the pre-colonial Philippines. They are found in the remote areas of the Philippines Cordillera mountain range on the northern island of Luzon, the Philippine archipelago. These historic terraces cover an extensive area. The property consists of five clusters of the most intact and impressive terraces located in four municipalities. They are all products of the Ifugao ethnic group, a minority community that has lived on these mountains for thousands of years.
The five clusters are: (1) the Nagacadan terrace clusters in the municipality of Kiangan, in two distinctive rows of terraces divided by a river; (2) the Hungduan terrace cluster shaped like a spider web; (3) the central Mayoyao terrace cluster characterized by terraces in intervals with the traditional bale (houses) and alang (granaries); (4) the Bangaan terrace cluster in Banaue, the background of a typical Ifugao village; and (5) the Batad terrace cluster of Banaue that lies in semicircular terraces with a village at its base.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are an ideal example of a living cultural landscape of beauty beyond compare.
The Ifugao Rice Terraces are valuable contributions of our ancestors to mankind. They were built 2, 000 years ago and passed on through generations and an example of an ancient civilization that overcame challenges passed by modernization.
Built on steeper slopes of high mountains and the careful carving of the natural shapes of the hills, the Ifugao Rice Terraces have complex irrigation systems. Water comes from the forests of the mountain tops.
The maintenance of the living rice terraces shows that the whole community works as one. It is based on the knowledge of the rich variety of biological resources which exist in the Ifugao agri-ecosystem.

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."
