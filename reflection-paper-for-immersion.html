It is sometrhing that one will remember in the near future. And if it has impacted you a lot, it might be a motivation to pursue nursing as your profession.</p><p>           Given the chance in the work immersion to be a nurse made me realize how tiring and serious the job is. Monitoring the patients, roaming around giving medicines, checking vital signs, updating progress and a lot more. However, Apart from all of these, is the realization that, at the end of the day, you were able to help save lives, you were able to put smiles after pains and most importantly, you were abe to fulfill your promised duties.</p><p>            For me, these reflections openned up my mind to be more open-minded.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Wow, what can I say about Immersion? First of all, you have to be there to really understand what a profound experience it is. My in-laws were visiting when I got back from Immersion and I found it very difficult to explain the experience. What I told them is that it was an intensive program (like a retreat) focused on building an information literacy program (well, it is in the program track, though the teacher track is more focused on developing an approach to teaching). But it was so much more than that. It was a time of intense reflection on where we’ve been, what we’ve been doing, where we want to go, and what we need to do to get there. It was about developing the persuasive skills to realize our goals. I recognized many missteps I’d made in the past and saw my future path so much more clearly at the end of Immersion that I now feel a renewed sense of purpose. It was like a vision quest minus the peyote.</p><p></p><p>Immersion was exhausting. You barely had time to stop and think since you were constantly engaged in activities or doing “homework.” But it was also exhilarating, because you were constantly hearing things that made fireworks go off in your brain. “Oh my gosh, we could totally do that at my library!” After being back at work for 3 hours, I’d already used an idea from Immersion for changing our student orientation program. This year we’re getting 26 groups of about 30 students each coming to the library for around 40 minutes each. My cohort leader (the fabulous Tiffini Travis) gave me the idea to break the students into groups and have each group find out about certain parts of the library and then share that information with the entire class. Brilliant! </p><p></p><p>Immersion was also about breaking down one of our biggest barriers: ourselves. Never underestimate the power of denial and procrastination! I think my biggest epiphany came when we were discussing a case study we’d been assigned to read. It was about Dorothy, the first instruction coordinator at her institution, and the missteps she made in her first few years on the job. I realized when I was talking about the mistakes she’d made, I was getting really annoyed. And then I realized why. I’d made many of those same mistakes. I was Dorothy! It made me see my own role in a new light and helped me realize that I’d been avoiding some of the same things (being more involved in the University outside of the library, focusing on staff development). Those realizations really informed my action plan and will inform all of my work this year as instruction coordinator. After talking to many of my fellow program-track colleagues, I realized that I was not the only one who’d had that epiphany, so it was definitely a good experience to break down our own denial.</p><p></p><p>One of the things I loved best were the variety of group and individual experiences. Sometimes we were listening to a lecture in a big room. Sometimes we were participating in small group discussions/activities. Sometimes we were doing individual work. Sometimes we were molding stuff with clay and doing skits wearing snorkeling gear. I absolutely loved working with my cohort; we are all dealing with diverse and complex situations and it was really nice to discuss this stuff with people who are equally passionate about user-centered info lit instruction. I really hope to keep in touch with these inspiring professionals.</p><p></p><br />

We reflect as we research and explore new ideas, skills.</p><p></p>Reflection of immersion<p></p><p>Having the immersion was really a good start to experience how does it feel to be in a work place. In my case, I was so to fortunate enough to have my immersion at the bank because in the strand of ABM, only the few of us were able to be accepted to have our immersion there because banks don't usually accept OJTs.</p><p></p><br />

Yet, unlike a game, the stakes of this particular contest are much higher. “Winning” a job not only provides the victor with material comfort, in the form of salary, benefits, and the like, but also with confidence in their academic credentials and future. With such an important outcome riding on the often mysterious decisions of search committees, it is unsurprising that the night I spent reflecting upon my coming interviews was so long (though to give away the ending of what could have been a good story, I did not get a job).<p></p>The most important lesson I learned during my interviews is the need to be flexible. Each interview required that I emphasize different parts of my historical training. The questions I answered varied enormously. One committee asked a set list of questions, inquiring about such things as my favorite historians and how these individuals most influenced my work; other committees tested me on how to design an online class and to what extent I was planning on incorporating electronic media into my teaching. I found that discussions regarding pedagogy revealed much about the expected “fit” of the new hire into a department<br />

The study focuses on the experiences of students from low-income families, immigrant families, and students with disabilities. The research methodology employed was qualitative, using interviews, observations, and document analysis to gather data. The study found that inquiries, investigation, and immersion are effective tools in understanding the educational needs of marginalized students. By engaging in these methods, researchers were able to gain a deeper understanding of the students' experiences, challenges, and strengths. The study also highlights the importance of cultural responsiveness in inquiry-based research and the need for ongoing collaboration between researchers and community stakeholders.</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of inquiries, investigation, and immersion in educational research. These methods involve engaging with the community, observing and documenting the experiences of individuals, and gathering data through interviews, surveys, and focus groups. The purpose of this research paper is to explore the role of inquiries, investigation, and immersion in understanding the educational needs of marginalized students. Specifically, the study focuses on students from low-income families, immigrant families, and students with disabilities. The research methodology employed was qualitative, using interviews, observations, and document analysis to gather data.</p><p></p><p>Literature Review:</p><p>The literature on inquiries, investigation, and immersion in educational research highlights the importance of community engagement and cultural responsiveness. These methods involve working closely with community stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences, challenges, and strengths of marginalized students. Studies have shown that inquiries and investigation can lead to a more nuanced understanding of the educational needs of marginalized students and can inform the development of culturally responsive teaching practices (Banks, 2006; Gay, 2010). Immersion, on the other hand, involves spending time in the community and observing the experiences of individuals firsthand. This method has been shown to be particularly effective in understanding the experiences of immigrant and refugee students (Suarez-Orozco et al., 2010).</p><p></p><p>Methodology:</p><p>The study employed a qualitative research methodology, using inquiries, investigation, and immersion to gather data. The research was conducted in a school district with a high percentage of students from low-income families, immigrant families, and students with disabilities. The researchers conducted interviews with students, parents, teachers, and community stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of marginalized students. They also observed classrooms and school activities to document the experiences of students and teachers. In addition, the researchers analyzed documents such as school policies and curriculum materials to gain a broader understanding of the educational context.</p><p></p><p>Results:</p><p>The study found that inquiries, investigation, and immersion were effective tools in understanding the educational needs of marginalized students. By engaging in these methods, researchers were able to gain a deeper understanding of the students' experiences, challenges, and strengths. For example, through interviews with students, researchers were able to gain insights into the challenges faced by students from immigrant families, such as language barriers and cultural differences. Through observations of classrooms, researchers were able to identify areas where teachers could improve their cultural responsiveness.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The study highlights the importance of inquiries, investigation, and immersion in understanding the educational needs of marginalized students. These methods are particularly effective in gaining a deeper understanding of the experiences, challenges, and strengths of students from low-income families, immigrant families, and students with disabilities. The study also underscores the importance of cultural responsiveness in inquiry-based research and the need for ongoing collaboration between researchers and community stakeholders. By engaging in these methods, researchers can develop more effective interventions and teaching practices that are responsive to the needs of marginalized students.</p><p></p><p>Regenerate</p><p>Ask question here...</p><p>Send</p><p></p><p></p><p>BingGPT April 16 Version.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>nternships are a rapidly expanding educational technique to enhance students' ability to learn. Internships permit and encourage students to experience
</p><p>the real world while receiving academic credit. Seekonk
</p><p>High School in Seekonk, Massachusetts, has an internship program for high school seniors called Independent
</p><p>Study. It allows students to leave school one day a week
</p><p>for the school year and volunteer within the community.
</p><p>Students receive academic credit for their participation
</p><p>in community service learning.
</p><p>Seekonk's program follows the educational principle
</p><p>that people learn best by doing. The program is voluntary and students make their own explorations and decisions. They do not learn by memorizing a set of facts, but
</p><p>learn to give of themselves. Participants often soon realize that it is all right to have feelings and to act upon
</p><p>them and that some of the best experiences one has in
</p><p>life must be felt with the heart.
</p><p>Knowing and clarifying our values is an endless process. It is challenging, but rewarding. When we begin to
</p><p>know our values, we become more productive and purposeful. We know what is important to us and we feel a
</p><p>zest for what we do. We often learn that life is precious
</p><p>and is worth the effort of living it to the maximum. We
</p><p>hopefully learn more consideration for our fellow human beings.
</p><p>Internships also assist people in their decisionmaking. Through practical experience, we learn to make
</p><p>choices that are honest and valuable to our own needs.
</p><p>We learn to act with conviction and give ourselves permission to do what is important to us. High school seniors are at one of the most important decisionmaking
</p><p>points in their lives. They are trying to decide where
