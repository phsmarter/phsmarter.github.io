                                            Can someone add an explanation about this paragraph: 
Quality is measure of excellence or a state of being free from defects, deficiencies and significant variations. It is brought about by strict and consistent commitment to certain standards that achieve uniformity of a product in order to satisfy specific customer or user requirements while quantity is the extent, size, or sum of countable or measurable discrete events, objects, or phenomenon, expressed as a numerical value. In tourism field quality is more important than quantity. For example when going to fast food, it's typically about quantity, whereas going to a restaurant is more about quality. It's the same with certain products, it's nice to have better quality products rather than a certain amount of products. </a>

It is brought about by strict and consistent commitment to certain standards that achieve uniformity of a product in order to satisfy specific customer or user requirements while quantity is the extent, size, or sum of countable or measurable discrete events, objects, or phenomenon, expressed as a numerical value. In tourism field quality is more important than quantity. For example when going to fast food, it's typically about quantity, whereas going to a restaurant is more about quality. It's the same with certain products, it's nice to have better quality products rather than a certain amount of products. </h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Costs as a Function of Production Experience:</p><p>Costs as a function of production experience refer to the changes in production costs that occur as a result of gaining experience and increasing production volume. As a company produces more units of a product, it becomes more efficient in its production process, which can lead to lower costs per unit. This is known as economies of scale.</p><p></p><p>For example, let's consider a car manufacturing company. When the company initially starts producing cars, it may face higher costs due to limited production volume and lack of experience. However, as the company gains experience and increases its production volume, it may benefit from economies of scale, resulting in lower costs per car. The company may negotiate better deals with suppliers, invest in more efficient production equipment, and optimize its production processes, which can all lead to reduced costs. As a result, the company may be able to offer its cars at a lower price or increase its profit margin.</p><p></p><p>2. Costs Plus Pricing:</p><p></p><p>Costs plus pricing is a pricing strategy where a standard markup is added to the costs of a product to determine its selling price. The markup is typically a percentage of the production costs and is intended to cover overheads, profit margin, and other costs associated with selling the product.</p><p></p><p>Benefits of Costs Plus Pricing:</p><p></p><p>a) Certainty about Costs: Costs plus pricing provides sellers with a clear understanding of their production costs and ensures that these costs are covered in the selling price. This helps sellers to avoid selling products at a loss and ensures that they can cover their expenses.</p><p></p><p>b) Similar Prices in the Industry and Minimized Price Competition: Costs plus pricing can result in similar prices among competitors in the industry. Since the markup is standard, it minimizes price competition as sellers are not undercutting each other's prices. This can result in more stable pricing in the industry and reduce the need for constant price adjustments.</p><p></p><p>c) Perception of Fairness by Buyers: Buyers may perceive costs plus pricing as fair because the price is based on the actual production costs of the product, and the markup is a standard percentage. This can create a sense of transparency and trust between buyers and sellers.</p><p></p><p>3. Disadvantages of Costs Plus Pricing:</p><p></p><p>a) Ignores Demand and Competitor Prices: Costs plus pricing does not take into account demand for the product or competitor prices. It solely relies on the production costs and a fixed markup, which may not accurately reflect market demand or competitive pricing. This can result in pricing that may not be optimal in terms of maximizing profits or capturing market share.</p><p></p><p>b) Lack of Flexibility: Costs plus pricing can be inflexible as it may not allow for quick adjustments in pricing based on changes in market conditions or demand fluctuations. This can result in missed opportunities or lost sales if the pricing does not align with market realities.</p><p></p><p>c) Potential for Overpricing or Underpricing: Costs plus pricing may not always result in optimal pricing. If the markup is too high, it may lead to overpricing, resulting in reduced demand or lost sales. On the other hand, if the markup is too low, it may result in underpricing, leading to lower profit margins. Finding the right balance between costs and markup can be challenging.</p><p></p><br />
