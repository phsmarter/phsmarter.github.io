Statistics show that inStates with capital punishment, murder rates are the same or almost the same as instates without capital punishment. It is also true that it is more expensive to put aperson on death row than in life imprisonment because of the costs of maximumsecurity. Unfortunately, capital punishment has been used unjustly. Statistics showthat every execution is of a man and that nine out of ten are black. So prejudiceshows right through2. Sunday is my favorite day of the week. I like it because on Sunday, I watch footballOn the other days, I also get to watch football but not all day. There are other sportson other days to watch on TV.

Mr. Sweet always made the narrator feel special. Sheloved to be around him and was overjoyed whenever he would visit her. Mr Sweetplayed with the children just as if he were a child himself. Mr. Sweet also displayed agreat deal of respect for the narrator and her family. Even though his alcoholism andlifestyle was a bad influence on the children, his virtues far outweighed his faults.

Mr. Sweet's lifestyle did not make him an excellent role model for thechildren, but he was always an excellent companion.The motive of the fictional autobiographers of Charlotte Bronte's novels must havebeen to "sum" and existence, "bound" a life, and find safety in the "strait limits" of anenclosed mind. Because all three autobiographers, William Crimsworth, Jane Eyreand Lucy Snowe, seem to need oversimplify both their own natures and the worldsin which they live in. They are all different, however, they go and do it in basically thesame way! Repressing what her more instinctual impulses tell her about the complextruths of experience, this is how they generate personal mythologies by which torationalize their lives.Club Palm Resort's isolation created dissatisfaction among some vacationers.

Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chi, is going tocommence operations against Chwan-yu."3. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here?4. "Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over thesacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; and itsruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do withattacking it?5. Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.6. Confucius said, "Ch iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, "When he can put forth his abilty,he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retiresfrom it. how can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen? "And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when atortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?"8. Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief does not now takeit, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants."9. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, the superior man hates that declining to say"I want such and such a thing." and framing explanations for the conduct.10. "I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.11. "So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, theymust be made contented and tranquil.12. "Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory, there are divisions anddownfalls, leavings and separations, and, wilh your help, he cannot preserve it.13. "And yet, he is planning these hostile movements within the State.-I am afraid that the sorrow bof the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen oftheir own court."Chapter II.1. Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitivemilitary expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire,ceremonies, musiC, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these thingsproceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power inten generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the princes, as a rule, the cases willbe few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers ofthe great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in whichthey do not lose their power in three generations.4. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the Greatofficers.3. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the commonpeople."Book XVIII. Wei TszeChapter I1. The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pkan remonstrated with him and died.2. Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue"Chapter IIHui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Someone said to him "Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this" he replied, "Serving men in an upright waywhere shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? if choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?Source: James Legge (translator), The Chinese Classics, volume 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893​</a>

His adoptive parents named him Clark Kent and reared him well. In the same generation, far away in Gotham, Bruce Wayne, the future Batman, was born to a contented, wealthy family. Tragically, his parents were killed in his presence during a mugging. He inherited the family wealth and was raised by his kindly butler. Those very different backgrounds provided Superman and Batman with powerful but different motives for fighting crime. Superman was programmed in his space capsule to know about the forces of good and evil on Earth and to fight the bad people. Unlike Superman, Batman learned from experience.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During my high school career, I had some great experiences. However, some of them were quite the contrary. It is times like this that allo me to appreciate the finer things in life.</p><p>             </p><p>             My experience happened in a warm day in May. I had just bought a blue dress for my Senior Class Banquet, which was on this day. My head was aching a little, but I took an aspirin and didn.t give it muc thought. I decided to take a little nap so I could be well rested for this special occasion.</p><p>             </p><p>             I woke up at 3 o'clock that afternoon. The little headache that I had before I went to sleep had progressed to an excrutiating migraine. It was like I was paralyzed to the bed. I couldn't lift my head from the pillow. I was to be the presenter at the Senior Banquet, but there was no way I could make it in my condition.</p><p>             </p><p>             An hour before the ceremony was to begin, my best friend called me and I told him of my condition. He was sympathetic and graciously agreed to accept my awards in my honor. Being the great friend that he is, he also agreed to pick up my cue cards and do the necessary presenting for me.</p><p>             </p><p>             Though the experience was one of the worst for me, I don't dwell on it. It has ultimately allowed me to appreciate all of the small things I take for granted.</p><p></p><p>Hope this helps :))</p><br />

</p><p>
</p><p> I've finally worked up the courage to tell you about the main cause of my depression and the other mental illnesses from which I've been suffering. I'm going to show you a very important part of myself, and I chose to do so because I trust you more than any other friend I have. I made this decision because I want you to get to know me as a whole person. I made the decision because the burden was becoming too much for me to bear. I'm writing you this letter because I adore you and am in desperate need of your help now more than ever.
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm writing you this letter with the possibility that our friendship is coming to an end. I understand that long discussions, amusing conflicts, emotional messages, crazy laughs, sincere hugs, strange jokes, social media tags, phone calls, and other sweet things we used to have may come to an end. I shared incredible moments with you, and you gradually became a member of my family; you always felt like a brother to me, and I am grateful to God for the gift of having you in my life.</p><br />

                        Paragraph 1 (Introduction):<br /><br />Leo Tolstoy's "The Two Brothers" is a short story about two brothers who inherit their father's farm and learn to deal with their conflicting personalities and desires. The story is set in the countryside of Russia during the 19th century and explores themes of family, responsibility, and the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />Paragraph 2 (Body):<br /><br />The main characters in "The Two Brothers" are not related to me, but I found their personalities relatable in many ways. While one brother is driven by a desire for success and wealth, the other is content with a simple life. This dichotomy reminded me of my own experiences with family and friends who have different priorities and values.<br />The setting of the story is effective in creating a vivid picture of life in rural Russia during the 19th century. Tolstoy's descriptions of the countryside and the changing seasons help to bring the story to life. For example, when describing the winter landscape, Tolstoy writes: "The white, untrodden snow stretched over the whole valley, reflecting the rays of the sun, and its cold, sparkling crystals seemed to penetrate the very soul."<br />The plot of "The Two Brothers" is interesting, but it may not be to everyone's taste. The story is slow-paced and focuses on the inner lives of the characters, rather than action or suspense. However, this allows for a deeper exploration of the themes of family, responsibility, and happiness. The climax of the story is unexpected and provides a satisfying conclusion.<br />The conflict in "The Two Brothers" is clear and realistic, as it deals with the struggle between two brothers who have different ideas about how to run their farm. This conflict is something that many people can relate to, as it is common for family members to have different goals and desires.<br />The theme of "The Two Brothers" is that happiness cannot be found through wealth and material possessions alone. This is demonstrated through the contrast between the two brothers, one of whom values success and wealth, while the other is content with a simple life. The story suggests that true happiness comes from living a fulfilling life that is in line with one's values and priorities.<br />Paragraph 3 (Conclusion):<br /><br />Overall, "The Two Brothers" is a well-written and thought-provoking story that explores important themes related to family, responsibility, and happiness. While it may not be to everyone's taste, the slow pace and emphasis on character development allow for a deeper exploration of these themes. The story has enduring value, as it provides a timeless lesson about the importance of living a fulfilling life that is true to one's values.<br />

Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chi, is going tocommence operations against Chwan-yu."3. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here?4. "Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over thesacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; and itsruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do withattacking it?5. Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.6. Confucius said, "Ch iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, "When he can put forth his abilty,he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retiresfrom it. how can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen? "And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when atortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?"8. Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief does not now takeit, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants."9. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, the superior man hates that declining to say"I want such and such a thing." and framing explanations for the conduct.10. "I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.11. "So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, theymust be made contented and tranquil.12. "Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory, there are divisions anddownfalls, leavings and separations, and, wilh your help, he cannot preserve it.13. "And yet, he is planning these hostile movements within the State.-I am afraid that the sorrow bof the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen oftheir own court."Chapter II.1. Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitivemilitary expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire,ceremonies, musiC, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these thingsproceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power inten generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the princes, as a rule, the cases willbe few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers ofthe great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in whichthey do not lose their power in three generations.4. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the Greatofficers.3. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the commonpeople."Book XVIII. Wei TszeChapter I1. The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pkan remonstrated with him and died.2. Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue"Chapter IIHui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Someone said to him "Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this" he replied, "Serving men in an upright waywhere shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? if choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?Source: James Legge (translator), The Chinese Classics, volume 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893​</h2><br />

Both Superman and Batman are heroes, but only one is truly a superhero, and taking into account their upbringing, motives, and criminal targets, that is Batman. Upbringing was not gentle for either. Superman came from Krypton, a planet that was about to self-destruct. His parents sent him as a baby on a spaceship to Earth. There he would be adopted by an ordinary farm family. His adoptive parents named him Clark Kent and reared him well. In the same generation, far away in Gotham, Bruce Wayne, the future Batman, was born to a contented, wealthy family. Tragically, his parents were killed in his presence during a mugging. He inherited the family wealth and was raised by his kindly butler. Those very different backgrounds provided Superman and Batman with powerful but different motives for fighting crime. Superman was programmed in his space capsule to know about the forces of good and evil on Earth and to fight the bad people. Unlike Superman, Batman learned from experience. Both have gone on to fight many bad people, but each one has a special enemy. For Superman, it is Luthor, who has studied Superman and knows all about him, even his outstanding weakness-the mineral Kryptonite. For Batman, it is the Joker, who, as a wicked teenager, was the mugger-murderer of his parents. Many spectacular battles have ensued for both crime fighters, and one has reached the top in his profession. Superman offers overwhelming physical strength against crime, but Batman displays cunning and base passion. As he strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked, he's not just winning, he is getting even.
