                        A Book About my Life in the Time of Covid-19<p></p>My Experience as a Student in Distant Learning<p>          I will never forget that day, it was one normal morning, and then suddenly it was locked down. I have been hearing the news about Covid-19 from other countries as well as ours since before the day of the lockdown. My classmates and I never really made a big deal out of it, not until the announcement that there will be a total lockdown. I was a third year high school that time, and trying my best to get an award.</p><p>          I was terrified. I never thought that the disease was that worse. We had to adjust our learning since we do not have the face to face classes. My classmates and I were far away from one another, and it was very hard for me. I do not know how to adjust to distant and modular learning. I couldn’t ask anyone of my classmates when I do not understand the lesson. It was a long before I could finally be able to adjust. </p><p>          There was also this one time where my brother got infected with Covid-19. He was too sick to move but thank God he was able to overcome it. So to be safe, my mother made a schedule for us to get vaccinated. I was scared at first, I got chills that same night I got vaccinated but now I feel fine. I worked hard to adjust with the distant learning, to compromise with the requirements needed, and now I am waiting for that face-to-face recognition day for all the fruits of my hard work in studies. </p><p>          Today, thank God, face-to-face classes are starting again. I can finally bond with my classmates. I can finally ask my classmate or my teacher when I want to clarify something about the lesson. I can finally hear their voice in person and communicate better. All in all, it was a mixed feelings kind of experience. I am just thankful that the people I know are safe from Covid-19. </p><p></p><p><strong>For More Information</strong></p><p>Modular Learning:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/12441798</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p>As a student, I have had the opportunity to use and create multimodal texts in a variety of contexts. In English class, for example, I have used multimedia elements such as images and videos to enhance my written essays and presentations, adding depth and clarity to my arguments. I have also used multimedia tools like Prezi and Canva to create more visually engaging and interactive presentations for class projects. In addition, I have had the chance to collaborate with my peers on group projects that involved creating multimedia presentations, where we combined text, audio, and video to communicate our ideas effectively. Overall, my experience with multimodal texts has allowed me to express myself in more dynamic and creative ways, and has helped me to better engage my audience and convey my message.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I guess what I like about online learning is that its very new to me to explore the fundamental in a e-learning. Online learning or online class is a great way to lessen the amount of time you go outside the house. Its very need in this time of pandemic for us students to continue to learn even in the safety of our home.</p><p></p><p>I think what I dont like about online learning is that i cannot physically communicate to my classmates and sometimes i feel Isolated at my own room feels like no one to talk to. That's what I feel in online learning when Im still a beginner.</p><p>But later own I find a way to enjoy it by watching tips and ways in a online learning class.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion being on online class is a different road since you cannot contact physically with your co-students and being a first timer in online class is a different world to open. </p><p>We are not trained and we are not prepared for this. Some of the students failed because of this we didnt expect how hard if you are not prepared  in a online class. Since most of us love a face to face class.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion we should slowly follow or obey this type of learning because its a pandemic, we should be flexible in learning since its the only way to survive in this 21st century. </p><p>This is also effective, as long as you participate at it you will learned to enjoy it and love it. And when that happens you will know how convienient it is to have an online learning thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
