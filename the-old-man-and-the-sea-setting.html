                                            The Three Brothers and the Pot of PorridgeThree brothers were traveling through the dense rain forest jungle. They had been traveling on foot for almost a full day and night was falling. They needed a suitable place to rest for the night, a place where they would be safe from prowling animals of the night.They were in luck because before darkness fell, they spotted a little isolated hut in the distance. When they arrived at the hut, they met a kindly old woman who invited them in and offered them a place to spend the night.The old woman offered them some porridge which she was cooking in an iron pot over some firewood. The brothers declined for they were very exhausted and also did not want to impose on this old woman who living alone, had cooked enough porridge only for one person.The old woman gave them some mats and showed them into a room where they could lay down and have a good night’s rest. Soon, the entire hut was dark and everyone in it was asleep.Sometime in the night, the youngest of the three brothers woke up and he was very hungry. His older brothers had declined the offer of some supper and he had just gone along, but he was really hungry. So he went out into the kitchen to see if any of the porridge remained and indeed, there was enough porridge in there for one person. It appeared that the old woman had not eaten any of it, she must have been keeping it for the next day. It wouldn’t harm anybody if he ate just a little bit of it, and it would certainly do him a lot of good. So he ate a little bit. Then a little bit more, and even more until it was all gone. Realizing his folly, he decided to cover it up and went out to pick some stones to put in the pot. He hoped the old woman would not notice.The three brothers were up early the next morning to continue on their journey. They bade farewell to the old woman and thanked her for her kindness.The old woman discovered the stones in her pot soon after the brothers left and immediately set out after them. Even though she was very old, she could move as fast, or maybe even faster than any young man since she was able to catch up with the three young men.She accused them of stealing her porridge and filling her pot with stones, at which the eldest brother who spoke for them sincerely denied. The old woman though was certain that one of them performed the deed, so she challenged them to take a test. They went to a nearby river which had a log laying across it. Each one of them would walk across the river on the log while singing a song which the woman taught to them. They would each sing this song in Yoruba:Ti m ba je koko arugboIf I ate the the old woman’s cocoyamKi okun gbe mi, ki okun la miLet the sea take meKi okun gbe mi si erigidi ofunLet the sea take me The first two brothers walked confidently across the river singing the song. But the youngest brother was so scared as he walked and sang. His step faltered several times and he eventually fell into the riverevent 1: event 2:event 3:event 4:​</a>

STORY:
THE ‘SINGA’ 
Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and
wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart.
Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving
the king a shock...but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only
grazing the animal. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag
up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand- an island. Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him.
“What is the name of that island?” The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.”
“Then we are going there.” The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship
carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning. However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his
grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his
crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown
immediately and threw it into the sea. All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear
and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and
the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and
moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red
body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden
eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle.
“What sort of animal was that?”, the king asked. A wise old man stepped forth.
I have seen animals in portraits from the Far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.”
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live
here...here in the island of Singapura.”</a>

                                            The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</a>

 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

                                            The Three Brothers and the Pot of PorridgeThree brothers were traveling through the dense rain forest jungle. They had been traveling on foot for almost a full day and night was falling. They needed a suitable place to rest for the night, a place where they would be safe from prowling animals of the night.They were in luck because before darkness fell, they spotted a little isolated hut in the distance. When they arrived at the hut, they met a kindly old woman who invited them in and offered them a place to spend the night.The old woman offered them some porridge which she was cooking in an iron pot over some firewood. The brothers declined for they were very exhausted and also did not want to impose on this old woman who living alone, had cooked enough porridge only for one person.The old woman gave them some mats and showed them into a room where they could lay down and have a good night’s rest. Soon, the entire hut was dark and everyone in it was asleep.Sometime in the night, the youngest of the three brothers woke up and he was very hungry. His older brothers had declined the offer of some supper and he had just gone along, but he was really hungry. So he went out into the kitchen to see if any of the porridge remained and indeed, there was enough porridge in there for one person. It appeared that the old woman had not eaten any of it, she must have been keeping it for the next day. It wouldn’t harm anybody if he ate just a little bit of it, and it would certainly do him a lot of good. So he ate a little bit. Then a little bit more, and even more until it was all gone. Realizing his folly, he decided to cover it up and went out to pick some stones to put in the pot. He hoped the old woman would not notice.The three brothers were up early the next morning to continue on their journey. They bade farewell to the old woman and thanked her for her kindness.The old woman discovered the stones in her pot soon after the brothers left and immediately set out after them. Even though she was very old, she could move as fast, or maybe even faster than any young man since she was able to catch up with the three young men.She accused them of stealing her porridge and filling her pot with stones, at which the eldest brother who spoke for them sincerely denied. The old woman though was certain that one of them performed the deed, so she challenged them to take a test. They went to a nearby river which had a log laying across it. Each one of them would walk across the river on the log while singing a song which the woman taught to them. They would each sing this song in Yoruba:Ti m ba je koko arugboIf I ate the the old woman’s cocoyamKi okun gbe mi, ki okun la miLet the sea take meKi okun gbe mi si erigidi ofun let the sea take me the first two brothers walk confidently across the river singing the song but the youngest brother was so scared as he walked and sang  he step faltered several time and he eventually fell into the river ​</a>

                                            ME GORGON'S HEAD Anne Terry White Acrisius, King of Argos, came home from Delphi with a heavy heart, for he had received a dreadful oracle that he will not have a son but a grandson who in the future will be the cause of his death. Frightened and to evade from his fate, King Acrisius hid Danae, his only daughter from the sight of men and locked her up inside a house of bronze sunk underground. But part of the roof of the house was open to the sky and Zeus saw lovely Danae and he stormed into the chamber in the form of a shower of gold. He appeared in front of Danae and in an instant Danae conceived a baby. Days after, Danae gave birth to a baby boy named Perseus. She kept her baby a secret from her father, but days have come, and King Acrisius learned about the secret. He built a great chest and placed Danae and her child in it and set them adrift upon the sea. All days and all nights the chest tossed upon the waves until it reached the Island of Seraphos where a fisherman named Dictys, saw the chest and took it, he opened it, and saw Danae and her child. When he beheld the pitiful mother with the helpless little child, his heart was moved. He took them both to his wife, for Dictys was childless and there in the kindly fisherfolk's humble home Perseus grew up. Polydectes, Dictys brother was captivated by Danae's beauty and made her his wife. King Plydectes got jealous over the love of Danae to Perseus and sought some ways to get rid of him. Polydectes sent Perseus to a dangerous adventure that put his life in peril. The adventure was to kill Medusa, one of the three Gorgons, who has a venomous snaky-haired and metal-scaled skin. Looking straight in the eye of Medusa can turn mortals into stone. Despite the dangers, he is facing, Perseus set off to find Medusa and agreed to fulfill his mission just to get his own name of glory. Hermes gave him a sword and Athena gave him a shield. Perseus was also told by Hermes to have the three essential things, the winged sandals, the magic wallet, and the helmet of invisibility which are all in the possession of the Nymphs of the North and to get there, Perseus has to go first to the Gray Women. He snatched the eye of the women and threatened not to return it unless they gave him the direction going to the Nymphs of the North. the reason why she was chained on the cliff. It was a revenge for her mother because her mother boasted that she is most beautiful than 50 lovely daughters of Nereus. Andromeda suffered the punishment and at any time the serpent will devour her. Perseus told Andromeda's parents that he would save their daughter with the condition that he would marry her. The king and queen agreed and Andromeda was saved from death. He brought Andromeda to his homeland, which at that time, games were being held at Larissa, Perseus upon hearing take part in the discus throw competition and when it was his turn to throw the discus, he threw and accidentally hit and killed an old man in the crowd. The old man was King Acrisius, his grandfather. Fully equipped and with the direction given, Perseus headed to the fearful island of the Gorgons. As he approached, he could see scattered in the fields, along the roads, statues of men and beasts whom the sight of Gorgons had turned into stone. For him to identify who is Medusa among the three, he was instructed by Athena that Medusa was the one closest to the shore. Perseus beheaded Medusa with one swift of his sword and with the help of his shield as mirror. He put Medusa's head inside a magic wallet. On his way home, Perseus noticed a beautiful maiden fastened by chains to a cliff by the sea. He asked the maiden's name and why she was hanged. The woman answered that she was Andromeda, the daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassipoeia. Andromeda told Perseus that her mother is ACTIVITY 3 Directions: Compare &amp; contrast the characters from the story by making a venn diagram. Choose only two characters. Use ½ manila paper.

                            4. The Three Brothers and the Pot of PorridgeThree brothers were traveling through the dense rain forest jungle. They had been traveling on foot for almost a full day and night was falling. They needed a suitable place to rest for the night, a place where they would be safe from prowling animals of the night.They were in luck because before darkness fell, they spotted a little isolated hut in the distance. When they arrived at the hut, they met a kindly old woman who invited them in and offered them a place to spend the night.The old woman offered them some porridge which she was cooking in an iron pot over some firewood. The brothers declined for they were very exhausted and also did not want to impose on this old woman who living alone, had cooked enough porridge only for one person.The old woman gave them some mats and showed them into a room where they could lay down and have a good night’s rest. Soon, the entire hut was dark and everyone in it was asleep.Sometime in the night, the youngest of the three brothers woke up and he was very hungry. His older brothers had declined the offer of some supper and he had just gone along, but he was really hungry. So he went out into the kitchen to see if any of the porridge remained and indeed, there was enough porridge in there for one person. It appeared that the old woman had not eaten any of it, she must have been keeping it for the next day. It wouldn’t harm anybody if he ate just a little bit of it, and it would certainly do him a lot of good. So he ate a little bit. Then a little bit more, and even more until it was all gone. Realizing his folly, he decided to cover it up and went out to pick some stones to put in the pot. He hoped the old woman would not notice.The three brothers were up early the next morning to continue on their journey. They bade farewell to the old woman and thanked her for her kindness.The old woman discovered the stones in her pot soon after the brothers left and immediately set out after them. Even though she was very old, she could move as fast, or maybe even faster than any young man since she was able to catch up with the three young men.She accused them of stealing her porridge and filling her pot with stones, at which the eldest brother who spoke for them sincerely denied. The old woman though was certain that one of them performed the deed, so she challenged them to take a test. They went to a nearby river which had a log laying across it. Each one of them would walk across the river on the log while singing a song which the woman taught to them. They would each sing this song in Yoruba:Ti m ba je koko arugboIf I ate the the old woman’s cocoyamKi okun gbe mi, ki okun la miLet the sea take meKi okun gbe mi si erigidi ofunLet the sea take me The first two brothers walked confidently across the river singing the song. But the youngest brother was so scared as he walked and sang. His step faltered several times and he eventually fell into the riverevent 1: event 2:event 3:event 4:​</h2><br />

STORY:
THE ‘SINGA’ 
Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and
wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart.
Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving
the king a shock...but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only
grazing the animal. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag
up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand- an island. Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him.
“What is the name of that island?” The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.”
“Then we are going there.” The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship
carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning. However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his
grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his
crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown
immediately and threw it into the sea. All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear
and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and
the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and
moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red
body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden
eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle.
“What sort of animal was that?”, the king asked. A wise old man stepped forth.
I have seen animals in portraits from the Far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.”
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live
here...here in the island of Singapura.”</h2><br />

                            7. The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</h2><br />

 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

                            10. The Three Brothers and the Pot of PorridgeThree brothers were traveling through the dense rain forest jungle. They had been traveling on foot for almost a full day and night was falling. They needed a suitable place to rest for the night, a place where they would be safe from prowling animals of the night.They were in luck because before darkness fell, they spotted a little isolated hut in the distance. When they arrived at the hut, they met a kindly old woman who invited them in and offered them a place to spend the night.The old woman offered them some porridge which she was cooking in an iron pot over some firewood. The brothers declined for they were very exhausted and also did not want to impose on this old woman who living alone, had cooked enough porridge only for one person.The old woman gave them some mats and showed them into a room where they could lay down and have a good night’s rest. Soon, the entire hut was dark and everyone in it was asleep.Sometime in the night, the youngest of the three brothers woke up and he was very hungry. His older brothers had declined the offer of some supper and he had just gone along, but he was really hungry. So he went out into the kitchen to see if any of the porridge remained and indeed, there was enough porridge in there for one person. It appeared that the old woman had not eaten any of it, she must have been keeping it for the next day. It wouldn’t harm anybody if he ate just a little bit of it, and it would certainly do him a lot of good. So he ate a little bit. Then a little bit more, and even more until it was all gone. Realizing his folly, he decided to cover it up and went out to pick some stones to put in the pot. He hoped the old woman would not notice.The three brothers were up early the next morning to continue on their journey. They bade farewell to the old woman and thanked her for her kindness.The old woman discovered the stones in her pot soon after the brothers left and immediately set out after them. Even though she was very old, she could move as fast, or maybe even faster than any young man since she was able to catch up with the three young men.She accused them of stealing her porridge and filling her pot with stones, at which the eldest brother who spoke for them sincerely denied. The old woman though was certain that one of them performed the deed, so she challenged them to take a test. They went to a nearby river which had a log laying across it. Each one of them would walk across the river on the log while singing a song which the woman taught to them. They would each sing this song in Yoruba:Ti m ba je koko arugboIf I ate the the old woman’s cocoyamKi okun gbe mi, ki okun la miLet the sea take meKi okun gbe mi si erigidi ofun let the sea take me the first two brothers walk confidently across the river singing the song but the youngest brother was so scared as he walked and sang  he step faltered several time and he eventually fell into the river ​</h2><br />

                            11. ME GORGON'S HEAD Anne Terry White Acrisius, King of Argos, came home from Delphi with a heavy heart, for he had received a dreadful oracle that he will not have a son but a grandson who in the future will be the cause of his death. Frightened and to evade from his fate, King Acrisius hid Danae, his only daughter from the sight of men and locked her up inside a house of bronze sunk underground. But part of the roof of the house was open to the sky and Zeus saw lovely Danae and he stormed into the chamber in the form of a shower of gold. He appeared in front of Danae and in an instant Danae conceived a baby. Days after, Danae gave birth to a baby boy named Perseus. She kept her baby a secret from her father, but days have come, and King Acrisius learned about the secret. He built a great chest and placed Danae and her child in it and set them adrift upon the sea. All days and all nights the chest tossed upon the waves until it reached the Island of Seraphos where a fisherman named Dictys, saw the chest and took it, he opened it, and saw Danae and her child. When he beheld the pitiful mother with the helpless little child, his heart was moved. He took them both to his wife, for Dictys was childless and there in the kindly fisherfolk's humble home Perseus grew up. Polydectes, Dictys brother was captivated by Danae's beauty and made her his wife. King Plydectes got jealous over the love of Danae to Perseus and sought some ways to get rid of him. Polydectes sent Perseus to a dangerous adventure that put his life in peril. The adventure was to kill Medusa, one of the three Gorgons, who has a venomous snaky-haired and metal-scaled skin. Looking straight in the eye of Medusa can turn mortals into stone. Despite the dangers, he is facing, Perseus set off to find Medusa and agreed to fulfill his mission just to get his own name of glory. Hermes gave him a sword and Athena gave him a shield. Perseus was also told by Hermes to have the three essential things, the winged sandals, the magic wallet, and the helmet of invisibility which are all in the possession of the Nymphs of the North and to get there, Perseus has to go first to the Gray Women. He snatched the eye of the women and threatened not to return it unless they gave him the direction going to the Nymphs of the North. the reason why she was chained on the cliff. It was a revenge for her mother because her mother boasted that she is most beautiful than 50 lovely daughters of Nereus. Andromeda suffered the punishment and at any time the serpent will devour her. Perseus told Andromeda's parents that he would save their daughter with the condition that he would marry her. The king and queen agreed and Andromeda was saved from death. He brought Andromeda to his homeland, which at that time, games were being held at Larissa, Perseus upon hearing take part in the discus throw competition and when it was his turn to throw the discus, he threw and accidentally hit and killed an old man in the crowd. The old man was King Acrisius, his grandfather. Fully equipped and with the direction given, Perseus headed to the fearful island of the Gorgons. As he approached, he could see scattered in the fields, along the roads, statues of men and beasts whom the sight of Gorgons had turned into stone. For him to identify who is Medusa among the three, he was instructed by Athena that Medusa was the one closest to the shore. Perseus beheaded Medusa with one swift of his sword and with the help of his shield as mirror. He put Medusa's head inside a magic wallet. On his way home, Perseus noticed a beautiful maiden fastened by chains to a cliff by the sea. He asked the maiden's name and why she was hanged. The woman answered that she was Andromeda, the daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassipoeia. Andromeda told Perseus that her mother is ACTIVITY 3 Directions: Compare &amp; contrast the characters from the story by making a venn diagram. Choose only two characters. Use ½ manila paper.
