On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</a>

He even researches on how to improve their new business. There are good days, there are also not so good times. But he promised his family that he will continue to strive. He hopes that one day, after all that has happened in their lives, he looks forward to make his shop bigger and better, and become an inspiration to other people. Guide  Questions: 1. How does the pandemic affect the family of Roberto? 2. Was he able to solve his problem? How? 3. What are the qualities he has to achieve his own business? (Give at least 3) 4. Do you think he will be able to achieve his dream of becoming an inspiration to other people? Why?​</a>

He even researches on how to improve their new business. There are good days, there are also not so good times. But he promised his family that he will continue to strive.
