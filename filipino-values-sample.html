                                            STORY:Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates Grandparent's Day today, it is an appropriate time for young Filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents. No two families are alike, but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. Make today a special day for Grandma and Grandpa. Grandparent's Day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life. HAPPY CRANDPARENTS DAY QUESTION:Activity 2: Answer Me! Direction: Go back to the editorial sample.

Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it I perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. in urban areas today,grandparents form a vital part of the primary caregiving network.they are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home,especially so when one or both parents work abroad.Grandparents who aremore affluent enjoy spoiling their grandchildren,giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit.

                            8. STORY:Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates Grandparent's Day today, it is an appropriate time for young Filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents. No two families are alike, but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. Make today a special day for Grandma and Grandpa. Grandparent's Day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life. HAPPY CRANDPARENTS DAY QUESTION:Activity 2: Answer Me! Direction: Go back to the editorial sample.

                        <strong>To create the probability distribution</strong>, we need to calculate the proportion of school children in the sample who can hold an everyday conversation in each of the possible numbers of languages. We can calculate the proportion by dividing the frequency of each value by the total sample size, which is 1000.<p></p><p>  2. The probability that a randomly selected Filipino child has 4 languages spoken is 0.066 or 6.6%. This is because the probability of a child speaking 4 languages is equal to the proportion of the sample who speak 4 languages, which is 0.066<strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p>   3. The probability that a randomly selected Filipino child has three or less than three languages spoken can be calculated by adding up the proportions of children who speak 1, 2, or 3 languages.</p><p></p><p>Probability of 1, 2, or 3 languages spoken = 0.663 + 0.226 + 0.005 = 0.894</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected Filipino child has three or less than three languages spoken is <strong>0.894 or 89.4%.</strong></p><br />
