(20 points) 1. “Women entrepreneurs in the developing world often face challenges that limit their chances for success and growth. They often have less access to education than men and have difficulty getting financing on their own. But with an understanding of the essential aspects of doing business – such as planning, financing, networking and marketing – they can overcome those obstacles. That's where the 10,000 Women Initiative comes in. As Faiza Elmasry tells us, it's an investment in education with dividends that benefit the businesswomen, their local communities and their national economies.” Paraphrasing the text:​</a>

________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.

                                            'Ligtas na balik-paaralan': Groups, education stakeholders call for safe school reopening
Published September 7, 2021
by Gabriela Baron
Various groups and education stakeholders on Tuesday, Sept. 7, issued a five-point demand to the national government as another school year starts under the imposition of distance learning.
“The President has rejected at least three times the proposals to reopen schools in areas considered to be at low-risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, without providing a clear roadmap on how and when it plans to do so,” the groups said in a statement.
The groups hit Duterte’s failure to provide the requisites for the safe delivery of accessible quality of education amid the pandemic.
“Millions of youth and education workers will be again subjected to under-supported and onerous distance learning amidst the ranging pandemic and worsening economic crisis,” they added.
According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Philippines is one of the five countries in the world that have not started in-person classes since the pandemic began.
School closures have affected over 27 million students.
The Duterte administration is urged to roll out a clear plan for the immediate safe conduct of limited and voluntary in-classroom learning in low-risk areas; provide the needed teaching and learning resources for distance learning; ensure the provision of health protection and payment of just benefits to education workers; allocate higher budget to education in 2022; and implement genuine academic ease.
The groups also urged to ramp up the vaccination of teacher and education support personnel and grant P1,500 monthly Internet allowance to teachers and Internet subsidy to learners in need.
The unity statement is signed by the National Union of Students of the Philippines, NNARA-Youth, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Amihan, Gabriela-Marikina, Salinlahi, Kabataan, and Kabataan Partylist.

________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.

                            21. 'Ligtas na balik-paaralan': Groups, education stakeholders call for safe school reopening
Published September 7, 2021
by Gabriela Baron
Various groups and education stakeholders on Tuesday, Sept. 7, issued a five-point demand to the national government as another school year starts under the imposition of distance learning.
“The President has rejected at least three times the proposals to reopen schools in areas considered to be at low-risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, without providing a clear roadmap on how and when it plans to do so,” the groups said in a statement.
The groups hit Duterte’s failure to provide the requisites for the safe delivery of accessible quality of education amid the pandemic.
“Millions of youth and education workers will be again subjected to under-supported and onerous distance learning amidst the ranging pandemic and worsening economic crisis,” they added.
According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Philippines is one of the five countries in the world that have not started in-person classes since the pandemic began.
School closures have affected over 27 million students.
The Duterte administration is urged to roll out a clear plan for the immediate safe conduct of limited and voluntary in-classroom learning in low-risk areas; provide the needed teaching and learning resources for distance learning; ensure the provision of health protection and payment of just benefits to education workers; allocate higher budget to education in 2022; and implement genuine academic ease.
The groups also urged to ramp up the vaccination of teacher and education support personnel and grant P1,500 monthly Internet allowance to teachers and Internet subsidy to learners in need.
The unity statement is signed by the National Union of Students of the Philippines, NNARA-Youth, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Amihan, Gabriela-Marikina, Salinlahi, Kabataan, and Kabataan Partylist.
