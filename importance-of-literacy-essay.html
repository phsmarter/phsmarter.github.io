A literature review was conducted to identify the current themes, patterns, correlations and gaps within the existing literature on fake news, information literacy and librarianship. Findings centre on defining fake news, analysing contemporary and emerging information literacy frameworks, and outlining the current efforts and initiatives exercised by libraries to refute the spread of fake news and educate communities on how to navigate through an era of untruth and disinformation. The paper outlines effective initiatives developed by those within the Library and Information Systems (LIS) profession while highlighting considerations and recommendations as to how librarians can continue to enhance their role in the digital age and make successful contributions to the professional field.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po thank you :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being “literate” in media use is in basic terms how much a person truly understands about the chosen form of media they most use. If you understand that news organizations do what’s called “agenda-setting” you know that the gatekeepers of those information outlets (whether in print or online) decide what kind of messages will be delivered even up to and including how the messages are structured. If you believe them to be impartial and don’t understand the context, you are not fully media literate.
</p><p>
</p><p>Information literacy is based on content analysis. How much of what the writer is trying to say do you understand? Think about all those tests you took as a kid for scores on “reading comprehension.” If you are very literate in your ability to analyze the meaning behind the information you receive you would possess a high degree of comprehension. In that case, distinguish between what is true and what is propaganda (as an example).
</p><p>
</p><p>Information technology is how information is managed using machine knowledge, algorithms, and software platforms that compute the information in manageable bits and bytes. It also includes the server technology and architecture infrastructure that allows different programs to communicate with each other even though some code may be wildly different across a platform. It isn’t related to communication theory in any way because it requires intervention by a third source and is generally seen as a mathematical construct.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The word ‘literacy’ means an ability to read and write. In a civilized country, every citizen should learn how to read and write. If not, he is called an illiterate person. An illiterate person has to face many practical difficulties in life.</p><p></p><p>As he is unable to read or write, he cannot read a letter addressed to him by his near and dear ones. He cannot calculate his own income and expenses, nor can keep his own accounts. Morally and psychologically, he feels insecure and weak, and hence suffers from an inferiority complex.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, every person in the society should try to become literate. If it was not possible in an early age, a grown-up man can yet learn how to read and write in his advanced stage of life. Literacy will help him also in gaining common knowledge in various subjects, which will make him a “complete man.</p><p></p><p>An illiterate man is generally exploited by the clever men in the society.

                        <p> </p><p>Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. The lack of these skills is called financial illiteracy.Financial literacy is a serious matter in this Digital Age. It shouldn’t just be taught in school but should also be taught at home, even for young kids.</p><p></p><p>It is an awareness of how money should be spent and managed, and how it can be used in ways that would make a person more financially secure in the future. Learning about it has a huge impact to us all.</p><p></p><p>First, it helps us understand the value of money so we can handle our finances better.</p><p>Being financially literate will teach us the importance of budgeting and saving. We won’t just waste our money for very expensive gadgets, clothes, cars, bags, shoes and other things which we don’t really need. We can better understand between our wants and needs and can prioritize things according to their essence in our daily lives.</p><p></p><p>Second, it saves us from acquiring too much debt. Acquiring too much debt can put us in deep trouble.  If we are financially literate, we can determine how much loan we can afford to pay, especially if we have bills for mortgages and insurances. This will also train us to prepare for our children’s education and their future needs, as well as for medical and hospital bills, without having to lend money.</p><p></p><p>Third, it allows us to impart our knowledge on financial literacy to the young generation.</p><p>To be financially literate will help us secure the future of the next generation. We can teach them how to budget and save to prepare for years ahead. They can also realize even at their young age how their parents work hard to provide for all their needs. Helping them become aware of the importance of financial literacy will likewise teach them discipline and respect for their parents. This will also train them to understand that eventually, they should be financially independent. They will be more responsible and street-smart.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, financial literacy helps us prepare better during times of emergency.</p><p>We encounter moments of emergency wherein we need cash or a huge amount of money to survive or overcome our monetary and emotional crises. In times like this, being financially literate will save us the trouble of borrowing money that will just bring us more problems.</p><p></p><p>Fifth, it enlightens us to invest and create income streams.Investing in stocks and creating income streams besides our salaries are results of financial literacy. Relying on just one source of income will keep us in a situation where we always make both ends meet. Creating multiple income streams will give us the confidence that we can survive financial crises.</p><p></p><p>Sixth, it gives us the opportunity to help boost our country’s economy. When we invest a percentage of our money, say, in stocks, we help the company we invest in to create more jobs. This means better employment rate and better contribution to help build a more progressive nation.</p><p></p><p>Seventh, financial literacy gives us the privilege to help the less fortunate.</p><p>It provides us the opportunity to share our blessings to the needy. This is because we are able to spend our money more wisely and we get to save a percentage of it for investment, business, retirement, to name a few. We can then provide a certain amount too of our savings to those who are in dire need of help.  Helping others give us a sense of fulfillment that is definitely priceless.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                            27. Essay about what is 
literacy</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Literacy is the process of learning whereby an individual gains the ability to understand and convey written information, gain new skills from the information, teach those skills and apply the acquired knowledge and skills for the benefit of the society. Here the key words are gain, ability to understand, teach, apply, and for a benefit. However, different people have defined literacy differently in different periods. Traditionally, people defined literacy as the ability to read, appropriately use written information and appropriately write in a range of contexts (Winch, 2007, p. 20). However, there have been new aspects arising from the definition.This definition does not involve critical thinking in the application of the information retrieved from the written sources. It remains insufficient since it does not account for several aspects that are significant as far as literacy is concerned.Most people perceive that literacy comprises of a set of several tangible skills, which include the cognitive skills of reading and writing. These skills ought to be independent of the context of acquiring them and the background of the individual who acquires them (Adams, 1993, p. 24). The individual should be able to decode phonetics, spelling, word recognition and vocabulary. This implies that one should not depend on pictures to denote meaning. There is emphasis on both the ability to understand orally given information and the ability to present it as written literature An addition to the contemporary definitions of literacy is that it should be a learning process in which, individuals continually acquire knowledge and skills and use those skills for the benefit of the society (Rogoff, 2003, p. 6). According to National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy, learning to read and the teaching of reading is usually included within the broader area of literacy (2005, p. 7). Therefore, the literacy learning system should focus on strategies that are investigative, reflective, tailored, tested, embedded, purposively practiced and shared</p><p>In conclusion, literacy includes gaining knowledge, being able to understand, to teach, to apply, and to use for a specific benefit. These aspects are equally important and therefore absence of either may translate to illiteracy. For this reason, when assessing literacy level, it is important to consider all the aspects. It applies in all fields.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

When you have the ability to grasp a concept or have studied a subject, you would be considered literate because you “get it.”</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In my opinion, information literacy is the comprehension of ideas and messages that are shared in whatever form they take — verbal, nonverbal, digital or analog. When you have the ability to grasp a concept or have studied a subject, you would be considered literate because you “get it.”In technology, it’s a pretty similar process. On the surface, you either grasp the value of any given technological advancement and it’s benefits, or you don’t. If you are talking about anything specific about technology, say, that computers are networked, our phones work from wireless connections, or that the term “in the cloud” means electronic files stored on servers, etc. you would be considerably literate in your knowledge without being a developer or technologist.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In my opinion, information literacy is the comprehension of ideas and messages that are shared in whatever form they take — verbal, nonverbal, digital or analog.

I’m literate enough to understand how cars operate, but I’m not a mechanic.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In my opinion, information literacy is the comprehension of ideas and messages that are shared in whatever form they take — verbal, nonverbal, digital or analog.

I’m literate enough to understand how cars operate, but I’m not a mechanic.I’ve seen a person who never experienced a motion detection system in bathroom faucets, and not understand how the water comes out. That would be a condition where you may consider that they are not literate in how something operates.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
