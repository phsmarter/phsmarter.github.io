                                            DAY 2LESSON PROPER:Textual aids refer to non-textual elements that help readersunderstand the content of the text. They also refer to elements thatstand- out from the main text such as titles and subtitles, bold,italicized and underlined texts. Non-textual elements includeillustrations, maps, tables, graphs and charts.These aids have two main functions, namely: first, to direct the readers"attention to important ideas in the text and second, to provide moreinformation as a supplement to what is already written.1. Titles and subtitles provide initial idea on what the text is all about, thusactivating what the readers already know about the topic. According to EliteEditing (2015), these aids "represent the key concepts (title) and supportingideas (subtitles) in the paper". The layering or positioning of these aidsconvey the ideas" level ofimportance and their prominent text formatdistinguish the idea that they contain from the rest of the text.Here is an interactive example so that you will understand betterhow titles and subtitles work as textual aids.NOTE TO LEARNERS: notice how the titles and subtitlespresented below and think of the answers to the questions thatfollow. Discussion of the answers follows after the example.1. What do you notice with these textual aids? How do theylook like?2. Between Title 1 and Title 2, which do you think is theoverall title of the article? Why do you say so?3. From all the titles, which are the key concepts and whichare the supporting details? Why do you say so?4. Based on how the sample is presented, do you think thepositioning of these titles is correct and appropriate? Whydo you say so?5. Given the titles and subtitles, what do you think is thearticle about? What do you already know about it?​</a>

                                            WHAT I KNOW Directions: Write T if the statement is TRUE and F if it's FALSE. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 1. The argumentative essay is a genre of writing that requires the writer to investigate a topic, collect, generate, and evaluate evidence; and establish a position on the topic in a concise manner. 2. Argumentative essays should have a straightforward structure so they are easy for readers to follow. 3. The goal of an argumentative essay is to entertain the readers and forget their problems in life. 4. A good argumentative essay should have the power to convince the readers to believe and accept the arguments presented by the writer in his essay. 5. The body paragraphs of the essay should outline the topic, provide background information necessary to understand the argument, outline the evidence the writer will present and state the thesis. 6. The thesis statement is part of the introductory paragraph. It is a concise, one-sentence summary of the main point and claim. 7. Introductory paragraph restates the thesis statement and summarizes all of the arguments made in the body paragraphs. 8. Body paragraphs are where the writer backs up his/her claims with examples, research, statistics, studies, and text citations. 9. Your thesis statement is only one sentence long, but it's the most important part of your argumentative essay. 10. Writing an argumentative essay takes time and often involves outlining the main points.​</a>

                                            What is it? Activity 12: Read the sample position paper. Then answer the questions that follow. Committee: General Assembly Topic: Global Warming Country: The Kingdom of Sweden Delegates: ***************** Global warming's effects and influence on the global climate is visible all around us now. As time has passed in the past century, Arctic ice has begun to gradually melt and sea levels have started to rise. If this situation continues, then low-lying island nations such as Vanuatu and Maldives will sink into the sea and will simply disappear. Also, climate is changing in many parts of the world because of global warming. For example, acid rain damaging soils and forests, particularly in our country, serious droughts in Australia, and abnormal weather patterns all over the world. These things are not naturally occurring phenomena - they were caused by human actions. Our nation is addressing global warming on a domestic level. For example, we are separating household waste and recycling as much as we can, and are imposing taxes on CO2 emissions. Out carbon dioxide emissions are 0.4% of the global total. We are raising public awareness of the environmental problems they will face in the future, and we hope that our people will address this issue. But individual nations cannot succeed - the only way to secure our future is if we can get a consensus of nations to take action to reduce these effects. Humans caused this problem and ultimately they must address and deal with it. We must, as global citizens, address this problem actively.

                            5. DAY 2LESSON PROPER:Textual aids refer to non-textual elements that help readersunderstand the content of the text. They also refer to elements thatstand- out from the main text such as titles and subtitles, bold,italicized and underlined texts. Non-textual elements includeillustrations, maps, tables, graphs and charts.These aids have two main functions, namely: first, to direct the readers"attention to important ideas in the text and second, to provide moreinformation as a supplement to what is already written.1. Titles and subtitles provide initial idea on what the text is all about, thusactivating what the readers already know about the topic. According to EliteEditing (2015), these aids "represent the key concepts (title) and supportingideas (subtitles) in the paper". The layering or positioning of these aidsconvey the ideas" level ofimportance and their prominent text formatdistinguish the idea that they contain from the rest of the text.Here is an interactive example so that you will understand betterhow titles and subtitles work as textual aids.NOTE TO LEARNERS: notice how the titles and subtitlespresented below and think of the answers to the questions thatfollow. Discussion of the answers follows after the example.1. What do you notice with these textual aids? How do theylook like?2. Between Title 1 and Title 2, which do you think is theoverall title of the article? Why do you say so?3. From all the titles, which are the key concepts and whichare the supporting details? Why do you say so?4. Based on how the sample is presented, do you think thepositioning of these titles is correct and appropriate? Whydo you say so?5. Given the titles and subtitles, what do you think is thearticle about? What do you already know about it?​</h2><br />

                            9. What is it? Activity 12: Read the sample position paper. Then answer the questions that follow. Committee: General Assembly Topic: Global Warming Country: The Kingdom of Sweden Delegates: ***************** Global warming's effects and influence on the global climate is visible all around us now. As time has passed in the past century, Arctic ice has begun to gradually melt and sea levels have started to rise. If this situation continues, then low-lying island nations such as Vanuatu and Maldives will sink into the sea and will simply disappear. Also, climate is changing in many parts of the world because of global warming. For example, acid rain damaging soils and forests, particularly in our country, serious droughts in Australia, and abnormal weather patterns all over the world. These things are not naturally occurring phenomena - they were caused by human actions. Our nation is addressing global warming on a domestic level. For example, we are separating household waste and recycling as much as we can, and are imposing taxes on CO2 emissions. Out carbon dioxide emissions are 0.4% of the global total. We are raising public awareness of the environmental problems they will face in the future, and we hope that our people will address this issue. But individual nations cannot succeed - the only way to secure our future is if we can get a consensus of nations to take action to reduce these effects. Humans caused this problem and ultimately they must address and deal with it. We must, as global citizens, address this problem actively.
