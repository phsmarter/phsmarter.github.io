When you woke up this morning, did you think today would be the day you save a life? In fact, it's quite easy to save a life and it only takes a little bit of your time. You don't even need to be a paramedic or firefighter. All you have to do is set aside approximately one hour to donate blood. This essay will explore how to donate blood, whom it benefits, and how often you can contribute to these life-saving measures. Sample Conclusion #1: This concludes the essay example above on the topic of donating blood. Note how it emphasizes the simplicity of the process. The process of donating blood is decidedly simple. Many folks carry out the process while reading a chapter from a new book or watching an episode of their favorite TV show. Indeed, the infinitesimal amount of time it takes to donate blood can transfer into a lifetime of happiness for the recipient. Remember to bring juice or something sugary to keep your glucose levels high at the end of the procedure. Then, hold your head up high, knowing there's a life out there that's about to be saved by you. Questions: 1. How do you find the sample introduction? 2. How about the conclusion?please help me​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Earth and the resources of earth make life possible on it. If we were to imagine our lives without these resources, that would not be possible. As life cannot function without sunshine, air, vegetation, and water. However, this is soon going to be our reality if we do not save the earth now.</p><p>Essay on Save Earth</p><p>The resources earth provides us with are limited. They are blessings which we do not count. Human has become selfish and is utilizing the earth’s resources at a rapid rate. We need to protect them in order to protect our lives. This is so because man and all living organisms depend on the earth for their survival.</p><p>It is The Need of the Hour</p><p>To say that saving the earth is the need of the hour would be an understatement. All the activities of humans driven by greed and selfishness have caused immense damage to the earth. It is degraded it beyond repair. Almost all the natural resources are now polluted due to these activities.</p><p>When all these resources will be under threat, naturally lives of all living organisms will be under peril. This is why we need to save the earth at all costs. All the other issues are secondary and saving the earth is the main concern. For when the earth will not remain, the other issues will go away automatically.</p><p>Earth is the only planet which can sustain life on it. We do not have a planet B which we can move onto. This makes it all the more serious to save the earth and save our lives.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Title: The Importance of Studying Astronomical Phenomena Before the Advent of Telescope</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Before the advent of the telescope, people already observed and recorded different astronomical phenomena. These observations helped them understand the world around them and laid the foundation for modern astronomy. One example of such phenomena is the movement of the stars.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>People have been observing the movement of the stars for thousands of years. They noticed that stars appeared to move across the sky throughout the night, and that some stars were always visible, while others were not. They also observed that stars appeared to move in patterns, known as constellations. These observations led to the development of calendars, which were used to track the seasons and predict the best time for planting and harvesting crops.</p><p></p><p>The study of astronomical phenomena also played a significant role in navigation. Early sailors used the position of the stars to navigate the seas, and they developed sophisticated methods for measuring the position of the stars and predicting their movements.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the study of astronomical phenomena before the advent of the telescope helped people develop a sense of wonder and awe about the universe. They marveled at the beauty of the night sky and the mysteries of the cosmos. This sense of wonder and curiosity continues to inspire people today, as we explore the universe through modern technology.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, the study of astronomical phenomena before the advent of the telescope was essential in laying the foundation for modern astronomy and in understanding the world around us. The movement of the stars, in particular, was crucial in the development of calendars, navigation, and inspiring a sense of wonder and curiosity about the universe. Even today, the study of astronomical phenomena remains relevant and fascinating, as we continue to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yan na po yong sagot nya okay napo</p><br />

                        <p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Life is something that requires a considerable amount of physical and mental effort. Some are fortunate enough to have everything prepared for them.  Such as some are born into money; some come across good fortune yet most work hard from the start to get some where in the world. It just all depends on how you were brought into this world. For some people, life is full of stress and hardships. That’s how life was for someone very dear to me. He had it difficult from the start. However he chose not to let life get him down. When life gave him lemons, he made lemonade. From the day that high school started, he had to work to support his seven siblings and his mother. Along with his father he worked hard to support his family.</p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>sana </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>maka </strong><strong>tolung:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p></p><p>Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights, focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems. Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.[3] Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have the obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights.[4] Human rights cannot be separated from the societal contexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, which include the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancing their ability to participate as active members of society.[5] Such an understanding of social rights calls our attention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the “collective.”[6] Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rights is not optional.[7] In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respect and protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic and social rights for all.</p><br />

                        <p>Short Essay <strong>My Life in Pandemic</strong></p><p>COVID-19 has a cost. Many lost jobs, homes, and lives due to this pandemic. The infection affected my mood. For three months, I was scared and annoyed by how this virus was treated. I thought this virus might infect my family. I was told to practice personal hygiene and social distancing each time I brought it up. During the summer, I worked on my mental health. Before I got home from school, I was anxious. I wanted to eliminate my panic after realizing how anxious I was.</p><p>So I did group therapy. I attended a few programs. They all focused on anxiety and how to deal with it. Three months ago, I created a new connection with my anxiety. This tool helped me spot early indicators of a panic attack. Our group therapist offered us techniques to use when anxious. I am grateful for the result because I was patient with myself and did my homework to practice imageries and ten connected breaths. There are other ways to combat panic attacks, but they worked for me.</p><p>Being home all summer made me work out more. During my first year, I scarcely exercised, damaging my mood. I stay healthy and positive by exercising regularly. Besides being happier, I was in better shape. The Pandemic put me in lockup for a month.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Hello everyone, my name is [insert name], and I am excited to talk to you today about the importance of friendship in our lives. As the famous quote goes, "Life is better with friends," and I couldn't agree more. We all need friends in our lives, whether it's to share our joys or to lean on during tough times. Today, I will share some insights on why friendships are important and how they can enhance our lives.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, friendships provide us with a sense of belonging. As human beings, we all have an innate need to feel connected to others, and friends fulfill that need by accepting us for who we are. They provide a safe space where we can be ourselves without fear of judgment. Moreover, studies have shown that people with strong social connections are generally happier and healthier than those who lack social support.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, friendships provide us with emotional support. Life can be challenging, and we all face difficult times at some point. Having friends who we can talk to, confide in, and seek advice from can help us navigate these tough times. Friends offer a listening ear, empathy, and a shoulder to cry on. They can provide us with the encouragement and motivation we need to keep going.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, friendships provide us with fun and laughter. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and having friends to share experiences with can make life more enjoyable. Whether it's going to the movies, trying out new restaurants, or simply hanging out at home, friends can make ordinary moments extraordinary. Laughter is also contagious, and friends can lift our moods and brighten up our days.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, friendships are essential for our emotional, mental, and physical well-being. They provide us with a sense of belonging, emotional support, and fun and laughter. So, I encourage you to cherish the friendships in your life and make an effort to nurture them. Remember, life is better with friends.</p><p></p><p>Advice:</p><p></p><p>If you are struggling to make friends, try joining groups or clubs that align with your interests. This will give you the opportunity to meet like-minded people and build relationships based on shared passions. Also, be open to making new friends, even if they don't fit the mold of your ideal friend. Sometimes, the most unlikely friendships can be the most fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>Question:</p><p></p><p>What are some ways you can show appreciation for your friends and strengthen your friendships?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A Time When Technology Made My Life More Difficult</p><p>The way we live today is significantly different from the way our forefathers lived fiftyor sixty years ago. Thanks to all the technology we have these days, we got just about everyamenities we need to live a comfortable life. What is technology? According to OxfordDictionary (2018), technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes,especially in industry. By using technology, we can accomplish various tasks in our daily lives.Technology can also be described as products and processes used to simplify our daily lives.Indeed, we use technology to extend our abilities and make people the most crucial part ofany technological system. However, it is vital to know if technology is well applied, it benefitshumans, but if we misused technology, it will be a double edged sword to humans.Without further ado, I would like to share about a time when technology made my lifemore difficult. I cannot deny that technology had always help me to solve many problems butsometimes it just complicates me. As a student, mobile phone is a technology that I oftenused. I bring mobile phone wherever I went to appropriate certain places such as in the class.Indeed, mobile phone benefits in education system. I usually use my mobile phone to organisemy schedule, share notes and connect with my family and friends. By using mobile phone tofind information is also much faster than using laptop and computer. However, it was a tougherlife for me as mobile phone had become my best friend before this. In fact, mobile phone wasa friend but it also a wolf who in sheep clothing.Based on my experience, mobile phone has made my life more complicated. However,can anybody now imagine of a world which does not have any access to mobile phone or anymodern technologies? The truth is we cannot. I agree that it is not easy to live without mobilephone as I used to enjoy it. As a student, mobile phone always affect to my studies and dailyplans. There are reasons for me to say those things. These days, mobile phone is alwaysavailable under my fingertips with the click of a button or a few taps on a glass screen. Withoutany second thought, I will start playing my favourite game within seconds or send a short textin the blink of an eye. Eventually, I stop doing homework or revision and start playing gamesand scrolling social media using the hush phone. Almost every day I will go to bed at one or two in the early morning. Why do I sleeplate? It was all about mobile phone. I realised that I should get some rest to recharge myenergy by having enough sleep. However, I did not know why every single day</p><br />

I grew up in a caring and nurturing home where I always felt safe and cherished from a young age. My parents always treated me as if I mattered. Throughout my life, I've been a tenacious young man, If things didn't go my way, I used to throw a tantrum. Despite the fact that my mother loved me unconditionally, I was a very demanding child. My mother was always understanding and patient with me, and she used to explain things to me in such a manner that I could understand why things didn't always work out the way I wanted them to. I never wanted to understand her preachings as a child, though. However, a trip to an orphanage on a school trip completely transformed my perspective on life.</p><p></p><p>The place where orphans (children who are homeless and have no parents) are cared for is known as an orphanage. Our school once arranged an educational trip to an orphanage institute when I was in fourth grade. We were instructed to bring whatever we wished to donate. My mum gave me some old toys, clothes, and sweets as a gift. We were able to gather a large amount of information for distribution.</p><p></p><p>All of the children gathered in a hall as we entered the institution. Children of all ages were present. They looked up at us with a hopeful look in their eyes. We were given the task of dispersing the items and spent some time with them. They were ecstatic when they received these old items. We learned from our conversations with them that they only have two or three dresses to choose from. For their food, they'll have a plate and a bowl. The food that was supplied to them was always the same and restricted in quantity. There aren't many meal options for them to choose from. They have the same set of toys to play with. These children have no idea what it is to be loved, cared for, or adored. They have no right to demand anything. I realized all of my mistakes after seeing how horrible every child's situation was. I realized how fortunate I am to be able to enjoy all of the luxuries.</p><p></p><p>When my parents criticized me for not studying correctly, making mistakes, or not listening to them, I didn't enjoy it because they were concerned about every word they uttered. They were there for me at every stage of my life, no matter how ill they were. But I felt so sorry for these children because they don't have the words to express their concern, rage, or affection. For me, going to the orphanage is a life-changing experience. I started to appreciate the little things in life from that day on. I've never been one to demand unexpected things. I feel compelled to assist everyone who is in need. As time went on, I began to grasp my mother's preachings, and, with her aid, I learned how to deal with my own emotions and situations, which formed my conduct and personality in the process. I consider myself exceedingly blessed to have parents who take care of me in every way possible. It is for this reason that I am really grateful.</p><p></p><p>===Ani===</p><p></p>#HopeItHelps^-^<br />
