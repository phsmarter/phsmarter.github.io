The goal of an argumentative essay is to entertain the readers and forget their problems in life. 4. A good argumentative essay should have the power to convince the readers to believe and accept the arguments presented by the writer in his essay. 5.

The thesis statement is part of the introductory paragraph. It is a concise, one-sentence summary of the main point and claim. 7. Introductory paragraph restates the thesis statement and summarizes all of the arguments made in the body paragraphs. 8. Body paragraphs are where the writer backs up his/her claims with examples, research, statistics, studies, and text citations. 9.

BAYANI
They are the heroes of the Philippines
Many years ago
He did it indefinitely
Such a good show
Lapu-lapu is the first hero
He defeated opponents fiercely
Wants to occupy and oppress
They failed and were defeated
Jose Rizal is the national hero
His brains used to be good
Help the people from being oppressed
In his hometown he was made a servant
Andres Bonifacio father of
KatipunanFought for freedom
Not afraid of foreigners
Not betrayed until death
Apolinario Mabini the great cripple
Handicapped but smart
In the rebellion he was a counselor
Even sick do not beat
Freedom is what we want to achieve
Until the world shrinks
And life became the substitute
In the hands of the cruel foreigner.</a>

                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

                                            health is wealth.there is nothing in our life that is more valuable than health. without health, there is no peace, no success and no happiness When we are ill, we do not want to work or play. Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.

Lyubomirsky (2005) cited eight happiness ideas that we can do to be happy. Do kind things. This does not only bring happiness to the people you helped, but also to you. Remember good things in your life. Revisit a happy childhood memory or recall a time you made someone happy. Be grateful by saying “thank you” to the people who helped you. Being grateful helps us have a healthy heart! Spend time with your loved ones. We get happy chemicals when we bond with our family and friends. Forgive those people who hurt you. This helps you relieve the stress and burden your heart brings! Take time to exercise. Our body needs physical movement for a good blood flow. See the good things around you. Notice the raindrops and the flowers bloom! Work with your problem and stress. Learn how to balance your studies and play time.</a>

</p><p>
</p><p>The 7 year old me going with Dad to a swimming pool. It was just him and I that went and so we arrived and settled down. Went down with Dad into the swimming pool and he aided me in swimming. Had a good swim, really enjoyed it, went out of the pool for a break and Dad had to go do something, asking me to remain in place and not to go anywhere. I was a good boy and I obeyed his instructions. However not this time, I had the urge to go back swimming again. Without my Dad's supervision, I entered the water slowly, submerged in the water, heads up, hands stretching out to the sides of the pool for support. So I started moving my hands, one by one, by the side of the pool, forth and back several times. I did so until I was confident (for no logical reason) that I am able to swim without any support, just by randomly flapping my arms and legs I'll do fine. I pushed away from the side of the pool completely unaware of the consequences (1.5 meters deep, no life vest, absolutely inexperienced in swimming). Randomly moving my limbs, vigorously, confident that I'll be able to keep my head above the surface; I did, for a few seconds and inevitably found myself drowning. Lucky enough to take a breath without swallowing water, held my breath and submerged. The surprising thing is that I had no feelings of fear, shock or whatsoever. I felt calm, so calm that I didn't resistant fighting back to the surface. My head was up throughout the time I was sinking, sinking slowly. I can still remember how that as if it was as if I felt safe, not worried about dying, as if accepting faith. I still didn't feel that I was running out of breath throughout the time, it was a miracle that I didn't for at least half a minute. A man was passing by and from his point of view he noticed a young figure submerged under the water, aware that this kid might actually need help. Feeling pity, he reached his hand into the water and I have seen the hand reach out to me as it grabs me and pulls me out to the light. I don't remember what happened next but the man was my Dad, breaking down into tears after discovering that he rescued and saved me by chance, having no idea it was me.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

They are the heroes of the Philippines
Many years ago
He did it indefinitely
Such a good show
Lapu-lapu is the first hero
He defeated opponents fiercely
Wants to occupy and oppress
They failed and were defeated
Jose Rizal is the national hero
His brains used to be good
Help the people from being oppressed
In his hometown he was made a servant
Andres Bonifacio father of
KatipunanFought for freedom
Not afraid of foreigners
Not betrayed until death
Apolinario Mabini the great cripple
Handicapped but smart
In the rebellion he was a counselor
Even sick do not beat
Freedom is what we want to achieve
Until the world shrinks
And life became the substitute
In the hands of the cruel foreigner.</h2><br />

Be convincing. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is true that many elder people talk about their good old days before, especially most of them is all about how they work hard and there were no advanced technologies and easier ways to help themselves out in their life. Telling them to their kids or grandchildren means that they were just telling what it was like when it was in their generation. It really is a bit of comparing, but it's just stating both differences and improvements in both generations.</p><p></p><p>Neither of the generation ( old and new ) are perfect and different, but somehow they see the new ones as a harder and more challenging generation, especially our generation now. As what I've experienced from my grandparents and parents, they do tell about their generation but they were also telling it in a way of life's secret lessons, in which thet are explaining it to us, younger ones. I personally think that every generation is not easy, since life isn't easy, but the more years grow the more harder it gets they say. That is why our parents and grandparents are here with us, to help us and guide us what to do in our generation in order to be prepared for the struggles in life.</p><br />

                            14. liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</h2><br />

                        <p>The book of Matthew is one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is believed to have been written by Matthew, a disciple of Jesus, and is primarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The book contains the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of the Kingdom" due to its emphasis on the coming of the Kingdom of God.</p><p></p><p>The book of Mark is also one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Mark, a disciple of Peter, and is primarily focused on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. The book contains Jesus' baptism, temptation, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Action" due to its emphasis on Jesus' deeds rather than his words.</p><p></p><p>The book of John is another one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by John, a disciple of Jesus, and is primarily focused on the divinity of Jesus Christ. The book contains Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Belief" due to its emphasis on the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God.</p><p></p><p>The book of Luke is the third Gospel book in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Luke, a physician and companion of Paul, and is primarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The book contains the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Mercy" due to its emphasis on Jesus' compassion and concern for the poor and marginalized.</p><p></p><p>One of the most well-known Bible verses about the Gospel is John 3:16, which states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse highlights the central message of the Gospel, which is that through faith in Jesus Christ, we can be saved and have eternal life.</p><p></p><p>The Gospel is of utmost importance in the life of Christians because it contains the message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. It provides guidance, comfort, and hope to believers, and helps them to live a life in accordance with God's will.</p><p></p><p>At this moment in my life, the most significant Bible verse that I would use to communicate is Philippians 4:6-7, which states, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." This verse reminds us to trust in God and to bring our worries and concerns to Him in prayer.</p><p></p><p>To help my family read the Bible well, I can encourage them to set aside a specific time each day for Bible reading and prayer, and to choose a Bible study plan or devotional to follow. I can also discuss and reflect on the passages with them to deepen our understanding and share our insights.</p><p></p><p>In this pandemic time, I can apply the teachings of the Gospel by showing compassion and kindness to those who are affected by the virus, and by trusting in God's plan and His protection.</p><p></p><p>Dear God, we pray for your protection and good health during this pandemic time. May you guard our hearts and minds and keep us safe</p><br />

                        <p></p><p>One basic way we use the word “good” is to express moral approval. So when we say someone is living well or that they have lived a good life, we may simply mean that they are a good person, someone who is courageous, honest, trustworthy, kind, selfless, generous, helpful, loyal, principled, and so on.</p><p></p><p>They possess and practice many of the most important virtues. And they don’t spend all their time merely pursuing their own pleasure; they devote a certain amount of time to activities that benefit others, perhaps through their engagement with family and friends, or through their work, or through various voluntary activities.</p><p></p><p>This moral conception of the good life has had plenty of champions. Socrates and Plato both gave absolute priority to being a virtuous person over all other supposedly good things such as pleasure, wealth, or power.</p><p></p><p>In Plato’s dialogue Gorgias, Socrates takes this position to an extreme. He argues that it is much better to suffer wrong than to do it; that a good man who has his eyes gouged out and is tortured to death is more fortunate than a corrupt person who has used wealth and power dishonorably.</p><p></p><p>In his masterpiece, the Republic, Plato develops this argument in greater detail. The morally good person, he claims, enjoys a sort of inner harmony, whereas the wicked person, no matter how rich and powerful he may be or how many pleasure he enjoys, is disharmonious, fundamentally at odds with himself and the world.</p><p></p><p>It is worth noting, though, that in both the Gorgias and the Republic, Plato bolsters his argument with a speculative account of an afterlife in which virtuous people are rewarded and wicked people are punished.</p><p></p><p>Many religions also conceive of the good life in moral terms as a life lived according to God’s laws. A person who lives this way—obeying the commandments and performing the proper rituals—is pious. And in most religions, such piety will be rewarded. Obviously, many people do not receive their reward in this life.</p><p></p><p>But devout believers are confident that their piety will not be in vain. Christian martyrs went singing to their deaths confident that they would soon be in heaven. Hindus expect that the law of karma will ensure that their good deeds and intentions will be rewarded, while evil actions and desires will be punished, either in this life or in future lives.</p><br />

                            21. health is wealth.there is nothing in our life that is more valuable than health. without health, there is no peace, no success and no happiness When we are ill, we do not want to work or play. Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Feb 11, 2018·3 min read</p><p></p><p></p><p>Many people have a definition of what the good life means, but what does it really mean to live “a good life”? Is it helping others all of the time and not caring for yourself or Vic versa; being very selfish and having no remorse for others?</p><p>I think there are subjective things that each individual person will have, but I also think there are certain objective things that everyone should have.</p><p>The first thing should be your health. If you are not healthy and taking care of your body everyday, you are on board for a trip to the bottom because as your body degrades, as you get older, all of the unhealthy foods you have been eating and the months you have been putting off the gym will come back to haunt you. Eating healthy and working out is like cheap health insurance that adds up over time. Why wouldn’t you want to take advantage of that? And you see a lot of business people or people in general who work their butts off for money but they get a disease that ruins their quality of life.</p><p>There is this saying when people are younger, they use their health to get wealth and when they are older, they use their wealth to get back their health. It’s a circular logic and circular is illogical in this case.</p><p>And this isn’t just my opinion, there is amazing science to back this up. Weight lifting reverses the age of your telomeres, aerobic exercises help your brain function better, and etc. Even if you don’t have access to a gym, you can always run around your street.</p><p>The second thing you should have is money. Not just to tally it up, but just enough money to tell yourself,” I am financially independent”. You bread people who say ,”Money is the root of all evil”, but I don’t want to say that in a mean way, but money isn’t the root of all evil. Yes to a certain extent, I can see why people would say money is the root of all evil, but the lack of money should be the root of all evil. Just look at rich and poor countries.</p><p></p>ANSWERED BY: HuYiTian94<br />
