It is the fulfillment of God's plan of salvation through Christ's passing over from this world to the Father. 2. It is a public service participated by the People of God to celebrate the mysteries of the Lord. 3. It is the most worthy place in the Church where the Lord is present. 4. It is the Sacrament instituted by Christ to wash and cleanse the soul from the grave weight of sins committed after baptism by a person with due repentance. 5. It is the only Sacrament where the matter and form are one and the same, "the mutual exchange of consent to accept each other before the Church manifested in words and signs."6. It is a Sacrament which imprints a permanent seal in the soul of a baptized Christian that can be received only once and marks this individual forever as a Christian who acts as a witness for Christ. 7. It is the foundational Sacrament and prerequisite for all other sacraments. 8. It is the first degree in the Sacrament of the Holy Orders inside the Catholic Church whose tasks include teaching, catechizing, proclaiming the Gospel, preaching at Mass, and assisting in the liturgy. 9. It is the Sacrament in which Jesus Christ gives His Body and Blood for us, so that we might give ourselves to Him in love and be united with Him in Holy Communion. 10. It is the last Holy Communion received, which prepares the sick for the final journey. pasagot po plsskailangan ko po ngayun​nonsense answerREREPORT KO PO </a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The four marks of the Church are not characteristics that the Church creates or develops or learns. They are qualities that Jesus Christ shares with his Church through the Holy Spirit. The four marks of the Church are that it is one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO FAVOR LANG THANK YOU </p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS </p><p></p><p></p><p>1.The Church Is One</p><p>Just as God is one in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, so also is the Church one. The founder of the Church is Jesus Christ, who brought us back to God and made us into the family of God. The Church is one in the Holy Spirit, who dwells in those who believe.</p><p></p><p>2.The Church Is Holy</p><p>The Church is holy because the Church lives in union with Jesus Christ, the source of holiness. Through the Holy Spirit the Church leads others to holiness. The holiness of the Church is seen in the love that the members of the Church have toward one another and the many sacrifices they make for the sake of the world.</p><p></p><p>3.The Church Is Catholic</p><p>Catholic means “universal.” The Church is universal in two ways. First, the Church is catholic because all baptized people are part of the Church and the Church possesses the means of salvation. Second, the mission of the Church is universal because the Church has been sent to proclaim Christ to the entire human race.</p><p></p><p>4.The Church Is Apostolic</p><p>The Church traces its tradition directly from the apostles; therefore, the Church is considered apostolic. With the Holy Spirit the Church preserves and continues the teaching of the apostles. The pope and bishops are the successors of the apostles.</p><br />
