Every newexperience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good or bad, each instancechanged the course that my life has taken. But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</a>

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

Directions: Read the following excerpts [from essays] carefully. Then, write N if the text is Narrative, D if Descriptive, E if Expository, and P if Persuasive. Write the letter of the correct answer on the space provided before the number.
______11. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains.
______12. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future.
______13. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying.
______14. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN Security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001). Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorist activities are not always favorable.

It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike in the mountains. ___2.Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and more compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future.___3. Though cell phones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating, distracting students by the possibility to access the internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cell phones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon as cyberbullying. ___4. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska. America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old. George and Terry, my two best friends and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.___5. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 ( Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were much higher than today.​</a>

                            1. My most unforgettable experience in my life essay minimum 500 words?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There have been many experiences in my life that I would consider unforgettable, but one in particular stands out as the most significant and impactful.</p><p></p><p>It was the summer before my senior year of high school, and I had the opportunity to participate in a study abroad program in a small town in France. I had always been interested in French language and culture, so I jumped at the chance to immerse myself in it for a few weeks.</p><p></p><p>From the moment I arrived, I was struck by how different everything was from what I was used to. The language, the food, the customs – everything was new and exciting. I was nervous about communicating with my host family, but they were incredibly welcoming and patient with my limited French skills.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of the program, I had the chance to explore the town and surrounding areas, attend language classes, and participate in cultural activities. But the most memorable experience of all was the weekend I spent with a group of local teenagers.</p><p></p><p>Through a mutual friend, I was invited to join a group of French teens on a camping trip in the mountains. I was nervous about spending the weekend with strangers, especially since my French was far from perfect, but I was also excited for the adventure.</p><p></p><p>As we hiked up the mountain, I struggled to keep up with the conversation and understand the jokes and cultural references. But the other teens were patient and inclusive, making an effort to include me and help me understand.</p><p></p><p>That night, as we sat around the campfire, I realized that I was experiencing something truly special. Here I was, in the middle of the French Alps, surrounded by new friends who had taken me in as one of their own. We talked and laughed and shared stories late into the night, and I knew that I would never forget this moment.</p><p></p><p>As the weekend came to a close and we said our goodbyes, I felt a sense of sadness that it was all ending. But I also knew that I had gained so much from this experience – not just a deeper understanding of French culture, but also a newfound appreciation for the power of human connection.</p><p></p><p>In the years since that summer, I have gone on to have many other incredible experiences, but none have quite matched the magic of that weekend in the mountains. It taught me that even when we feel out of place or uncomfortable, there is always the potential for connection and friendship – and that those moments of connection are the ones that stay with us for a lifetime.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>It was a dark and a little bit cold night. One of my friends suggested that we go outside for star seeing. We started from the cabana we lived in with a touch in each one’s hand. At first we just wanted to go around and appreciated the beautiful sky decorated by many stars. But then we decided to go further in. All we thought about was walking and talking. We ignored the most important thing which is the big forest was beyond the cabana. It was unfortunate that we went into the forest and got lost.</p><p>IMG_20161208_061206.jpp</p><p>When we found we were lost, it was too late to find the original way back to the cabana. I grasped my friends hands firmly. The cold and strong wind blew against my face all the time. It whispers through the trees. What’s more, the fog became thick quickly. Terrible fear came to my mind and made me tremble out of my control. I was sacred to death. The only idea came into my brain was that it was the end of my life. It was impossible for me to get out of the forest. Even though my friends tried to convince me that nothing bad would happen to us and we were safe and sound. I still feared that we would come to a sticky end.</p><p>It was hard to find the way clear because of the dense fog. It made us lose the sense of direction totally. We didn’t know which step to follow next. Suddenly, it seemed that a man with a torch stood in front of us. At first, it frightened us stiff. We dared not to open oureyes until he came to pat on our shoulders and told us that if we got lost, he would help us to find the way. At this moment, I was relieved because I knew I wouldn’t stay in the forest all the time. This kind man led us to go out. It was him who ended up this terrible experience of getting lost.</p><p>It was really an unforgettable experience in my life. I wil</p><br />

                            2. ESSAY PO GAWIN How did you experience the Holy Spirit in my life and how can you best console others who are introuble?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I have an experience I will never forget. When I was in Manila, I loved to play with my friends. We roam everywhere. But one day, I went with my friends to go for a walk. When we got home, they left me and I did not know where I was going. I'm lost. I did not know what to do but I had only one thought, to pray. So I prayed for the Holy Spirit to show me where I was going. That is, I did not lose because I remembered what we went through. I thank the Lord for not misleading me. If I console other people who are in trouble, I can only say one thing. Let them believe in the Lord because they will be saved.</p><p></p><p>(Totoo po yan, hindi po yan gawa-gawa.

                        <p></p><p></p>"The Most Unforgettable Experience of My Life"<p></p><p><strong>Setting: </strong>It was a warm summer evening, and the sun was setting over the ocean. I was on a small island in the Caribbean, where my family and I had decided to spend our vacation. We had rented a beautiful villa that overlooked the sea, and the sound of the waves was the only thing we could hear.</p><p></p><p><strong>Conflict:</strong> As we were enjoying our time on the island, a sudden storm hit. The winds were strong, and the rain was heavy. Our villa was located on the beach, and we soon realized that the rising tides had flooded the area. We were trapped in our villa, and we couldn't leave. The power went out, and the storm showed no signs of stopping.</p><p></p><p><strong>Plot:</strong> My family and I were stuck in the villa, and we didn't know what to do. We tried to contact the villa management, but the phone lines were down. We were running low on food, and the water was contaminated. We had to come up with a plan to survive until the storm passed.</p><p></p><p>We decided to use the remaining supplies to build a makeshift shelter on the roof of the villa. We used towels and blankets to cover ourselves from the rain and wind. We huddled together, trying to keep warm and dry. We spent three long days and nights on the roof, surviving on canned food and bottled water.</p><p></p><p>Finally, on the fourth day, the storm subsided, and the sun came out. We were rescued by a group of locals who had come to check on us. They took us to a nearby shelter, where we were able to get food, water, and medical attention.</p><p></p><p><strong>Theme:</strong> This experience taught me the value of family, teamwork, and perseverance. It reminded me that no matter how difficult a situation may seem, we can always find a way to overcome it. I also realized that we take many things for granted in our daily lives, like access to clean water and electricity. This experience made me appreciate these things more and never take them for granted again.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the stormy days and nights that we spent on the rooftop of our villa in the Caribbean were the most unforgettable experience of my life. It was a reminder that we are not invincible, and sometimes we have to rely on others to get through tough times. But most importantly, it taught me the value of resilience, gratitude, and the strength of the human spirit.</p><br />

                        <p>ANSWER </p><p></p><p>The Most Unforgettable Experience of My Life</p><p></p><p>Setting: </p><p></p><p>I had always been an adventurous person and loved to explore new and exciting places. One summer, my family decided to take a trip to a remote island on the Atlantic Ocean. The island was surrounded by crystal clear waters and was home to some of the most exquisite wildlife I had ever encountered. We decided to rent a small boat and explore the island's surroundings. As we made our way through the waters, little did we know that we were about to experience the most unforgettable moment of our lives.</p><p></p><p>Conflict:</p><p></p><p>As we reached the middle of the ocean, the weather began to change. Strong winds started to blow, and the waves grew bigger and stronger. Our small boat began to rock back and forth, and we realized that we were in the midst of a storm. We tried to steer the boat towards the island's shore, but our efforts were in vain. The engine was not strong enough to fight the strong winds that pushed us back.</p><p></p><p>Plot:</p><p></p><p>As the storm grew stronger, we lost control of the boat, and it was thrown violently from side to side. Then, suddenly, we heard a loud snap, and the mast broke in half. We were now stranded in the middle of the ocean, with no way to control the boat or call for help. Panic set in, and we knew that we had to act fast if we wanted to survive.</p><p></p><p>We quickly tied ourselves to the boat's railing and huddled together for warmth. The storm raged on, and we feared that we might not make it through the night. But miraculously, the storm began to subside, and the winds died down. The sun began to rise on the horizon, and we were relieved to see land in the distance.</p><p></p><p>We slowly made our way towards the island's shore, and as we stepped onto solid ground, we realized that we had just experienced the most unforgettable experience of our lives.</p><p></p><p>Theme:</p><p></p><p>The experience taught us the importance of perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity. It was a reminder that life is unpredictable, and we must be prepared for anything that comes our way. It also taught us the value of teamwork and the importance of relying on each other in times of crisis. The experience was a humbling reminder of the fragility of life and the power of nature, and it left an indelible mark on our souls. From that day on, we vowed to cherish every moment, to embrace every adventure, and to never take life for granted.</p><br />

Every newexperience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good or bad, each instancechanged the course that my life has taken. But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>. </p><p></p><p>The Most Unforgettable Experience of My Life</p><p></p>As I reflect on my life, there is one experience that stands out as the most unforgettable. It was a summer evening in the small town where I grew up, and my friends and I were out for a walk, exploring the nearby woods. The setting was idyllic, with the sun setting behind us and the sounds of nature surrounding us.<p></p>Suddenly, we heard a loud crashing sound in the distance. We initially thought it was just a fallen tree, but as we continued walking, we realized it was something much more serious. We saw a car off the road and in a ditch, with smoke rising from the engine. As we got closer, we saw that the driver was trapped inside and screaming for help.<p></p>The conflict was immediate and intense. My friends and I knew we had to act quickly to save the driver's life. We had no idea how to extricate someone from a car, but we knew we had to try. We called 911 and then worked to get the driver out of the car. It was a terrifying experience, as the car was smoking and we didn't know if it was going to explode at any moment.<p></p>As we worked to free the driver, the plot unfolded. We were able to get the door open, and we carefully lifted the driver out of the car and onto the ground. He was badly injured, and we did what we could to keep him comfortable while we waited for the ambulance to arrive. It was a chaotic scene, with police and fire trucks arriving on the scene, but we were able to keep the driver stable until he could be taken to the hospital.<p></p>The theme of this experience was one of community and bravery. My friends and I were just ordinary teenagers, but when faced with a life-or-death situation, we acted with courage and selflessness. We put ourselves in harm's way to help a stranger, and in doing so, we showed the power of human kindness and compassion.<p></p>In conclusion, the most unforgettable experience of my life was the night my friends and I saved a driver from a burning car. The setting was peaceful, the conflict was intense, the plot was unpredictable, and the theme was one of community and bravery. This experience taught me that in moments of crisis, ordinary people can do extraordinary things, and that the power of kindness and compassion can truly change the world.<br />

                            14. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                        <p></p><p></p><p>The Most Unforgettable Experience of My Life</p><p></p><p>As I reflect on my life, there is one experience that stands out as the most unforgettable. It was a summer evening in the small town where I grew up, and my friends and I were out for a walk, exploring the nearby woods. The setting was idyllic, with the sun setting behind us and the sounds of nature surrounding us.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, we heard a loud crashing sound in the distance. We initially thought it was just a fallen tree, but as we continued walking, we realized it was something much more serious. We saw a car off the road and in a ditch, with smoke rising from the engine. As we got closer, we saw that the driver was trapped inside and screaming for help.</p><p></p><p>The conflict was immediate and intense. My friends and I knew we had to act quickly to save the driver's life. We had no idea how to extricate someone from a car, but we knew we had to try. We called 911 and then worked to get the driver out of the car. It was a terrifying experience, as the car was smoking and we didn't know if it was going to explode at any moment.</p><p></p><p>As we worked to free the driver, the plot unfolded. We were able to get the door open, and we carefully lifted the driver out of the car and onto the ground. He was badly injured, and we did what we could to keep him comfortable while we waited for the ambulance to arrive. It was a chaotic scene, with police and fire trucks arriving on the scene, but we were able to keep the driver stable until he could be taken to the hospital.</p><p></p><p>The theme of this experience was one of community and bravery. My friends and I were just ordinary teenagers, but when faced with a life-or-death situation, we acted with courage and selflessness. We put ourselves in harm's way to help a stranger, and in doing so, we showed the power of human kindness and compassion.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the most unforgettable experience of my life was the night my friends and I saved a driver from a burning car. The setting was peaceful, the conflict was intense, the plot was unpredictable, and the theme was one of community and bravery. This experience taught me that in moments of crisis, ordinary people can do extraordinary things, and that the power of kindness and compassion can truly change the world.</p><br />

What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained.

                        The Most Unforgettable Experience of My Life<p></p><p>Setting:</p><p>It was a hot summer day in the small town of La Fortuna, located in the northwestern region of Costa Rica.

The rush of the wind in my face and the feeling of freedom was indescribable. I couldn't believe that I was actually doing it, and I felt like I was on top of the world.</p><p></p><p>As the tour continued, we came to a particularly challenging zip line. It was longer and higher than the others, and I could feel my nerves starting to get the best of me. However, I knew that I couldn't let my fear get in the way of this once-in-a-lifetime experience. I took a deep breath and launched myself off the platform, hurtling towards the distant tree line.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, I felt a jolt, and my harness started to loosen. I looked down and saw that I was slipping out of the harness, and I knew that I was in serious trouble. Panic set in as I realized that I was hundreds of feet above the ground with no way to stop myself from falling.</p><p></p><p>Theme:</p><p>In that terrifying moment, I learned the true meaning of courage. I knew that I had a choice: I could give in to my fear and let myself fall, or I could fight with everything I had to stay alive. I chose the latter, and with every ounce of strength I had left, I managed to grab onto the harness and pull myself back up.</p><p></p><p>Although the experience was terrifying, it taught me an important lesson about myself. I realized that I was capable of more than I ever thought possible, and that I could overcome even the most difficult challenges if I was willing to face my fears head-on. As I completed the rest of the zip-lining tour, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that I had never felt before.</p><p></p><p>Looking back on that experience, I realize how much it has shaped me as a person. Since that day, I have been more willing to take risks and push myself out of my comfort zone. I have also learned to appreciate the beauty of life and the importance of living in the moment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the most unforgettable experience of my life was the day I faced my fears and overcame them during a zip-lining tour in Costa Rica. It was a moment that tested my courage and showed me what I was truly capable of. Although it was a scary experience, it taught me a valuable lesson that I will never forget.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Grandparents</p><p>I was lucky enough to grow up in my grandparent’s house. Our family lived with my grandparents since I was little. As my paternal grandfather passed away when I was very young, I only remember a few memories of him. One thing I surely remember is he used to brush his teeth twice daily without fail. I adopted this habit and ever since I have been doing the same.</p><p></p><p>My maternal grandparents have been my true systems of support. I am lucky enough to have grown up around such inspirational people. My grandfather was a principal of a college, so he always emphasized the importance of education. He helped us with our homework when my parents were not available. I spent my vacations at their place as I enjoyed living with them.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, my grandparents always embraced me with open arms. They used to wait for every holiday for our arrival. My grandmother made delicious pickles and meals which we relished greatly. She taught me a few recipes too and tips and tricks that are very useful even today. I simply adore my grandparents for instilling good values in me and my parents and for giving us a safe space to grow up in.</p><br />
