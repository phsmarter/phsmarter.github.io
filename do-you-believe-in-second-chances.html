                                            ANSWER PLSSS ASAP Text A I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this ? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't. It is actually actually the tip of an enermous goblin moon base. How do I know that? the goblins told me so. I have special phone line from my house to the moon- goblins, and through me, they can answer any question you've got. Our moon-door is always open, the goblins tell me. Text B Earth has just one moon - a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon "glowing" in the darkness. The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life. It's no wonder that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. What makes the Moon glow? The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming shape each night from the Sun. Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape? From Earth, it might look like the Moon is our spot on Earth, we see - from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What's actually happening is that from different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. Is there actually a "dark side" of the Moon? No. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side. "Even thousands of years ago, humans drew pictures to track the changes of the Moon. Later, people used their observations of the Moon to create calendars. Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited. On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first people to set foot on the dusty surface of the Moon. Ten other American astronauts followed. They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Using a Venn Diagram compare the two text.

You may modify the sample outline format presented before. This I Believe Carlos P. Romulo I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration.

                                            Of More Value By Jerry B Jenkins A friend, a father of two daughters, admits he does not mind putting a line fear into the boys trying to have a date with his daughter. His daughters are sometimes embarrassed when their father asks for a few moments alone with their date, and he would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy that he is a mean, protective father to his daughters Besides, he believes that there is no such thing as being overprotective. Another friend says he uses sports analogy to get his point across He would tell the boy, "If I owned the most expensive, exotic sports cars on the road and I let you take it for a spin, you'd be careful with it wouldn't you?" "Oh yes, Sir, you bet. " "You'd treat it better than it was your own wouldn't you?" "Yes, Sir." "I wouldn't want to think you were screeching the tires, would 17 "No. Sir" "Well, let me tell you something, just so we're straight with each other, man to man My daughter is of infinitively more value to me than any car could be. Do you got my drift? She's on loan from me to you for the next few hours and I wouldnt want to discover that she's treated with any less care or respect that I would give here. I'm responsible for her. She's mine. Im entrusting her to you. That trust gives no second chance Understood?" By then, of course, the young man is wondering why he didn't ask someone else out. He's only nodding, unable to speak Most often, he brings the gat home earlier than promised. The daughter might even complain about her father's approach, but deep down, she feels loved and cherished and you can be sure she'll marry a man who treats her that way C. DEVELOPING THE SKILLS Read the questions carefully and write your answers below. 1. How does the first father show he values his daughter? 2. How does the sports analogy of the second father affect the boy asking permission to date his daughter? 3. Which of the two fathers do you think has a better approach to their daughters' suitors?​</a>

                            5. ANSWER PLSSS ASAP Text A I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this ? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't. It is actually actually the tip of an enermous goblin moon base. How do I know that? the goblins told me so. I have special phone line from my house to the moon- goblins, and through me, they can answer any question you've got. Our moon-door is always open, the goblins tell me. Text B Earth has just one moon - a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon "glowing" in the darkness. The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life. It's no wonder that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one that we can easily see most nights. What makes the Moon glow? The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply reflects light coming shape each night from the Sun. Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape? From Earth, it might look like the Moon is our spot on Earth, we see - from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. What's actually happening is that from different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit. Is there actually a "dark side" of the Moon? No. The Moon rotates on its own axis at the same rate that it orbits around Earth. That means we always see the same side of the Moon from our position on Earth. The side we don't see gets just as much light, so a more accurate name for that part of the Moon is the "far side. "Even thousands of years ago, humans drew pictures to track the changes of the Moon. Later, people used their observations of the Moon to create calendars. Today, we study the Moon using telescopes and spacecraft. For example, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been circling the Moon and sending back measurements since 2009. The Moon is the only other planetary body that humans have visited. On July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first people to set foot on the dusty surface of the Moon. Ten other American astronauts followed. They collected hundreds of pounds of lunar soil and rock samples, conducted experiments and installed equipment for follow-up measurements. Using a Venn Diagram compare the two text. Refer to the comprehensive questions below as your guide in writing the content of your diagram. 1. What are the difference between two passages? 2. What are the similarities of the two passages? 3.

They also mention the moon landings conducted by American astronauts and the collection of lunar soil and rock samples as evidence of human exploration of the moon.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The first passage discusses the belief in a colony of goblins living inside the moon, while the second passage provides factual information about the moon such as its size, distance from Earth, and the way it reflects light from the sun. The first passage is also more imaginative and unrealistic compared to the second passage. </p><p>2. Both passages talk about the moon and its significance in human history. They both also explain how the moon appears to change shape from Earth and clarify that the moon does not shine with its own light. </p><p>3. The author of the first passage has a belief in a colony of goblins living inside the moon, and they claim that the government is hiding this information. The author of the second passage presents factual information and does not express any belief or point of view.</p><p>4. The first author provides no evidence for their claim, aside from saying that the goblins have told them so through a special phone line. The second author provides evidence such as the Moon's size, distance from Earth, the way it reflects light, and information on human exploration of the Moon, including the lunar missions conducted by NASA.</p><p></p><p>Consider</p><p><strong>•Brainliest - Choose this answer as the best answer if you think it is the most helpful and informative.</strong></p><p></p><p>•Upvote/like - Show appreciation for the answer by clicking the upvote or like button.</p><p></p><p>•Comment/critique - Give constructive feedback on the answer, pointing out what is correct and what can be improved.</p><p></p><p>•Rate - Rate the answer on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how helpful it was.</p><p></p><p><strong>•Follow - Click the "Follow" button to stay updated on future answers and posts by the author.</strong></p><p></p><p>#Lazy learning to the rescue</p><p>#God bless</p><p>#Learning fast and easy</p><p>#Accurate answer</p><p>#Chillax</p><p></p><p></p><br />

You may modify the sample outline format presented before. This I Believe Carlos P. Romulo I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</h2><br />

                            12. Of More Value By Jerry B Jenkins A friend, a father of two daughters, admits he does not mind putting a line fear into the boys trying to have a date with his daughter. His daughters are sometimes embarrassed when their father asks for a few moments alone with their date, and he would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy that he is a mean, protective father to his daughters Besides, he believes that there is no such thing as being overprotective. Another friend says he uses sports analogy to get his point across He would tell the boy, "If I owned the most expensive, exotic sports cars on the road and I let you take it for a spin, you'd be careful with it wouldn't you?" "Oh yes, Sir, you bet. " "You'd treat it better than it was your own wouldn't you?" "Yes, Sir." "I wouldn't want to think you were screeching the tires, would 17 "No. Sir" "Well, let me tell you something, just so we're straight with each other, man to man My daughter is of infinitively more value to me than any car could be. Do you got my drift? She's on loan from me to you for the next few hours and I wouldnt want to discover that she's treated with any less care or respect that I would give here. I'm responsible for her. She's mine. Im entrusting her to you. That trust gives no second chance Understood?" By then, of course, the young man is wondering why he didn't ask someone else out. He's only nodding, unable to speak Most often, he brings the gat home earlier than promised. The daughter might even complain about her father's approach, but deep down, she feels loved and cherished and you can be sure she'll marry a man who treats her that way C. DEVELOPING THE SKILLS Read the questions carefully and write your answers below. 1. How does the first father show he values his daughter? 2. How does the sports analogy of the second father affect the boy asking permission to date his daughter? 3. Which of the two fathers do you think has a better approach to their daughters' suitors?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The first father shows that he values his daughter by being protective of her and trying to scare off potential suitors who might not treat her well. He would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy than not being a mean, protective father to his daughters.</p><p>2. The sports analogy of the second father puts pressure on the boy asking permission to date his daughter by suggesting that the father's daughter is of infinite more value than any car, and that the boy must treat her with the same care and respect as he would the father's sports car.</p><p>3. Both fathers have their own approaches, but the second father's approach may be more effective in getting his point across and making sure that the boy understands the responsibility he is taking on when asking to date his daughter.</p><br />

                            15. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                            16. Second Quarter Project Directions: Read the model argumentative essay, identify the parts by rewriting the important or the essential statements in the box. Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.
