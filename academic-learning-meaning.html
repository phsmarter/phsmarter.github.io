                            12. what features of academic writing means the words that you need to learn​</h2><br />
                        Answer:<p></p><p>→The ways we write are influenced by our purpose. We write differently when communicating with our friends, reporting on events, telling stories. At university, the type of writing that you will be expected to produce in your assessment tasks is classified as ‘academic writing’. The purpose of academic writing is to analyse or produce knowledge</p><p></p>Explanation:<p>→The tone used in academic writing is usually formal, meaning that it should not sound conversational or casual. You should particularly avoid colloquial, idiomatic, slang, or journalistic expressions in favour of precise vocabulary. Informal and colloquial language is often imprecise, so is open to misinterpretation, and can be inaccessible to non-native English speakers.</p><p></p><p>→For example, ‘international business heavyweights’ is too informal. Better wording would be ‘leading international businesses’ if referring to corporations, or ‘international business leaders’ if referring to individuals.</p><p></p><p>→Academic writing requires that you use full forms rather than contractions. For example, write ‘do not’ instead of ‘don't’, ‘it is’ instead of ‘it's’, ‘they have’ instead of ‘they've’ and ‘we will’ instead of ‘we'll’.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#CaryOnLearning</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
