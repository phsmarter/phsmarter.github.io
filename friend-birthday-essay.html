                        <p><strong>INSPIRED BY JESUS' TEMPTATION</strong></p><p>In some faiths, temptation is defined as the desire to indulge in short-term pleasures that jeopardize long-term goals. In some religions, temptation is defined as the desire to commit a sin. The persuading or inducing of a person into committing such an act, by manipulation or otherwise of curiosity, desire, or fear of losing something vital to a person, is also referred to as temptation.</p><p>1. I know that my friend is just concerned to me because of the family problem that I'm facing and to the consequence I may get if I will be late in passing my module but I will not allow myself to dwell with problems anymore. I will try my very best to answer my module on my own since I still have two days left.</p><p>2. A bundle of thousand peso bills and an iPhone 13 will eventually help me get a grandiose birthday party and I can even invite many friends but that is only a short lived happiness. My guilt will haunt me if I will not find the owner of the handbag. I will return the handbag to the sales lady so if the owner will return she can thanked me and who knows she will award me with my good deed.</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/24830621</p><p><strong>#LETSSTUDY</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />
