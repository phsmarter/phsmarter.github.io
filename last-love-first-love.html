                                            THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

                                            The Martyr Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry After all, at some point in your life That love was the most important thing to you, That love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, That love made you believe that destiny does exist, And that love made you question, Why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't even think twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, I was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, Just so I could be with you. All I ever did was care for you. All I ever did was to make you happy. And all I ever did was love you. Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry But I needed to ask forgiveness from the one who was hurt the most… Myself 1. what is the imagery of the poem? 2. what is the mood of the poem?​</a>

Who is the poetic persona of the poem?2. What is that line in the first stanza that is repeated in the second? What is the difference in meaning between the two? Why is there a question mark? 3. We have the lines "Till seashells are broken pieces/From God's own bright teeth" in the last stanza. What does this imply? How does God show His great love? Can you cite evidences or stories that affirm His love? 4. How is love being portrayed in the poem? 5. In the third stanza, why do you think the speaker mentions that all love is to be scaled down? How do you scale down your love? Give examples.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The poetic persona of the poem is not explicitly stated, but it is likely the author herself, Edith Tiempo.The line that is repeated in the first and second stanza is "All that I love". The difference in meaning between the two is that in the first stanza, it seems to be a rhetorical question, while in the second stanza, it is being affirmed that all the things mentioned are indeed things that the speaker loves.The line "Till seashells are broken pieces/From God's own bright teeth" implies that even the smallest and seemingly insignificant things in life are evidence of God's great love. This is seen in the beauty and intricacy of seashells, which are created by God. Examples of stories that affirm God's love could include the story of Jesus sacrificing himself for humanity or the story of the prodigal son in the Bible.Love is being portrayed as something that is cherished and valued, and that can be kept and treasured in small, physical objects.In the third stanza, the speaker mentions scaling down love to emphasize the importance of keeping memories and cherished objects in a compact and tangible form. Scaling down love allows the speaker to keep all that she loves with her at all times, making it easier to remember and cherish the memories associated with those objects. Scaling down love can be done in different ways depending on the individual. For example, keeping sentimental items in a small box or container, carrying a locket or other small keepsake, or even just taking photographs of special moments or objects can help scale down love into something tangible and manageable.<p></p><br />

                            20. THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.
