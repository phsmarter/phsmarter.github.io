Philippine Politics and Governance </strong></p><p>I learned about the three branches of the government. We also learned how a bill becomes a law. So we had an activity in where we create a bill and present it. Then our classmates will become divided into Congress and Senate and will decide if they will approve the bill. </p><p></p><p><strong>2. Discipline and Ideas in the Social Sciences </strong></p><p>Usually social sciences include Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology and sometimes Criminology, Education, Geography, Law, Psychiatry, Philosophy, Religion and history.</p><p>Mostly, we were introduced to important evens in the past centuries like the Crusades, the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution. We also took a deep dive into the World War II events. </p><p>We had reporting for the Common Wealth government and the Philippine's shift to Republic Government. </p><p> </p><p><strong>3. Introduction of World Religions and Belief System </strong></p><p>What matters is therefore not the content of beliefs, but the role they play in the life of believers. “Religious practice does not flow from belief, as a conclusion of premises, but belief consists in practice</p><p>We compared different religious system and philosophies in Asia and Africa.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Discipline and Ideas in the Applied Social Sciences </strong></p><p>The humanities and social sciences mainly include the following disciplines: Anthropology; Archeology; Geography and Demography; Story ; Linguistics and Semiology; Memetic; Philosophy ; Psychology, Ergonomics and Cognitics; Sciences of religions; Economics (or Economics);</p><p>Applied Social Sciences are equally difficult. Because we have to base it in the reality of people living diversely. These situations are outside the textbook examples. So, we had to create essays and thesis about human experiences. Example, like discrimination and gender. Poverty and economy. </p><p></p><p><strong>5. Creative Writing </strong></p><p></p><p>The practice of creative writing covers different types of writing and aims to affirm one's personal voice from a diligent practice of literary writing and the development of critical reflexivity. Group dynamics are favored there, on the principle of writing in the workshop.</p><p>We wrote essays like argumentative and persuasive. </p><p></p><p><strong>6. Community Engagement, Solidarity, and Citizenship </strong></p><p>Civic engagement includes both political and non-political processes that aim to improve the quality of life of a population, whether at the community or societal level.</p><p>Investigating about policies were the highlight of these activities. </p><p></p><p><strong>7. Creative Nonfiction </strong></p><p>Writing about essays on global situations like the pandemic. Blogging about discrimination and travelling that involves globalization. </p><p></p><p>8. Trends, Networks, and Critical Thinking in the 21st Century Now that you have chosen your springboard in accomplishing this subject It is important to follow the step-by-step procedures in implementing a program As a social sciences advocate, the welfare of the community is one of the prior ties.​</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/25601389</p><br />
