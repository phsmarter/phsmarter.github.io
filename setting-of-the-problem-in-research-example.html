This research paper explains the psychological and emotional effects of a support program for employees with mental illness. The program involved extended and individualized support for employment candidates through a job support agency that maintained contact with candidates after initial job placement to offer support in various ways. I used a 50% random sampling of individuals who took part in the support program through the job support agency between April and October, and who fit the study criteria I developed from previous and similar studies.

Generally, older workers are more likely than workers of other ages to remain unemployed long term (Barrington 2015). Barrington (2015) suggests that ageist thinking is very much present in workplaces across America, and more supportive, inclusive workplaces are needed for older employees. Older women may be set at a further disadvantage because they tend to face additional discrimination based on gender (Barrnett 2005). (Source: Barrington, Linda. 2015. "Ageism and Bias in the American Workplace." Journal of the American Society on Aging 3) (Clue: It is provides an overview of current knowledge, allowing to identify relevant theories, methods and gaps in existing research.) 23​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>attack on titan in history ohh</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Study design depends greatly on the nature of the research question. In other words, knowing what kind of information the study should collect is a first step in determining how the study will be carried out (also known as the methodology).
</p><p>
</p><p>Let’s say we want to investigate the relationship between daily walking and cholesterol levels in the body. One of the first things we’d have to determine is the type of study that will tell us the most about that relationship. Do we want to compare cholesterol levels among different populations of walkers and non-walkers at the same point in time? Or, do we want to measure cholesterol levels in a single population of daily walkers over an extended period of time?
</p><p>
</p><p>The first approach is typical of a cross-sectional study. The second requires a longitudinal study. To make our choice, we need to know more about the benefits and purpose of each study type.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cross-sectional study
</p><p>Both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal studies are observational studies. This means that researchers record information about their subjects without manipulating the study environment. In our study, we would simply measure the cholesterol levels of daily walkers and non-walkers along with any other characteristics that might be of interest to us. We would not influence non-walkers to take up that activity, or advise daily walkers to modify their behaviour. In short, we’d try not to interfere.
</p><p>
</p><p>The defining feature of a cross-sectional study is that it can compare different population groups at a single point in time. Think of it in terms of taking a snapshot. Findings are drawn from whatever fits into the frame.
</p><p>
</p><p>To return to our example, we might choose to measure cholesterol levels in daily walkers across two age groups, over 40 and under 40, and compare these to cholesterol levels among non-walkers in the same age groups. We might even create subgroups for gender. However, we would not consider past or future cholesterol levels, for these would fall outside the frame. We would look only at cholesterol levels at one point in time.
</p><p>
</p><p>The benefit of a cross-sectional study design is that it allows researchers to compare many different variables at the same time. We could, for example, look at age, gender, income and educational level in relation to walking and cholesterol levels, with little or no additional cost.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, cross-sectional studies may not provide definite information about cause-and-effect relationships. This is because such studies offer a snapshot of a single moment in time; they do not consider what happens before or after the snapshot is taken. Therefore, we can’t know for sure if our daily walkers had low cholesterol levels before taking up their exercise regimes, or if the behaviour of daily walking helped to reduce cholesterol levels that previously were high.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

This research paper explains the psychological and emotional effects of a support program for employees with mental illness. The program involved extended and individualized support for employment candidates through a job support agency that maintained contact with candidates after initial job placement to offer support in various ways. I used a 50% random sampling of individuals who took part in the support program through the job support agency between April and October, and who fit the study criteria I developed from previous and similar studies.

Generally, older workers are more likely than workers of other ages to remain unemployed long term (Barrington 2015). Barrington (2015) suggests that ageist thinking is very much present in workplaces across America, and more supportive, inclusive workplaces are needed for older employees. Older women may be set at a further disadvantage because they tend to face additional discrimination based on gender (Barrnett 2005). (Source: Barrington, Linda. 2015.
