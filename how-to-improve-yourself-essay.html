                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here's a few things that you can do to improve yourself for school: Start reading books now in preparation for studying. Remember to always be nice, courteous and respectful to all. Find a group of friends that you like and like you. These are the kinds of people that won't try to make you be different. try to hang out with these people as much as possible to develop a good relationship with them. These will most likely be your lifelong friends, so be good to them. Do your homework. How are you going to find yourself in a career if you flunk out? And if you are rich and your parents will pay then you better take that free ride. If you don't, you will live in your hometown your whole life and always talk about highschool with the other losers who never found out who they were, or who they wanted to be.</p><br />

                        <p>It's human nature to resist change--particularly when it comes in the form of adversity or challenges. But change is inevitable, and developing the trait of resilience helps us not only survive change, but also learn, grow, and thrive in it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Resilience is the capacity to cope with stress and adversity. It comes from believing in yourself and, at the same time, in something bigger than yourself.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Resilience is not a trait that people are born with; it involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions tha can be learned and developed in anyone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Often the hardest changes to understand and adjust to are the ones that are unexpected and out of our control – a recession, a global pandemic or a major disaster, for example. Changes of this magnitude can be difficult to come to terms with, but you'll often find that your experience of them can be made better or worse depending on your reaction and your attitude.</p><p></p><br />

Subjects with underrating and resistant attitudes with pessimism/helplessness seem to have a low potential for lifestyle change while those with resistant attitudes without pessimism and helplessness may have the most significant potential for lifestyle change.

                        <p>As a community leader, my primary goal would be to create positive social change and improve the lives of the people in my community. To achieve this goal, I would adopt various strategies to empower people and encourage them to actively participate in community development activities.</p><p></p><p>The first step I would take as a community leader is to identify the key issues affecting the community. This would involve engaging with community members through surveys, meetings, and other forms of consultations to understand their needs and concerns. Once these issues have been identified, I would work with community members, local authorities, and other stakeholders to develop strategies to address them.</p><p></p><p>One of the strategies I would adopt to effect positive social change is to promote community education and awareness. This would involve organizing community forums, workshops, and training programs to educate community members on issues such as health, education, and the environment. By providing people with the knowledge and skills they need to make informed decisions, I believe we can improve the quality of life in our community.</p><p></p><p>Another strategy I would use as a community leader is to promote community involvement and participation. This would involve creating opportunities for people to actively participate in decision-making processes and community development activities. By involving people in the decision-making process, we can ensure that their voices are heard, and their concerns are addressed.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these strategies, I would also work to promote economic development and job creation in our community. This would involve working with local businesses and entrepreneurs to create job opportunities and support economic growth. By creating employment opportunities and supporting local businesses, we can improve the economic well-being of our community.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, as a community leader, my primary goal would be to effect positive social change and improve the lives of the people in my community. Through community education, participation, and economic development, I believe we can create a better future for ourselves and our children. By working together and taking a collaborative approach, we can build a stronger and more vibrant community that we can all be proud of.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

and how it affected you in improving yourself as a Filipino and
your way of life in the real world?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:‘Be proud of being a Filipino’
</strong></p><p><strong>What is the best the thing I have done for my country? I actually don’t know because at my age, it is impossible to do something big. Then I realized it isn’t important on how big it is. I think the best thing I’ve done for my country is to be proud that I am a Filipino.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Being proud that I am a Filipino is not quite easy. Sometimes, I even doubt it because of our government. The people have to rally on the streets to get what they want. I feel like it is telling me that we have to go to war first before we can gain peace. When I was in Grade 7, we studied Philippine history. I then appreciated peace. It was not just about the Filipinos fighting the Spanish but how we fought for our independence.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Now, if someone will ask me what is the best thing that I have done for our country, I will tell him or her that I am proud to be a Filipino.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>– Jen Denielle R. Hernandez, Grade 9
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>‘Give respect’
</strong></p><p><strong>There are many heroes and heroines who have done big things for the Philippines: Andres Bonifacio, who sacrificed and gave everything for the sake of the Philippines; Melchora Aquino, who risked her life to help the Katipuneros; Dr. Jose Rizal, who is our national hero, and others who sacrificed their lives.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>But what is the best thing a 13-year-old girl has done and can do for her country? I am not a mother who is a hero for neither her child nor a father who is a hero for his son. I am just a sophomore student, a girl who knows nothing but to eat, sleep, surf the Internet, watch television and fan-girl over Daniel Padilla. The things I have done for my country so far are to make my parents proud and to give respect. I study to make my parents, as well as my teachers, proud. It is not easy to make a person proud and, at the same time, happy.

</strong></p><p><strong>I gave relief items to the victims of Supertyphoon “Yolanda” before. Yes, it is a big thing, but for me, giving respect is bigger. It is the biggest thing a 13-year-old girl can do and give. Giving respect, for me, is the sister of loving and loving is the root of caring.

</strong></p><p><strong>Giving respect is the best thing I have done for my country and for the people around me.

It will also help me view challenges in a more optimistic way, enabling me to focus on finding solutions, rather than dwelling on the difficulty of a situation.

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>1. Identify your weaknesses.
</strong></p><p>You have to acknowledge what your weaknesses are for you to know what skills and qualities need improvement.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. Face your weaknesses and/or seek help from others.
</strong></p><p>It may seem a cliché, but the best way to improve your skills and qualities is to deal with them firsthand.  For example, your weakness is socializing with people.  What you have to do is to go out with your friends and learn to converse with them confidently, and shying away when the situation becomes uncomfortable for you.  If your weakness is speaking in front of an audience, practice talking in front of a mirror first.  This will help boost your confidence.  Seek help if you must.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>3. Exercise your weaknesses and learn.
</strong></p><p>It is important that you utilize your weak skills and qualities constantly in a productive manner such as exposing yourself to gadgets if you are not confident in using a computer.  Learn the basics by engaging yourself to the “issue”.  Look for ways that you can broaden your knowledge in order to supply for what you lack.
