                                            In the Philippines, more than one third of the urban population lives in informal settlements. More than half of these urban poor families (1.4 million) live in Metro Manila. In theory, theGovernment has addressed the concerns of the urban poor concern through its “Urban Development and Housing Act” (UDHA), which is intended to provide adequate housing at affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities for the slum residents in resettlement areas. However, owing to insufficient capacities at the local level and the lack of appropriate mechanisms to ensure cooperation and consultation in problem solving, the conditions of urban slum residents have only worsened, and they continue to face eviction and demolition from both the government and private landowners.ISSUE: _______________________(social issue, moral issue, economic issue)​</a>

There are more than a 100M people living in the Philippines, thus, ranked as the 12th most populous country in the world.</p><p>The economy of the Philippines largely depend on the remittances from the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) and investing in the homeland.

                        <p>The main economic problem confronting the development of our country in the 21st century is <strong>poverty and unequal distribution of income</strong>. Poverty is when a family has insufficient income to provide the basic needs, including nutritional requirements for everyday living. </p><br /><p><strong>Low investment in Human Resource Development </strong>also affects the economic problem in our country. Some income are less than the minimum requirement; they are underemployed. A large portion of Filipinos are still unemployed, even those who graduated with a degree. It is said that only 1/4 of the Filipinos are able to find good jobs in the country, while the rest find jobs overseas or end up becoming unemployed or underemployed. Low income can lead to hunger for some Filipino families.</p><br /><p>Another problem would be the growth of the country’s population, or the <strong>demographic changes and its economic implications</strong>. A <strong>weak infrastructure</strong> (roads, ports, air transport, railroads) also has an impact in our economy. I think, right now, the government us focusing on the <strong>“Build Build Build” Program</strong> to improve the country’s economy by opening job opportunities, increase income and strengthen the investment climate leading to sustained inclusive growth.</p><br /><br />
