                                            ACTIVITY 1: You be the Judge of it! Though it seems that society is winning in the battle against illegal drug use and abuse, I believe that we are still a long way from declaring victory in the battle. Teenagers are still victimized by drug addiction. Everyone complains? But only a few are some suggestions to stop this terrible and frightening habit. First, the film industry should stop glamorizing drug addiction. Drug addicts and drug pushers should not come out as heroes and saints in films and television programs. They should realize that young people look up to these actors and actresses and what they portray on camera is something that looks cool and good for the young viewers. The government and the actors' guild should come up with a law banning the industry from showing drugs of all forms on television and film. Second, the government should have strict laws and policies on drug trafficking and possession of drugs and their paraphernalia. We should follow our neighboring countries which include death penalties as sanction to drug traffickers. Right now, the Philippines serve as a drop-off point for drugs coming from other countries. Drug Laboratories have been discovered in residential houses and old abandoned factories. Foreign members of syndicates have been caught and charged by authorities. These are proofs that there is a need to review and revise our present laws on drug abuse and trafficking. Third, horrific videos of people dying from drug-related illnesses should be used by the government as advocacy materials for students to see and know the real deal about drug use and abuse. If students will understand the ugly truth about drugs through these advocacies and they will no longer start to take drugs, then the approach will be effective and the experience worthwhile. There are still more ideas I can share with you regarding drug abuse prevention but I think that these three suggestions are more than enough to change the scenario. My parting words are to "think several times before acting out foolishly". The Editor - 1. Questions: What are the ideas of the editor to stop drug use, abuse, and drug trafficking? Summarize these ideas. 2. Do you think the idea of the editor will be effective? Why or why not? 3. Do you have other ideas that might help stop drug use, abuse, and trafficking? Write one idea in each box.​</a>

THE BIRTHDAY SURPRISEToday is my birthday and I am so excited! I wake up early and jump out of bed as quick as a flash. I zoom down the stairs and run into the lounge room where I see a pile of presents in the middle of the floor. There is also an enormous chocolate cake on the kitchen bench. I spend my morning unwrapping presents with my parents. I got a new brand of bike and a really cool school bag. In the afternoon my friends all arrive for my birthday party. There is a clown, a jumping castle and lots of party food. We play lots of fun games like pass the parcel, pin the tail on the donkey and musical chairs. Everyone is laughing and having a great time. At the end of the party I get to hand out party bags to all my friends as they leave. That night my parents cook my favorite food, fried chicken, spaghetti, and salad and then we have left over birthday cake for dessert. I finally fall into bed with an enormous smile on my face. I am so exhausted but I've had the best day ever and I can't wait for my birthday next year!

                                            If the internet has taught us one thing, it’s that everyone has a story – and we love to share them. But storytelling has always been a big part of society and relationships. First Nations people use stories that date back tens of thousands of years to pass history and culture from one generation to the next.At ReachOut, we use stories to talk about real issues and real lives. (Make sure you check out the stories of Jordan and David). We believe in giving young people a place to share their stories, which can help bring people together. There’s lots of positives to sharing your story and, depending on what you’re cool with, many different ways to do it.Why your story mattersEver listened to someone talk about their life and thought ‘Oh, someone else has been through that, too? I thought it was just me!’ Finding similarities with other people helps us live happy and healthy lives. Your life may feel ordinary to you, but it might seem extraordinary to someone else. Every story shared is a chance to make someone feel less alone.Here, Bianca talks about values she hopes to role model for young women across Australia. ​</a>

Write the letter of the correct answer on your paper .Talima Dive Site: Exploring and Searching for Treasures in the Ruins of the Sunken Boat Tele Starting off from Mactan Port, we took a boat to Talima Dive Site. I was so happy because the weather was good. Talima Dive Site is in Olango Island. We spent about 30-45 minutes riding towards Talima. Deep down the dive site we were to expect to see the ruins of the sunken boat. I felt like I was a pirate exploring the underwater looking for treasures in the sunken boat. We slowly descended down the sea water, I saw this pile of wood. At first, wondered what these pieces of wood were doing down here. Later, I realized they were ruins of the sunken boat. The original structure of the boat could not be seen anymore. The remnants were already inhabited by some algae and some coral reefs. These served as an artificial reef which benefited thousands of living organisms in the ocean. My companions and I continued to swim and explore the depths... until I saw the real treasures here in Talima. Then, I saw some patches of corals and there are coral reefs we are to see a lot of fishes. I was saddened at first because I saw only a few fishes. But in a few seconds and to my great surprise, I saw a lot of fishes and many of them were big fishes and other marine creatures. I was really mesmerized by what I saw. It was an incredible sight! Finally, I was done with my wrecking dive. This is one of my memorable dives ever. Never would I have thought I could experience something cool like this. As the day came to its end too, the blazing colors of sunset made the day as beautiful as it was in the morning. 1.

                                            [3] In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." [4] But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. [5] We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. [6] Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality – 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. [7] There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright days of justice emerge Question Stop #2: What do you think would happen if their cry for an equitable and just society would result to physical violence in the process?​</a>

                            9. ACTIVITY 1: You be the Judge of it! Though it seems that society is winning in the battle against illegal drug use and abuse, I believe that we are still a long way from declaring victory in the battle. Teenagers are still victimized by drug addiction. Everyone complains? But only a few are some suggestions to stop this terrible and frightening habit. First, the film industry should stop glamorizing drug addiction. Drug addicts and drug pushers should not come out as heroes and saints in films and television programs. They should realize that young people look up to these actors and actresses and what they portray on camera is something that looks cool and good for the young viewers. The government and the actors' guild should come up with a law banning the industry from showing drugs of all forms on television and film. Second, the government should have strict laws and policies on drug trafficking and possession of drugs and their paraphernalia. We should follow our neighboring countries which include death penalties as sanction to drug traffickers. Right now, the Philippines serve as a drop-off point for drugs coming from other countries. Drug Laboratories have been discovered in residential houses and old abandoned factories. Foreign members of syndicates have been caught and charged by authorities. These are proofs that there is a need to review and revise our present laws on drug abuse and trafficking. Third, horrific videos of people dying from drug-related illnesses should be used by the government as advocacy materials for students to see and know the real deal about drug use and abuse. If students will understand the ugly truth about drugs through these advocacies and they will no longer start to take drugs, then the approach will be effective and the experience worthwhile. There are still more ideas I can share with you regarding drug abuse prevention but I think that these three suggestions are more than enough to change the scenario. My parting words are to "think several times before acting out foolishly". The Editor - 1. Questions: What are the ideas of the editor to stop drug use, abuse, and drug trafficking? Summarize these ideas. 2. Do you think the idea of the editor will be effective? Why or why not? 3. Do you have other ideas that might help stop drug use, abuse, and trafficking? Write one idea in each box.​</h2><br />

                            13. JORDANIAN PLATFORM HELPS IDEAS OF YOUNG INVENTORS, INNOVATORS BECOME REALITYMY REFLECTION: 'I believe', 'I think', 'In my opinion', 'My first reaction was', 'I was especially moved by', 'The author was successful in making me feel',JORDANIAN PLATFORM HELPS IDEAS OF YOUNG INVENTORS, INNOVATORS BECOME REALITYPhilippine Daily Inquirer7 Mar 2022the age of COVID-19, Jordanian mechanical engineer Saliba Taimeh pondered how to deal with one contaminated everyday surface: the handrails of escalators in shopping malls and transport hubs.He came up with a device to sterilize them with ultraviolet rays—and this is where TechWorks stepped in.A wealth of ideas would not have seen the light of day without TechWorks, a Jordanian platform aimed at bringing together youth, ideas and resources to jump-start innovations.Set up in 2018, TechWorks says its mission is “to plug into entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystems” and turn ideas into reality.It is equipped with stateof-the-art technology such as three-dimensional (3D) printers and affiliated with a foundation set up by Crown Prince of Jordan Hussein bin Abdullah.Last year, it attracted about 100 inventors and start-up companies, enabling them to produce prototypes quickly and at low cost.Taimeh, 39, said TechWorks “provided me with every support, back up, advice and guidance” to help perfect the sterilizing device, after 23 attempts over almost two years.German investorHis invention sterilises the handrails of escalators “from all kinds of viruses, such as coronavirus and bacteria,” he said.After contacting several international companies, a German firm specializing in health and safety in public places signed up to manufacture the “Brigid Box.”Weighing in at 7.2 kilograms (almost 16 pounds), it can be installed in less than 15 minutes.Taimeh’s success story is only one of many.High school student Zain Abu Rumman, 18, has developed a tracking device for elderly patients and people with special needs, worn like a watch or around the neck.The “SPS Watch” has a battery that lasts eight days and is resistant to water, heat and breakage.“The device can send alerts to the mobile phone of a family member through a special application in case the person wearing it falls or is hurt, or if he strays from a certain place,” Abu Rumman said.It took him two-and-a-half years to perfect and he has struck a production accord with a Chinese company.Omar Khader, 26, works for “Jazri Studio,” an industrial design company which has devised a “smart” plug to protect children from electric shocks.“TechWorks has advanced equipment, engineers and technicians that help us convert our ideas into successful products,” he said.Other designers, like 32-yearold civil engineer Malik Nour, still have a long and expensive way to go to refine their products.Nour’s brainchild is the “Pikler Triangle,” designed as a safe and environmentally friendly children’s toy.He hopes to attract Swedish furniture giant IKEA to take on his products, which he is already selling over social media to customers in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the label of “Fares World,” named after his child..Creative environmentIsmail Hakki, executive director of TechWorks, said its aim is to provide “a creative environment and all the necessary resources to support and enable young people to transform their projects from a mere idea into a real product.”The doors of the project’s “Fabrication Lab,” or FabLab, are “open to all; we support students, entrepreneurs, and startups,” he said.FabLab also provides services to doctors and hospitals in the fields of facial restoration, digital dentistry, face masks and sterilization.At the request of a doctor, it transformed the chest x-ray of a patient with a malignant tumor close to the heart into a 3D model of the patient’s chest making it easier to operate.FabLab touts many successes, including a “smart home” which allows a mobile phone user to control electrical appliances inside the house from afar by turning on heating or cooling systems and a piano keyboard to help a blind musician play.It plans to open two more branches in Jordan to provide technology training and help for school and university students.​</h2><br />

I zoom down the stairs and run into the lounge room where I see a pile of presents in the middle of the floor. There is also an enormous chocolate cake on the kitchen bench. I spend my morning unwrapping presents with my parents. I got a new brand of bike and a really cool school bag. In the afternoon my friends all arrive for my birthday party. There is a clown, a jumping castle and lots of party food. We play lots of fun games like pass the parcel, pin the tail on the donkey and musical chairs. Everyone is laughing and having a great time. At the end of the party I get to hand out party bags to all my friends as they leave. That night my parents cook my favorite food, fried chicken, spaghetti, and salad and then we have left over birthday cake for dessert. I finally fall into bed with an enormous smile on my face.

                            19. If the internet has taught us one thing, it’s that everyone has a story – and we love to share them. But storytelling has always been a big part of society and relationships. First Nations people use stories that date back tens of thousands of years to pass history and culture from one generation to the next.At ReachOut, we use stories to talk about real issues and real lives. (Make sure you check out the stories of Jordan and David). We believe in giving young people a place to share their stories, which can help bring people together. There’s lots of positives to sharing your story and, depending on what you’re cool with, many different ways to do it.Why your story mattersEver listened to someone talk about their life and thought ‘Oh, someone else has been through that, too? I thought it was just me!’ Finding similarities with other people helps us live happy and healthy lives. Your life may feel ordinary to you, but it might seem extraordinary to someone else. Every story shared is a chance to make someone feel less alone.Here, Bianca talks about values she hopes to role model for young women across Australia. ​</h2><br />

Write the letter of the correct answer on your paper .Talima Dive Site: Exploring and Searching for Treasures in the Ruins of the Sunken Boat Tele Starting off from Mactan Port, we took a boat to Talima Dive Site. I was so happy because the weather was good. Talima Dive Site is in Olango Island. We spent about 30-45 minutes riding towards Talima. Deep down the dive site we were to expect to see the ruins of the sunken boat. I felt like I was a pirate exploring the underwater looking for treasures in the sunken boat. We slowly descended down the sea water, I saw this pile of wood. At first, wondered what these pieces of wood were doing down here. Later, I realized they were ruins of the sunken boat. The original structure of the boat could not be seen anymore. The remnants were already inhabited by some algae and some coral reefs. These served as an artificial reef which benefited thousands of living organisms in the ocean. My companions and I continued to swim and explore the depths... until I saw the real treasures here in Talima. Then, I saw some patches of corals and there are coral reefs we are to see a lot of fishes. I was saddened at first because I saw only a few fishes. But in a few seconds and to my great surprise, I saw a lot of fishes and many of them were big fishes and other marine creatures. I was really mesmerized by what I saw. It was an incredible sight! Finally, I was done with my wrecking dive. This is one of my memorable dives ever. Never would I have thought I could experience something cool like this. As the day came to its end too, the blazing colors of sunset made the day as beautiful as it was in the morning. 1.

                            25. [3] In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." [4] But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. [5] We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. [6] Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality – 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. [7] There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright days of justice emerge Question Stop #2: What do you think would happen if their cry for an equitable and just society would result to physical violence in the process?​</h2><br />
