                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. William Shakespeare</p><p>Ah, The Bard.

George Orwell</p><p>True, Orwell (whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair) isn't everyone's taste, especially those who do not share his views on totalitarianism.</p><p></p><p>But "Animal Farm" and "1984" are exemplary novels that truly get the reader to think more about politics, society and culture.</p><p></p><p>3. J.K. Rowling</p><p>Like her or not, Ms. Rowling has a style of writing that has launched her into the annals of literary history. Her Harry Potter books have won awards not only for their imagination but also for their strong prose.</p><p></p><p>Will she secure a spot in a list of famed authors 100 years from now? Only time will tell - but if you haven't yet journeyed into the world she created, it's time.</p><p></p><p>4. Kurt Vonnegut</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut, who passed away not long ago, penned both short stories and novels, inviting readers into his sci-fi realms with modern-day undertones.</p><p></p><p>"Slaughterhouse-Five" is one of his most internationally known books, though Vonnegut has many other works to offer the reader.</p><p></p><p>5.
