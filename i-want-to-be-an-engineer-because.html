                                            ST. ANDREW COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND SCIENCE: WHO
CAN I TURN TO?
Mrs. Tadino is already 60 years old and is beginning to worry about her
replacement as a president of SACBS. She has three sons and wants one of
them to take over as soon as possible. Although she is sure that whoever she
chooses would gladly accept, she wants to make an intelligent choice.
Gloria’s eldest son Mario is 35 years old, an electronics engineer, and is
working as network administrator of a big communication firm in Makati.
Mario is the immediate superior of five other professional engineers. Mario’s
wife is also an electronics engineers. And is working on the same company as
head of planning department. They have a daughter and a son. Mario is the
most sociable among the three sons of Gloria. He and his wife are very
industrious and are very much contented with their jobs. Their main drawback
is their difficulty balancing their family’s budget.
Gloria’s second son is Glenn who is 33 years old and a professional chemical
engineer. He works as associate engineer in the biggest public utility firm in
Metro Manila. Glenn has ambitions of saving money to buy a house and lot in
Quezon City, a car for him and another for his wife, and enough cash to open
a business when they retire. He is on his way to achieve his goal because he
rarely socializes and he meets people only when it is work-related. His wife is
a professional engineer and is also connected with Glenn’s company as a
supervisor of the IT department.
Gloria’s third son, Vincent, enrolled in a college course in a big university in
Manila just like his two older brothers. Out of 70,000 who took the entrance
examinations, he obtained the tenth highest score. Inspite of that score, he
failed to finish his college course. Unwilling to go back to his province and his
mother, he made himself busy trying to work and educating himself in jobs he
liked.
Vincent worked for two years in a call center as a customer relations agent.
He enrolled in a specialized course in computer. Upon the recommendation of
his Canadian friend, he handled for one year an English class exclusively for
Koreans. His long stay in Manila exposed him for various cultures including
those of the Koreans, as well as his Canadian, Australian and American friends.
For a few years he was also exposed to the culture of the Ilocanos, the Igorots
and the Visayans. For five years he handled classes in Judo and in one
competition he got a gold medal. He bested local and foreign opponents. Later
he established his own small business using the computer as his main
equipment.
Reviewing the credentials of her sons, Gloria seems to have difficulty in
making her final choice. She is contented to know, however that whatever
shortcomings her children may have, they can be remedied by proper training.
1. Give your assessment of each of Gloria’s Son. in terms of
the different skills required of a manager
2. Who do you think is the most desirable successor of
Gloria? Justify your answer. Base your decision on the
various characteristics and skills required of a manager.
3.What do you think are the other acceptable factors that
Gloria may use to come up with the best choice?</a>

Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?

Pedro : Later, Gardo. Read this letter to me first because I left my reading glasses at home.
Gardo : This must have come from Efren.
Pedro : How do you know?
Efren : “... and I want so much to go back home. The only thing that sustains me in my loneliness is the thought that someday, I will be able to help you lift our family from the poverty we have endured for so long. I shall always be grateful to you, Father.”

Sepa : Now, tell me why you were angry when you came home from the fields, Pedro. Do you have a problem?

                                            In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

                            22. ST. ANDREW COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND SCIENCE: WHO
CAN I TURN TO?
Mrs. Tadino is already 60 years old and is beginning to worry about her
replacement as a president of SACBS. She has three sons and wants one of
them to take over as soon as possible. Although she is sure that whoever she
chooses would gladly accept, she wants to make an intelligent choice.
Gloria’s eldest son Mario is 35 years old, an electronics engineer, and is
working as network administrator of a big communication firm in Makati.
Mario is the immediate superior of five other professional engineers. Mario’s
wife is also an electronics engineers. And is working on the same company as
head of planning department. They have a daughter and a son. Mario is the
most sociable among the three sons of Gloria. He and his wife are very
industrious and are very much contented with their jobs. Their main drawback
is their difficulty balancing their family’s budget.
Gloria’s second son is Glenn who is 33 years old and a professional chemical
engineer. He works as associate engineer in the biggest public utility firm in
Metro Manila. Glenn has ambitions of saving money to buy a house and lot in
Quezon City, a car for him and another for his wife, and enough cash to open
a business when they retire. He is on his way to achieve his goal because he
rarely socializes and he meets people only when it is work-related. His wife is
a professional engineer and is also connected with Glenn’s company as a
supervisor of the IT department.
Gloria’s third son, Vincent, enrolled in a college course in a big university in
Manila just like his two older brothers. Out of 70,000 who took the entrance
examinations, he obtained the tenth highest score. Inspite of that score, he
failed to finish his college course. Unwilling to go back to his province and his
mother, he made himself busy trying to work and educating himself in jobs he
liked.
Vincent worked for two years in a call center as a customer relations agent.
He enrolled in a specialized course in computer. Upon the recommendation of
his Canadian friend, he handled for one year an English class exclusively for
Koreans. His long stay in Manila exposed him for various cultures including
those of the Koreans, as well as his Canadian, Australian and American friends.
For a few years he was also exposed to the culture of the Ilocanos, the Igorots
and the Visayans. For five years he handled classes in Judo and in one
competition he got a gold medal. He bested local and foreign opponents. Later
he established his own small business using the computer as his main
equipment.
Reviewing the credentials of her sons, Gloria seems to have difficulty in
making her final choice. She is contented to know, however that whatever
shortcomings her children may have, they can be remedied by proper training.
1. Give your assessment of each of Gloria’s Son. in terms of
the different skills required of a manager
2. Who do you think is the most desirable successor of
Gloria? Justify your answer. Base your decision on the
various characteristics and skills required of a manager.
3.What do you think are the other acceptable factors that
Gloria may use to come up with the best choice?</h2><br />

Sepa : Now, tell me why you were angry when you came home from the fields, Pedro. Do you have a problem?
Pedro : Problem? Oh, no. I don’t have a problem. Let’s just say that there was a little miscommunication earlier. But that has been corrected now.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The letter is from Efren, the son who is studying in Manila, and it contains his message of love and gratitude towards his family, particularly his father who has endured poverty for so long.The eldest son, Gardo, interpreted the letter positively and with a proud tone of voice. He was not jealous of his brother and instead, he seemed to admire Efren's dedication to his studies and his desire to help lift their family from poverty.The mother, Sepa, interpreted the letter with a loving and emotional tone of voice. She expressed her admiration for Efren's character and considered him a good son. While not all mothers may react in the same way, it is common for parents to feel proud and emotional when receiving messages from their children who are away from home.Both interpretations are valid and can be considered close to Efren's intention. The letter expresses Efren's love and gratitude towards his family, as well as his determination to succeed and help his family overcome poverty. It is possible that Efren intended to convey both the positive emotions and the message of hope for a better future that his family can have with his success.Both interpretations are likable, as they show different perspectives and emotions that can arise from reading a letter from a loved one who is far away. However, the interpretation that focuses on Efren's determination to succeed and help his family can be particularly inspiring and hopeful for others who may also be struggling with poverty or other challenges in their lives.<p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>google nyo po para malaman mo</p><br />

                            29. In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

Today they started the of a mall on that big lot. Only those with to enter is allowed. and intelligent engineers and architect are behind the big mall project. I have grown up in that big field with my childhood friends. We ran, rolled. up the mound of soll and told our backs on the green fresh grass. Those days were so We played princess and warriors and and all that come to our sky At night we would gaze at the and waited for shooting stars. We would stay there for as long as we want because the breeze was cold and We would only bid goodbyes when one of my friends' parents would call us to head back home. Soon this former field will hold busy people come and go. Soon heavy or heavy will go back and forth to this land where little feet ran to play. The of this land may fade away but the memories will remain. It may be sad thought, but who knows the mall that they'll build might offer new great moments to live by​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Officially shopping malls are defined as “one or more buildings forming a complex of shops representing merchandisers, with interconnected walkways enabling visitors to walk from unit to unit.”1 Unofficially, they are the heart and soul of communities, the foundation of retail economies, and a social sanctuary for teenagers everywhere. In recent decades, the concept of the shopping mall, which has its origins in the U.S. and became a full-blown modern retail trend there in the post-WWII years, has proliferated across the globe. The five largest malls in the world now reside in Asia. China’s New South China Mall in Dongguan stands at the top of the heap with 2.9 million square meters of space.</p><p></p><p>Despite its ubiquity, the mall as it’s been conceived for the last half century is at a critical inflection point. A storm of global trends are coming together at the same time to cause malls to change the role they play in people’s lives. No longer are they primarily about shopping. Now, when consumers visit malls, they are looking for experiences that go well beyond traditional shopping.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Rose</strong></p><br />
