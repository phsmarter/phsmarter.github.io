Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 health crisis has taken a heavy toll on the daily lives of slum dwellers and those trying to survive on what's left of the informal economy in the Philippines.</p><p>Dambie Reyes Estremos is a dumpster diver living on Magnetic Hill in Los Baños, some 63 kilometers (39 miles) southeast of the capital Manila. She earns her living by selling what she finds among the rubbish at the community-based material recovery facility (MRF) in the barangay, or district, of Timugan.  </p><p></p><p>In normal times, Estremos earns roughly 1,000 pesos (€18, $19.70) per week to support herself and her four children. But since President Rodrigo Duterte declared a Luzon island-wide lockdown on March 16 to curb the coronavirus outbreak, Estremos, like most informal workers in the Philippines, has managed to scavenge next to nothing in the past month.</p><p></p><p>Dumpster divers make up an important part of the Philippines' vast informal economy, but because of the lockdown and strict restrictions on movement and social interaction, they can't sell any of the products they find or trade anything in exchange for goods. So Estremos is collecting as much as she can for the time being and hopes to cash in on all her findings when the enhanced community quarantine is lifted.</p><p></p><p>"What we need are rice, coffee and sugar to fight sleepiness and work all day long," Estremos told DW. She is also calling for facemasks, vitamins and gloves to be distributed among the region's dumpster divers to safeguard their "daily survival." The national government made wearing facemasks mandatory as of April 2.</p><p></p><p>Duterte, who spearheaded the Philippines' war on drugs and is famous for his openly vocal support for the extrajudicial killing of criminals and drug users, said he would order the police and military to "shoot dead" anyone who violates quarantine rules. A 63-year-old farmer in the southern town of Nasipit, who allegedly threatened authorities with a scythe while under the influence of alcohol, was the first reported civilian shot dead by police for not wearing a facemask.</p><p></p><p>Subscribe to Corona Compact — DW's newsletter tracking coronavirus in Asia</p><br />

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</h2><br />
