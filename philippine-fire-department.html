Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus: The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________ Easy Warm-up: ________________________ Fire Starter: ________________________ Audience Reader:_________________________ 2. GOLBAL WARMING: Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects. POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________ EASY WARM-UP:_________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ______________________ FIRE STARTER: ________________________ AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence, POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________ EASY WARM-UP:______________________ FIRE STARTER:________________________ AUDIENCE READER:___________________Dito na lang Po pa answer&lt;3​</a>

If the purpose is to explain, write the letter E. And if the purpose is to persuade, write the letter P. Write your answer on the space provided.1. Participation during earthquake and fire drills are important. This makes everyone informed and familiarized about the things to do if the real happens. This should not be taken taken lightly or make a joke upon. If you are given a chance to participate in an earthquake or fire drill in your school, it is highly advisable to join to ensure your safety.2. The Philippines' unique location along the Pacific Ring of Fire and the "Typhoon Belt" makes it prone to calamities such as typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.3. Super Typhoon Yolanda was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded. On making landfall, Yolanda devastated portions of the Phillipines, particularly in the Visayan region. It is one of the deadliest typhoons on record, killing at least 6,300 people.4. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) is responsible for ensuring the protection and welfare of the people during disadters or emergencies. It is group of various goverment, non-goverment, civil sector, and private organizations established under the Republic Act 10121 of 2010. It is administered by the Office of Civil Defense under the Department of National Defense.5. The wide information dissemination and disaster preparedness did you by the in recent years already showed a noticeable decline in casualaties during a disaster. If this culture of preparedness spreads more to everyone. the goal of "zero casualities" may someday be attained.​</a>

                                            Exercise 3: Identifying the Ultimate Theme Directions: Below is another debate speech which talks of a certain topic or theme Identify the ultimate theme and write it on the space provided Mother Theresa once said, and I quote. "I only feel angry when I see waste, when I see people throwing away things we could use," unquote Friends, Ladies and gentlemen, good day Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmiy regret its creation For this constructive speech. I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in exisung agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Omice of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Developmeni, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation Meanwhile, RA 10121, also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 provides that the (NDRRMC) is the working group convened during times of crises to ensure the protection and welfare of all Filipinos during disasters or emergencies. Included in its functions are securing communication lines during calamities, issuing warning signals, providing emergency transportation, and facilitating evacuation and rescue missions. It also leads in the provision of engineering, health and rehabilitation, public education and auxiliary services such as fire-fighung and post-calamily measures. This is yet to take into account the contribution of non-government organizations such as the Red Cross and various charities. And these ladies and gentlemen are mere duplications under the proposed creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. We have to remember that to create a Department of Disaster Resilience, there's an expectation that it will hold all these responsibilities and not cause blatant redundancy in the government's functions. PRACTICE HYGIENE PROTOCOLS AT ALL TIMES 6 For my second argument, most countries have separate departments for disaster resilience and response, yet they are still successful, efficient, and effective. In Japan, Thailand, and Singapore, an ad hoc committee is created headed by the prime minister, as needed, in response to particular calamities. In fact, in a study titled, Institutional Issues on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management conducted by Sonny Domingo, the Interational Best Practices and Institutional Platforms was presented and such mentioned that the Southeast Asian countries present good cases of DRRM institutional setups thar address similar regional disaster hazards. Underscored in this study is that, the Malaysian government's disaster response is one of the most functional and effecuve and such design is modeled from those of the Philippines and Indonesia. Considering such result, I am wondering why there is such move to create a Department of Disaster Resilience when in reality, the status quo, the design we are using in disaster response is laudable and is recognized interationally? It is our contention therefore in the affirmative side that our resiliency initiatives have been gaining support in all levels of poliucal subdivisions of the government, including communities and outside stakeholders. And when such current momentum is sustained, the coming years would be witness to the monumental transformation of the institutional landscape for DRRM in the country. Hence, we regret the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience in the Philippines.​</a>

                                            6.4-Magnitude Earthquake Shakes Southern Philippines MANILA - A strong 6.4-magnitude earthquake shook the southern Philippines yesterday, sending trightened residents fleeing from buildings, officials and eyewitnesses said. The quake struck oft the coast of the southern town of Manay at 3.16 pm at a depth of 14km, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said in a statement. While there were no immediate reports of serious destruction, the institute said it expects the earthquake to have caused some damage. A lot of people ran from their homes because a lot of items were falling inside," The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) is a service institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) that is principally mandated to mitigate disasters that may arise from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunami and other related geotectonic phenomena. PHIVOLCS science researcher John Deximo said. The Phillippines liles on the so-called Ring of Fire, a vast Pacific Ocean region where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. At least two people were killed and scores injured when a 6.5-magnitude quake struck the central Philippines in July last year. The most recent major quake to hit the Philippines was in 2013, when a 7.1magnitude quake left more than 220 people dead and destroyed historic churches in the central islands1.

                        <p>1. B. Japan, Indonesia, and also the Philippines are located within the pacific ring of fireside.</p><p><strong>The Ring of Fire</strong> is a chain of volcanoes and locations of seismic activity, or earthquakes, that encircles the <strong>Pacific Ocean</strong>'s perimeter. Approximately 90% of all earthquakes occur along <strong>the Ring of Fire</strong>, which also contains 75% of the world's active volcanoes. The Ring of Fire is not a perfect circle.</p><p></p><p>2. D. There will be moving immediately.</p><p>The r<strong>elative movement</strong> of geological features on either side of a fault line is the definition of slip. The slip sense of a fault is the relative movement of the rock on each side of the fault relative to the other.</p><p></p><p>3. A. Scientists checked the country's account.</p><p>They employ many methods to <strong>determine</strong> if a fault is active or inactive, such as examining historical descriptions of an area,<strong> observing</strong> the environment and <strong>conducting</strong> comprehensive research, and analyzing the past and current vibrations created by a fault.</p><p></p><p>4. B. It is where fault cyclones start.</p><p>It is a fracture in <strong>the crust</strong> of the Earth. It develops when rock above an inclined fracture plane moves downward and slides along the rock on the other side of the fracture. Normal faults are frequently found along divergent <strong>plate boundaries</strong>, such as where new crust is forming beneath the ocean. Normal faulting may also produce long, deep valleys.</p><p></p><p>5. C. epicenter</p><p>The focus is the location within the ground where <strong>the earthquake</strong> began, also known as the hypocenter. The<strong> epicenter</strong> is the point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus.</p><p></p><p>6. B. focus</p><p>The earthquakes originate at the interface between tectonic plates. The <strong>focus</strong> is the location within the ground where the earthquake began, also known as the hypocenter. The epicenter is the point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus.</p><p></p><p>7. C. philippine atmospheric, geophysical and astronomical services administration ( PAGASA )</p><p>People for Accountable Governance and Sustainable Action is the acronym for<strong> PAGASA</strong>. The mission of <strong>PAGASA</strong>, one of the attached agencies of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) under its Scientific and Technical Services Institutes, is to "provide protection against natural disasters and use scientific knowledge as an effective tool to ensure the safety, well-being, and economic security of the Philippines."</p><p></p><p>8. D. horizontal movement</p><p>Generally, three types of faults cause earthquakes: normal, strike-slip, and reverse (or thrust). All of these faults are capable of generating tsunamis, although the majority of tsunamis and the greatest ones are caused by<strong> earthquakes </strong>on reverse faults.</p><p></p><p>9. C. stick-slip</p><p>In laboratory studies with geologic materials,<strong> stick-slip</strong> commonly accompanies frictional sliding. Seismic events with a shallow focal depth may represent stick-slip along old or recently created faults.</p><p></p><p>10. A. the wave accelerates and grows tall.</p><p>Tsunamis are only dangerous when they approach land. As <strong>a tsunami </strong>approaches shallow water close to the coast, its speed decreases to 20 to 30 mph. The reduced <strong>wavelength</strong> increased height and intensified currents.</p><p></p><p>11. D. destructive</p><p>VII.<strong> Destructive</strong>. Most individuals are terrified and flee outside. It is difficult for people to stand on the upper floors. Heavy goods and furnishings topple or fall over.</p><p></p><p>12. D. magnitude</p><p><strong>Magnitude </strong>is the most popular metric for measuring the size of an earthquake. It is a measurement of the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the earthquake source and is the same number regardless of your location or the intensity of the shaking.</p><p></p><p>13. C. it is a large wave.</p><p>Tsunamis are enormous<strong> waves </strong>triggered by earthquakes or underwater volcanic eruptions. In the ocean's depths, tsunami waves do not increase in height drastically. As the waves go inland, however, the ocean's depth drops, causing their height to increase.</p><p></p><p>14. B. the rapid release of energy causes a delay in the movement of the bottom.</p><p>When the rough places can no longer hold,<strong> the rapid</strong> release of the accumulated motion occurs, causing an undersea earthquake. This location of horizontal and vertical slippage is known as the epicenter, has the largest magnitude, and causes the most damage.</p><p></p><p>15. A. intensity</p><p><strong>The magnitude</strong> measures the energy generated at the earthquake's epicenter. Seismograph readings are used to calculate magnitude. Intensity measures the magnitude of the earthquake's shaking at a certain site. Effects on individuals, human structures, and the natural environment affect the intensity.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about earthquakes here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/20646571</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ6</strong></p><p></p><br />

Novel Corona Virus: The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort.

Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ______________________ FIRE STARTER: ________________________ AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence, POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________ EASY WARM-UP:______________________ FIRE STARTER:________________________ AUDIENCE READER:___________________Dito na lang Po pa answer&lt;3​</h2><br />

Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ______________________FIRE STARTER: ________________________AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence,POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________EASY WARM-UP:______________________FIRE STARTER:________________________AUDIENCE READER:___________________​</h2><br />

Participation during earthquake and fire drills are important. This makes everyone informed and familiarized about the things to do if the real happens. This should not be taken taken lightly or make a joke upon. If you are given a chance to participate in an earthquake or fire drill in your school, it is highly advisable to join to ensure your safety.2. The Philippines' unique location along the Pacific Ring of Fire and the "Typhoon Belt" makes it prone to calamities such as typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.3. Super Typhoon Yolanda was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded. On making landfall, Yolanda devastated portions of the Phillipines, particularly in the Visayan region. It is one of the deadliest typhoons on record, killing at least 6,300 people.4. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) is responsible for ensuring the protection and welfare of the people during disadters or emergencies. It is group of various goverment, non-goverment, civil sector, and private organizations established under the Republic Act 10121 of 2010. It is administered by the Office of Civil Defense under the Department of National Defense.5.

                            20. Exercise 3: Identifying the Ultimate Theme Directions: Below is another debate speech which talks of a certain topic or theme Identify the ultimate theme and write it on the space provided Mother Theresa once said, and I quote. "I only feel angry when I see waste, when I see people throwing away things we could use," unquote Friends, Ladies and gentlemen, good day Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmiy regret its creation For this constructive speech. I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in exisung agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Omice of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Developmeni, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation Meanwhile, RA 10121, also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 provides that the (NDRRMC) is the working group convened during times of crises to ensure the protection and welfare of all Filipinos during disasters or emergencies. Included in its functions are securing communication lines during calamities, issuing warning signals, providing emergency transportation, and facilitating evacuation and rescue missions. It also leads in the provision of engineering, health and rehabilitation, public education and auxiliary services such as fire-fighung and post-calamily measures. This is yet to take into account the contribution of non-government organizations such as the Red Cross and various charities. And these ladies and gentlemen are mere duplications under the proposed creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. We have to remember that to create a Department of Disaster Resilience, there's an expectation that it will hold all these responsibilities and not cause blatant redundancy in the government's functions. PRACTICE HYGIENE PROTOCOLS AT ALL TIMES 6 For my second argument, most countries have separate departments for disaster resilience and response, yet they are still successful, efficient, and effective. In Japan, Thailand, and Singapore, an ad hoc committee is created headed by the prime minister, as needed, in response to particular calamities. In fact, in a study titled, Institutional Issues on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management conducted by Sonny Domingo, the Interational Best Practices and Institutional Platforms was presented and such mentioned that the Southeast Asian countries present good cases of DRRM institutional setups thar address similar regional disaster hazards. Underscored in this study is that, the Malaysian government's disaster response is one of the most functional and effecuve and such design is modeled from those of the Philippines and Indonesia. Considering such result, I am wondering why there is such move to create a Department of Disaster Resilience when in reality, the status quo, the design we are using in disaster response is laudable and is recognized interationally? It is our contention therefore in the affirmative side that our resiliency initiatives have been gaining support in all levels of poliucal subdivisions of the government, including communities and outside stakeholders. And when such current momentum is sustained, the coming years would be witness to the monumental transformation of the institutional landscape for DRRM in the country. Hence, we regret the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience in the Philippines.​</h2><br />

The quake struck oft the coast of the southern town of Manay at 3.16 pm at a depth of 14km, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said in a statement. While there were no immediate reports of serious destruction, the institute said it expects the earthquake to have caused some damage. A lot of people ran from their homes because a lot of items were falling inside," The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) is a service institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) that is principally mandated to mitigate disasters that may arise from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunami and other related geotectonic phenomena. PHIVOLCS science researcher John Deximo said. The Phillippines liles on the so-called Ring of Fire, a vast Pacific Ocean region where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. At least two people were killed and scores injured when a 6.5-magnitude quake struck the central Philippines in July last year. The most recent major quake to hit the Philippines was in 2013, when a 7.1magnitude quake left more than 220 people dead and destroyed historic churches in the central islands1.
