I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

                            22. ESSAY ABOUT HOW DID OUR SUBJECT ON LIFE AND WORKS OF RIZAL CHANGED YOU? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has had a profound impact on my understanding of Philippine history and my own identity as a Filipino.</p><p></p><p>Before studying Rizal, I had a limited understanding of the events that led to the Philippines becoming a colony of Spain, and the subsequent struggle for independence. Through reading Rizal's writings, such as "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo", I gained a deeper understanding of the injustices and oppression that the Filipino people faced during that time. Rizal's writings not only exposed the injustices and corruption of the Spanish colonial government, but also highlighted the resilience and determination of the Filipino people to fight for their rights.</p><p></p><p>Rizal's writings also helped me to better understand the Philippines' cultural identity. Rizal was a true patriot, and his works were infused with pride in the Philippines' unique culture and history. Through his writings, I learned about the customs, traditions, and beliefs of the Philippines, which helped me to appreciate my own heritage.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Rizal's writings also helped me to develop a sense of social responsibility. Rizal was not only a writer, but also a reformer who advocated for the rights of the Filipino people. His example of standing up for what is right, even in the face of oppression, has inspired me to become more engaged in the issues that affect my community and to take action to make a difference.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has changed me in many ways. It has broadened my understanding of Philippine history and culture, and has inspired me to become more socially responsible. Rizal's legacy continues to be a source of inspiration for all Filipinos, and I am proud to be a part of that legacy.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
