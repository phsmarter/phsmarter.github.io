                                            Mr. Jay Person is the Department Chair of Computer Studies (CS) Department of TABAKOUniversity while Ms. Lee Jane is Mr. Person’s secretary. Tabako University is using a computer system where faculty members are required to personally encode the grades of students, print the grade sheet and submit the signed grade sheet to the department secretary. The department secretary will then submit the grade sheet to the department’s Chair concerned for signature before submitting the hardcopy to the Registrar’s office. Even if the grade sheets are not printed, the same is stored in the computer system and a student concerned will have his grade in the transcript of his records. The printed grade sheet is just a back-up copy of the computer system in case of a system failure.On March 21, 2020 all the grade sheets were already submitted by all CS instructors to Ms. Jane. However, Jane could not submit the same to the registrar’s office because the grade sheet were NOT signed by Mr. Person who attended an intensive Java Boot Camp Seminar being held in Mindanao. Without the knowledge of Mr. Person, Ms. Jane forged the signature of Mr. Person and personally signed on the grade sheet. Jane told herself, “if I will NOT do it, we will be late in the submission of grade sheets, anyway Sir Jay’s signature is only a formal requirement.”​</a>

                            9. Mr. Jay Person is the Department Chair of Computer Studies (CS) Department of TABAKOUniversity while Ms. Lee Jane is Mr. Person’s secretary. Tabako University is using a computer system where faculty members are required to personally encode the grades of students, print the grade sheet and submit the signed grade sheet to the department secretary. The department secretary will then submit the grade sheet to the department’s Chair concerned for signature before submitting the hardcopy to the Registrar’s office. Even if the grade sheets are not printed, the same is stored in the computer system and a student concerned will have his grade in the transcript of his records. The printed grade sheet is just a back-up copy of the computer system in case of a system failure.On March 21, 2020 all the grade sheets were already submitted by all CS instructors to Ms. Jane. However, Jane could not submit the same to the registrar’s office because the grade sheet were NOT signed by Mr. Person who attended an intensive Java Boot Camp Seminar being held in Mindanao. Without the knowledge of Mr. Person, Ms. Jane forged the signature of Mr. Person and personally signed on the grade sheet. Jane told herself, “if I will NOT do it, we will be late in the submission of grade sheets, anyway Sir Jay’s signature is only a formal requirement.”​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The chart that Mrs. De Chavez used to explain the water cycle is an example of a non-print material. Non-print materials are instructional materials that are not in written or printed form, but are used to convey information visually or through other means. Examples of non-print materials include charts, graphs, diagrams, models, videos, and audio recordings.</p><p></p><p>In the case of Mrs. De Chavez, the chart she used to explain the water cycle likely contained visual representations of the different stages of the cycle, such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. These visuals can help students better understand the concept of the water cycle and how water moves through the environment.</p><p></p><p>Non-print materials like charts are often used in educational settings to enhance teaching and learning.
