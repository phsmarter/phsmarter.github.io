                        <p>Social media toxicity has become a pervasive issue in our society. While social media has provided us with a platform to connect, share, and learn, it has also created a breeding ground for bullying, cyberbullying, and harassment. Unfortunately, this type of negative behavior has become commonplace on social media.</p><p>However, there are ways to combat the toxicity on social media. Taking a stand against this type of behavior is the first step. Speak up when you see someone being mistreated and make sure to report offensive comments and posts. Also, remember to be mindful of your own words and actions. Don't engage in any type of negativity, no matter how small. Finally, try to bring more positivity to social media. Spread kindness, share uplifting messages, and support others. With these steps, we can make a difference and create a more positive social media environment.</p><br />
