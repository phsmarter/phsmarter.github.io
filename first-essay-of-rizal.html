                                            According to Huxley, an essay is a piece of writing that gives an author's own argument. It
is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse". Aldous
Huxley, a leading essayist, says that the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about
almost anything. He suggests that essays can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of
reference. First is the personal and the autobiographical (i.e., the essayists write fragments of reflective
autobiography and look at the world through anecdotes and descriptions). Second is the objective, the
factual, and the concrete particular (i.e., the essayists do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their
attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Essayists pass judgment and draw
general conclusions from the presentation relevant data. Third, is the abstract-universal (i.e., the
essayists do their work in the world of high abstractions). They are never personal and they seldom
mention the particular facts of experience. The most satisfying essays make the best not of one, not of
two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.
Apply Huxley’s analysis to the essays of Rizal, as a whole, and briefly write about your insights in an
essay.</a>

BAYANI
They are the heroes of the Philippines
Many years ago
He did it indefinitely
Such a good show
Lapu-lapu is the first hero
He defeated opponents fiercely
Wants to occupy and oppress
They failed and were defeated
Jose Rizal is the national hero
His brains used to be good
Help the people from being oppressed
In his hometown he was made a servant
Andres Bonifacio father of
KatipunanFought for freedom
Not afraid of foreigners
Not betrayed until death
Apolinario Mabini the great cripple
Handicapped but smart
In the rebellion he was a counselor
Even sick do not beat
Freedom is what we want to achieve
Until the world shrinks
And life became the substitute
In the hands of the cruel foreigner.</a>

                            3. According to Huxley, an essay is a piece of writing that gives an author's own argument. It
is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse". Aldous
Huxley, a leading essayist, says that the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about
almost anything. He suggests that essays can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of
reference. First is the personal and the autobiographical (i.e., the essayists write fragments of reflective
autobiography and look at the world through anecdotes and descriptions). Second is the objective, the
factual, and the concrete particular (i.e., the essayists do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their
attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Essayists pass judgment and draw
general conclusions from the presentation relevant data. Third, is the abstract-universal (i.e., the
essayists do their work in the world of high abstractions). They are never personal and they seldom
mention the particular facts of experience. The most satisfying essays make the best not of one, not of
two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.
Apply Huxley’s analysis to the essays of Rizal, as a whole, and briefly write about your insights in an
essay.</h2><br />

BAYANI
They are the heroes of the Philippines
Many years ago
He did it indefinitely
Such a good show
Lapu-lapu is the first hero
He defeated opponents fiercely
Wants to occupy and oppress
They failed and were defeated
Jose Rizal is the national hero
His brains used to be good
Help the people from being oppressed
In his hometown he was made a servant
Andres Bonifacio father of
KatipunanFought for freedom
Not afraid of foreigners
Not betrayed until death
Apolinario Mabini the great cripple
Handicapped but smart
In the rebellion he was a counselor
Even sick do not beat
Freedom is what we want to achieve
Until the world shrinks
And life became the substitute
In the hands of the cruel foreigner.</h2><br />
