                            1. what are the 4 marks of the church. explain each mark​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The four marks of the Church are not characteristics that the Church creates or develops or learns. They are qualities that Jesus Christ shares with his Church through the Holy Spirit. The four marks of the Church are that it is one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO FAVOR LANG THANK YOU </p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS </p><p></p><p></p><p>1.The Church Is One</p><p>Just as God is one in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, so also is the Church one. The founder of the Church is Jesus Christ, who brought us back to God and made us into the family of God. The Church is one in the Holy Spirit, who dwells in those who believe.</p><p></p><p>2.The Church Is Holy</p><p>The Church is holy because the Church lives in union with Jesus Christ, the source of holiness. Through the Holy Spirit the Church leads others to holiness. The holiness of the Church is seen in the love that the members of the Church have toward one another and the many sacrifices they make for the sake of the world.</p><p></p><p>3.The Church Is Catholic</p><p>Catholic means “universal.” The Church is universal in two ways. First, the Church is catholic because all baptized people are part of the Church and the Church possesses the means of salvation. Second, the mission of the Church is universal because the Church has been sent to proclaim Christ to the entire human race.</p><p></p><p>4.The Church Is Apostolic</p><p>The Church traces its tradition directly from the apostles; therefore, the Church is considered apostolic. With the Holy Spirit the Church preserves and continues the teaching of the apostles. The pope and bishops are the successors of the apostles.</p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>1. The Four Marks of the Church, also known as the Attributes of the Church, is a term describing four distinctive adjectives—"One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic"—of traditional Christian ecclesiology as expressed in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed completed at the First Council of Constantinople in AD 381</p><p></p><p>2. The creed that is recited in Mass on a weekly basis will usually be the Nicene Creed. Within the creed, the nature of the Church is made clear in the final verse - I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. The words one, holy, catholic and apostolic are often called the four marks of the Church.</p><p></p><p>3. Three marks are usually enumerated: the preaching of the Word, the administration of the sacraments, and church discipline.</p><p></p><p>4. Churches Militant, Penitent, and Triumphant.</p><p></p><p>5. The Holy Spirit enables Christian life by dwelling in the individual believers and enables them to live a righteous and faithful life.

These marks include:</p><p></p><p>1. One: The Church is one in its mission, worship, and doctrine, despite the diversity of its members and traditions.</p><p></p><p>2. Holy: The Church is holy because it is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit and leads people to holiness through sacraments and teachings.</p><p></p><p>3. Catholic: The Church is Catholic, meaning universal, because it encompasses all people from all nations and cultures and offers salvation to all.</p><p></p><p>4. Apostolic: The Church is apostolic because it is founded on the apostles and continues to be guided by their successors, the bishops.</p><p></p><p>By keeping these marks in mind, Catholics can better understand and appreciate the universality and unity of the Church, as well as its mission to bring people to holiness and salvation.</p><br />

</p><p>Definition of Marriage –
</p><p>Marriage in the Catholic Church, also called matrimony, is the "covenant by which a 
</p><p>man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and 
</p><p>which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and 
</p><p>education of offspring", and which "has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a 
</p><p>sacrament between the baptized." Code of Canon Law
</p><p>Basically - (Procreation) Creation of children, education of children and the common fidelity of 
</p><p>the spouses. Marriage is the generation of new life, thus it has to be between a man and a 
</p><p>woman. 
</p><p>Form and Matter are the same
</p><p>Questions
</p><p>1. N. and N. have you come here to enter into Marriage without coercion, freely and 
</p><p>wholeheartedly?
</p><p>2. Are you prepared, as you follow the path of Marriage, to love and honor each other for as 
</p><p>long as you both shall live?
</p><p>3. Are you prepared to accept children lovingly from God and to bring them up according to 
</p><p>the law of Christ and his Church?
</p><p>Consent 
</p><p>Groom – I, n. take you, n, to be my wife. I promise to be faithful to you in good times and in 
</p><p>bad, in sickness and in health, to love you and to honor you all the days of my life.
</p><p>Bride – I, n. take you, n, to be my husband. I promise to be faithful to you in good times and in 
</p><p>bad, in sickness and in health, to love you and to honor you all the days of my life.
</p><p>Minimum Age Requirement:
</p><p>The Church states that the Man must be at least 16 years old and the woman must be at 
</p><p>least 14 years old. Local Law of age requirements must also be fulfilled</p><p></p><p>As Catholics, we long that God will bless the couple and their marriage. Thus, they 
</p><p>come to God’s home to have the Church’s minister bless the marriage. The couple 
</p><p>minister to one other through their consent and vows, and the minister, acting in the 
</p><p>person of Christ bless’ the marriage. Think of any Disney Wedding, where did they 
</p><p>take place? It was in the palace, in the Queens chamber, the Royal Chamber, which 
</p><p>is considered to be the most sacred place in the palace and the kingdom. So, the 
</p><p>wedding takes place in the most sacred of all places. Yes, God is everywhere, but 
</p><p>there is something special about coming to a sacred place. 
</p><p>What about divorce?
</p><p>In the vows that the couple makes before God, they are considered to be sacred, and 
</p><p>taken seriously, till death do us part. Now, there are circumstances that come up, that might 
</p><p>warrant a divorce or separation, such as abuse, the person is not who they said they were, the 
</p><p>person becomes violent. When one is separated, one is not considered outside the Church, or in 
</p><p>sin. 
</p><p>What about remarriage?
</p><p>Remarriage is permitted if the spouse dies. 
</p><p>Also, remarriage is possible if one gets an annulment or declaration of nullity which 
</p><p>states that the marriage never took place as marriage is intended. This process goes through the 
</p><p>Church’s Tribunal or Church court for another name. This process helps bringing healing to the 
</p><p>one who was previously married and makes sure that they are suitable to enter into marriage.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
