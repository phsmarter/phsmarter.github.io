Generally, self-concept embodies the answer to "Who am I?". Self-concept is distinguishable from self-awareness, which refers to the extent to which self-knowledge is defined, consistent, and currently applicable to one's attitudes and dispositionsSelf-concept is generally thought of as our individual perceptions of our behavior, abilities, and unique characteristics—a mental picture of who you are as a person. 1﻿ For example, beliefs such as "I am a good friend" or "I am a kind person" are part of an overall self-concept.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hi, my name is Leona. I'm currently 22 years old and I'm studying psychology right now. In the last two weeks, I've been taught how to treat a patient in psychotherapy through the lens of three different theories of psychodynamics: Freudian, Behaviorist, and Cognitive. It's been a very eye-opening experience that has helped me understand a lot more about myself and other people around me!</p><p></p><p>I've also recently found out that my uncle was diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this year. It's very difficult to cope with the idea that he's dying—especially because I'm still very young and this is my first experience witnessing death. However, I feel like a lot of my family members are trying to keep everything "positive" and "upbeat" now. My uncle doesn't seem to have his spirits as high as we would've liked, but it feels like there's a sort of unspoken rule that we shouldn't bring up anything about the fact that he might die soon.</p><p></p><p>I've noticed that my family and other relatives are especially afraid of talking about death directly. They don't like to bring up the subject, even if it's to talk about something positive, such as life insurance policies.</p><br />

My best friend is someone who has been with me throughgon  of life’s ups and downs. She is like a sister to me and I am grateful to have her in my life.</p><p></p><p>I met my best friend in high school. We were both in the same class, but we didn’t really talk to each other until one day when we were both assigned to work on a group project together. From that point on, we hit it off and became inseparable.</p><p></p><p>What I love most about my best friend is that she is always there for me. No matter what happens, I know that I can count on her to be there to listen, give advice and offer a shoulder to cry on. She always knows the right thing to say and has a way of making me feel better when I’m feeling down.</p><p></p><p>Another thing that I appreciate about my best friend is her honesty. She never sugarcoats anything and always tells me the truth even if it’s something I don’t want to hear. Her honesty has helped me grow as a person and I am grateful for that.</p><p></p><p>We have so many great memories together from road trips, sleepovers, concerts and even just hanging out at home. No matter what we do, we always have a great time together.</p><p></p><p>I believe that a true best friend is someone who is there for you through thick and thin, someone who you can trust and confide in, someone who is honest with you and someone who you have great memories with. My best friend embodies all of these qualities and more. She is an amazing person and I am grateful to have her in my life.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, having a best friend is one of the greatest gifts in life. They are there to support you, make you laugh and cry with you. My best friend is someone who has touched my life in so many ways and I am grateful for her every day.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Art transcends all barriers and boundaries. With art there is no race, religion, age or colour; just the joy of rhythm. A joy that melds diversities and has the power to bring people together in one voice. The current Covid-19 pandemic is enough to daunt even the strongest, but dance with its unique power is already serving as a useful vehicle of hope and positivity to bring relief into a world that could be perceived as struggling under a huge cloud of uncertainty and gloom.Dating back to history and ancient civilisations, dance has always been used in various ways, be it prayer, celebration or war. Today we are in a war of a different kind. The whole world is fighting one common enemy, the coronavirus. In times like these where people are forced to insulate themselves, dance and music are slowly becoming a common way to bring people together and cheer them on. The internet is full of free concerts, and celebrated dancers and artists are beaming out art from their living rooms, making the experience so much more real and personal. Just what the doctor ordered - to spread hope and reassurance. A lot of performances are also being shared on the internet as a way of keeping people engaged and positive. Aside from this, individuals and groups are sharing all kinds of dances.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It is amazing what the virtual world has done for us globally in making the world a smaller place. As the pandemic has pressed on, people have found innovative ways to come together. There have been dances of gratitude, dances with masks, dances that connect, as a way of encouraging people to dance their blues away.</p><p></p><p>Students who enrol in our dance classes, do so for various reasons. Many want to make a career in dance, some want to tone their bodies, while others want to get rid of the inhibitions of social dancing and just have fun. But one quest binds every student and that is that dance frees the mind and soul. According to a Harvard Health Review article, exercise, as in dance, can not only “promote chemical balance” but also “deepen the mind-body connection.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>I have seen students over the years feel relaxed and happy after a dance session. This is because during the class, stress levels dive and the endorphins take over and this makes the mind calm. It can be a hugely spiritual experience. When one dances, one connects to the music and to the self. In that one moment, you become one with yourself and the universe. It is no wonder that throughout history so many cultures have used dance as a way of meditation and connecting with the almighty. At a time like this, dance can also be seen as a way to meditate. In a way, dancing is many thing rolled in one - cheerleader, doctor, priest, entertainer and physical trainer.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The best part... everyone is exposed to some form of dance or the other, so taking the first step is just a small decision away. A decision to stay positive, happy and healthy and share that with others. You could take it on as a family drill or just dance by yourself in the safety of your own space. The key is to express yourself and let your spirit free. No need for perfection. Lock yourself into a room, or put on your headphones, play your favourite track and let your body flow. Just in letting go, you are in tune with yourself and that is perfection enough. Forget about being in step or whether you match up to anyone else- today you just dance for you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You dance to celebrate life and the gift of being born. You dance with gratitude, love and trust knowing all will soon be well. The world is dealing with something larger than life and while we take the time to pause and think of all those suffering, we must also take the time to celebrate ourselves and others and turn this world of gloom and doom into one of hope, love and togetherness. Today the air is cleaner, the sky is bluer, the trees are greener and life all around is dancing a dance of celebration. What better time to dance than now?</p><p></p><p>Ashley Lobo is the founder and artistic director of The Danceworx Academy and Navdhara India Dance Theatre.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Grandparents</p><p>I was lucky enough to grow up in my grandparent’s house. Our family lived with my grandparents since I was little. As my paternal grandfather passed away when I was very young, I only remember a few memories of him. One thing I surely remember is he used to brush his teeth twice daily without fail. I adopted this habit and ever since I have been doing the same.</p><p></p><p>My maternal grandparents have been my true systems of support. I am lucky enough to have grown up around such inspirational people. My grandfather was a principal of a college, so he always emphasized the importance of education. He helped us with our homework when my parents were not available. I spent my vacations at their place as I enjoyed living with them.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, my grandparents always embraced me with open arms. They used to wait for every holiday for our arrival. My grandmother made delicious pickles and meals which we relished greatly. She taught me a few recipes too and tips and tricks that are very useful even today. I simply adore my grandparents for instilling good values in me and my parents and for giving us a safe space to grow up in.</p><br />

Every family has those things, acts and values that they hold in high esteem and they cherish so much. These vales have become a part of them: most times, it is what distinguishes the traits in each family and in some ways it makes or mars the future of the family members. Same applies to my family, we have some set values that has become a part of us and it has made my life a lot better because I have become a better person who is not only valuable to himself but also to the society at large.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>communication, we most often focus on how we exchange information using words. While verbal communication is important, humans relied on nonverbal communication for thousands of years before we developed the capability to communicate with words. Nonverbal communication is a process of generating meaning using behavior other than words. Rather than thinking of nonverbal communication as the opposite of or as separate from verbal communication, it’s more accurate to view them as operating side by side—as part of the same system.Yet, as part of the same system, they still have important differences, including how the brain processes them. For instance, nonverbal communication is typically governed by the right side of the brain and verbal, the left.Peter A. Andersen, Nonverbal Communication: Forms and Functions (Mountain View, CA: Mayfield, 1999), 2–8. This hemispheric distinction has been clearly evidenced, as people who suffer trauma to the right side of their brain lose the ability to recognize facial expressions but can still process verbal communication.Conversely, people whose left hemisphere of the brain is damaged lose the ability to speak, read, and understand language. Interestingly, a person with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain who loses the ability to speak can often still sing since the creation, but not the reading, of music is governed by the right brain. The content and composition of verbal and nonverbal communication also differs. In terms of content, nonverbal communication tends to do the work of communicating emotions more than verbal. In terms of composition, although there are rules of grammar that structure our verbal communication, no such official guides govern our use of nonverbal signals.Likewise, there aren’t dictionaries and thesauruses of nonverbal communication like there are with verbal symbols. Finally, whereas we humans are unique in our capacity to abstract and transcend space and time using verbal symbols, we are not the only creatures that engage in nonverbal communication.Owen Hargie, Skilled Interpersonal Interaction: Research, Theory, and Practice, 5th ed. (London: Routledge, 2011), 49. These are just some of the characteristics that differentiate verbal communication from nonverbal, and in the remainder of this chapter we will discuss in more detail the principles, functions, and types of nonverbal communication and conclude with some guidance on how to improve our nonverbal communication competence.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>belle</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Existentialism is a catch-all term for those philosophers who consider the nature of the human condition as a key philosophical problem and who share the view that this problem is best addressed through ontology. This very broad definition will be clarified by discussing seven key themes that existentialist thinkers address. Those philosophers considered existentialists are mostly from the continent of Europe, and date from the 19th and 20th centuries. Outside philosophy, the existentialist movement is probably the most well-known philosophical movement, and at least two of its members are among the most famous philosophical personalities and widely read philosophical authors. It has certainly had considerable influence outside philosophy, for example on psychological theory and on the arts. Within philosophy, though, it is safe to say that this loose movement considered as a whole has not had a great impact, although individuals or ideas counted within it remain important. Moreover, most of the philosophers conventionally grouped under this heading either never used, or actively disavowed, the term ‘existentialist’. Even Sartre himself once said: “Existentialism? I don’t know what that is.” So, there is a case to be made that the term – insofar as it leads us to ignore what is distinctive about philosophical positions and to conflate together significantly different ideas – does more harm than good.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Example of a Stressful Incident and Its Stages of Stress Response</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, I had a major project due for one of my courses in college. I had spent weeks researching and writing the paper, but as the deadline approached, I began to feel overwhelmed and anxious. On the day the paper was due, my computer crashed, and I lost all my progress. This incident triggered the three stages of the stress response: the alarm stage, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage.</p><p></p><p>The alarm stage is the first stage of the stress response. It is also known as the fight or flight response. When I realized that I had lost all my progress on the paper, my body went into a state of shock. My heart rate increased, and I began to sweat. My brain released hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which prepared me to either fight the problem or run away from it.</p><p></p><p>The resistance stage is the second stage of the stress response. It occurs when the stressor persists, and the body continues to respond to it. In my case, I had to decide what to do next. I could either give up on the project or start over. I chose to start over, which meant working long hours and sacrificing sleep and other activities. This stage is characterized by continued release of stress hormones, which can lead to physical and mental exhaustion if prolonged.</p><p></p><p>The exhaustion stage is the third and final stage of the stress response. It occurs when the body can no longer cope with the stressor, and it begins to break down. In my case, after weeks of stress and anxiety, I finally completed the project. However, I was physically and mentally exhausted. I had trouble sleeping, and I experienced headaches and other physical symptoms. This stage can lead to long-term health problems if not managed properly.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the three stages of the stress response – alarm, resistance, and exhaustion – are a natural and normal response to stressful situations. However, prolonged exposure to stress can lead to physical and mental health problems. In my case, the stress of the project caused me to experience physical symptoms and exhaustion. It is important to be aware of the stages of stress response and to take steps to manage stress effectively, such as through exercise, relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends or mental health professionals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>note: follow and mark me Brainliest for more answers </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
