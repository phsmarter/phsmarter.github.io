She is only 10 years old. I am now in Grade 6, she, on the other hand is in Grade 4. My hobbies are different from her. I like playing badminton and volleyball, whereas, my sister Mhel loves drawing and painting. She also loves dogs. In fact, she volunteers to take care of our neighbor's dog if they are not home. I, in contrast, am terrified of dogs. I like having an aquarium instead. We both enjoy being in the outdoors. We enjoy hiking in the woods of Camp John Hay and camping as well. Although my sister and I are very different, we do love to be together. We grew up together, we always have fun and laugh a lot​</a>
