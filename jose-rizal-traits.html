Suddenly, out of nowhere a great colorful bird appeared that flew between the vast sky and the boundless sea. The bird kept on flying and soon got tired. It searched for a place to land on but there was none. The bird had a plan. The bird created a word of war between the Sea and sky of which of the two was the strongest. The Sky got angry and proved his strength. I threw thunderbolts at the Sea. In an instant, the Sea sent huge waves against the Sky. The war lasted for a long time. However, the Sky felt that it was losing in the war and asked help from the great bird. So, the bird dove into the deep water of the sea and got big pieces of rocks from the ocean floor. The bird gave these pieces of earth up to the sky, and then flung it down on the raging Sea. The Sea quieted. And thus, the Philippine archipelago was born. At last, the great bird was able to find place to rest in one of these islands. -Adapted- Tiongson, EL.(2008). Journeys 4.$ta. Ana, Manila. Vicarish Publication &amp; Trading, Inc B.

Biag ni Lam-ang by Pedro Bucaneg
Don Juan and his wife Namongan lived in Nalbuan, now part of La Union in the northern part of the Philippines. They had a son named Lam-ang. Before Lam-ang was born, Don Juan went to the mountains in order to punish a group of their Igorot enemies. While he was away, his son Lam-ang was born. It took four people to help Namongan give birth. As soon as the baby boy popped out, he spoke and asked that he be given the name Lam-ang. He also chose his godparents and asked where his father was.
After nine months of waiting for his father to return, Lam-ang decided he would go look for him. Namongan thought  Lam-ang was up to the challenge but she was sad to let him go.
During his exhausting journey, he decided to rest for awhile. He fell asleep and had a dream about his father’s head being stuck on a pole by the Igorot. Lam-ang was furious when he learned what had happened to his father. He rushed to their village and killed them all, except for one whom he let go so that he could tell other people about Lam-ang’s greatness.
Upon returning to Nalbuan in triumph, he was bathed by women in the Amburayan river. All the fish died because of the dirt and odor from Lam-ang’s body.
There was a young woman named Ines Kannoyan whom Lam-ang wanted to woo.  She lived in Calanutian and he brought along his white rooster and gray dog to visit her. On the way, Lam-ang met his enemy Sumarang, another suitor of Ines whom he fought and readily defeated.
Lam-ang found the house of Ines surrounded by  many suitors all of whom were trying to catch her attention.  He had his rooster crow, which caused a nearby house to fall.  This made Ines look out. He had his dog bark and in an instant the fallen house rose up again. The girl’s parents witnessed this and called for him. The rooster expressed the love of Lam-ang. The parents agreed to a marriage with their daughter if Lam-ang would give them a dowry valued at double their wealth. Lam-ang had no problem fulfilling this condition and he and Ines were married.
It was a tradition to have a newly married man swim in the river for the rarang fish. Unfortunately, Lam-ang dove straight into the mouth of the water monster Berkakan. Ines had Marcos get his bones, which she covered with a piece of cloth. His rooster crowed and his dog barked and slowly the bones started to move. Back alive, Lam-ang and his wife lived happily ever after with his white rooster and gray dog.

Suddenly, out of nowhere a great colorful bird appeared that flew between the vast sky and the boundless sea. The bird kept on flying and soon got tired. It searched for a place to land on but there was none. The bird had a plan. The bird created a word of war between the Sea and sky of which of the two was the strongest. The Sky got angry and proved his strength. I threw thunderbolts at the Sea. In an instant, the Sea sent huge waves against the Sky. The war lasted for a long time. However, the Sky felt that it was losing in the war and asked help from the great bird. So, the bird dove into the deep water of the sea and got big pieces of rocks from the ocean floor. The bird gave these pieces of earth up to the sky, and then flung it down on the raging Sea. The Sea quieted. And thus, the Philippine archipelago was born. At last, the great bird was able to find place to rest in one of these islands. -Adapted- Tiongson, EL.(2008). Journeys 4.$ta. Ana, Manila. Vicarish Publication &amp; Trading, Inc B.

Biag ni Lam-ang by Pedro Bucaneg
Don Juan and his wife Namongan lived in Nalbuan, now part of La Union in the northern part of the Philippines. They had a son named Lam-ang. Before Lam-ang was born, Don Juan went to the mountains in order to punish a group of their Igorot enemies. While he was away, his son Lam-ang was born. It took four people to help Namongan give birth. As soon as the baby boy popped out, he spoke and asked that he be given the name Lam-ang. He also chose his godparents and asked where his father was.
After nine months of waiting for his father to return, Lam-ang decided he would go look for him. Namongan thought  Lam-ang was up to the challenge but she was sad to let him go.
During his exhausting journey, he decided to rest for awhile. He fell asleep and had a dream about his father’s head being stuck on a pole by the Igorot. Lam-ang was furious when he learned what had happened to his father. He rushed to their village and killed them all, except for one whom he let go so that he could tell other people about Lam-ang’s greatness.
Upon returning to Nalbuan in triumph, he was bathed by women in the Amburayan river. All the fish died because of the dirt and odor from Lam-ang’s body.
There was a young woman named Ines Kannoyan whom Lam-ang wanted to woo.  She lived in Calanutian and he brought along his white rooster and gray dog to visit her. On the way, Lam-ang met his enemy Sumarang, another suitor of Ines whom he fought and readily defeated.
Lam-ang found the house of Ines surrounded by  many suitors all of whom were trying to catch her attention.  He had his rooster crow, which caused a nearby house to fall.  This made Ines look out. He had his dog bark and in an instant the fallen house rose up again. The girl’s parents witnessed this and called for him. The rooster expressed the love of Lam-ang. The parents agreed to a marriage with their daughter if Lam-ang would give them a dowry valued at double their wealth. Lam-ang had no problem fulfilling this condition and he and Ines were married.
It was a tradition to have a newly married man swim in the river for the rarang fish. Unfortunately, Lam-ang dove straight into the mouth of the water monster Berkakan. Ines had Marcos get his bones, which she covered with a piece of cloth. His rooster crowed and his dog barked and slowly the bones started to move. Back alive, Lam-ang and his wife lived happily ever after with his white rooster and gray dog.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mahatma Gandhi</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The person who I believe could be considered a bayani, based on our definition of a bayani as a selfless and courageous individual who works towards the betterment of their community and country, is Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi was a political and spiritual leader in India who is best known for his non-violent resistance movement against British rule.</p><p></p><p>Gandhi was a deeply moral and compassionate person who believed in the power of non-violent resistance as a means of achieving social and political change. He was willing to suffer and endure personal sacrifice in order to bring about justice and equality for all people, regardless of their religion or social status.</p><p></p><p>Gandhi's efforts to promote non-violent resistance and civil disobedience inspired people around the world, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. His philosophy of satyagraha, which means "truth force" or "soul force," emphasizes the power of love and non-violent action to bring about social change.</p><p></p><p>In addition to his work as a political leader, Gandhi was also a strong advocate for social justice and equality.
