Many times when I rounded the turn for the last lap of a race, my complaining muscles want to downshift and idle to finish. My mind, however, presses the pedal to the floor and yells, "Faster!" The moment I touched the wall my muscles relax; the pain subsides. I am pleased to have passed the point of conflict.​</a>
