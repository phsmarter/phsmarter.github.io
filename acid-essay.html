                                            pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Carboxylic acids (RCO2H) are one of nature's most common organic compounds. An acyl group bonded to an electronegative atom or substituent that acts as a leaving group in substitution reactions is a typical structural feature. The active group replaces the -OH group of the acid in acid halides (RCOX), acid anhydrides (RCO2COR'), amides (RCONH2), esters (RCO2R), and nitriles (R-C=N). Since carboxylate anions are more stable than alkoxide ions, carboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids (e.g. HCl) but more acidic than alcohols. Their pKa is typically around 5. This is because the negative charge in a carboxylate ion is shared by both oxygen atoms, stabilizing them in resonance hybrid systems, while the negative charge in an alkoxide is localized in one oxygen atom. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group favors dissociation and increased acidity because acid dissociation is an equilibrium mechanism. For example, chloracetic acid, an acid halide, is 75 times stronger than acetic acid, and dichloracetic acid is 3000 times stronger.</p><p></p><p>The chemistry of all carboxylic acid derivatives is similar, and the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction is the most common reaction form. This is accomplished by adding a nucleophilic to the acid derivative's polar carbonyl group. Following that, the departing party is expelled. Air, alcohols, amines, hydride ions, and Grignard reagents are the most important nucleophiles in these reactions (RMgX). Since nitriles can undergo nucleophilic additions to the polar CN triple bond in the same way as carbonyl compounds can, they are classified as carboxylic acid derivatives. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, their reduction to primary amines, and their reactions with Grignard reagents to yield ketones are the most important reactions.</p><p></p><p>#Carryonlearning</p><p></p><br />

                        Carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids are organic molecules found in every living<br />organism. These macromolecules are large carbon based structures. The macromolecules are assembled by joining several smaller units, called monomers, together through a chemical reaction called dehydration synthesis. The resulting polymer can be disassembled through the complimentary process called hydrolysis.<br />Carbohydrates are used by living organisms as an important source of energy. Examples of carbohydrates include glucose, fructose, sucrose, galactose, ribose, deoxyribose, cellulose and chitin.<br />Lipids (Fats) Lipids are energy rich storage molecules. One gram of lipid stores twice as much energy as one gram of a carbohydrate.<br />Proteins are composed of amino acids. Proteins serve as the major building blocks of organisms. Proteins are large complex molecules that combine to form various components of living organisms such as muscle fibers, enzymes, and hemoglobin. Proteins are made of unique combinations of the twenty amino acid monomers. A string of amino acid monomers joined together by peptide bonds is called a polypeptide.<br />Nucleic Acids are RNA and DNA. DNA is the carrier of genetic information- specifically the code for making proteins. RNA aids in the process of synthesizing proteins.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is participates in almost every process within cells. It is involved in the processes of DNA replication, cell signaling, catalyzing metabolic reactions, construction of cell and tissue structures, and transportation of molecules from one place to another.Biomolecules are an organic molecule that including carbohydrates,protein,lipids and nucleic acid.These are important for the survival of living cells.Some of valuable biomolecules has a huge demand,which cannot be fulfilled from their renewable resources.Carbohydrates are often used by living things for two main purposes. They are used as an energy source or storage form and they are used as a structural component.Protein participates in practically every process of a cell. It plays a part in metabolic reactions, immune response, protein provides a source of energy, assists in cellular repair, form blood cells, and more.Nucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life. They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and carry instructions for the functioning of the cell.Lipids are the main component of the cell membrane and are often referred to as fats. Proteins serve as pumps or channels moving materials in and out of the cell membrane. Carbohydrates are compounds that form sugars and are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.These nutrients are digested into simpler compounds. Carbohydrates are used for energy (glucose). Fats are used for energy after they are broken into fatty acids. Protein can also be used for energy, but the first job is to help with making hormones, muscle, and other proteins.</p><br />

                            5. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</h2><br />

Include also in your essay the importance of this property to the body. The essay must consist of not less than 15 sentences and not more than 30 sentences.​</h2><br />
                        Water is one of the most important substances for life, and it has many unique properties that make it essential for living organisms. One of these properties is its acid-base property, which refers to the ability of water to act as either an acid or a base depending on the situation.<br /><br />When water is pure, it is neutral, meaning that it has an equal concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-). However, when other substances are added to water, it can become either acidic or basic. If a substance releases hydrogen ions into the water, it will increase the concentration of H+ ions and make the water acidic. On the other hand, if a substance releases hydroxide ions into the water, it will increase the concentration of OH- ions and make the water basic.<br /><br />The pH scale is used to measure the acidity or basicity of a substance, and it ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral, while a pH below 7 is acidic and a pH above 7 is basic. The acid-base property of water is important because it helps to maintain the pH balance in the body.<br /><br />The human body is a complex system that requires a specific pH balance to function properly. For example, the pH of blood must be between 7.35 and 7.45 for the body to function normally. If the pH of the blood becomes too acidic or too basic, it can lead to a range of health problems.<br /><br />The acid-base balance in the body is maintained by a complex system of buffers, which are substances that can either absorb or release hydrogen ions to keep the pH level stable. One of the most important buffers in the body is bicarbonate, which is a base that can neutralize acids. When the body produces too much acid, the bicarbonate buffer system helps to remove the excess acid and maintain a healthy pH balance.<br /><br />In addition to its role in maintaining the pH balance in the body, the acid-base property of water is also important in many other areas. For example, it is used in agriculture to determine the acidity of soil and to help determine the best crops to plant. It is also used in manufacturing to control the pH of chemical reactions and to produce certain products.<br /><br />In conclusion, the acid-base property of water is an important aspect of its chemistry that plays a critical role in many areas of life. From maintaining the pH balance in the body to determining the best crops to plant, the acid-base proper<br />

The buffer then neutralizes the added acid by converting it to its weak acid form.

The buffer then neutralizes the added base by converting it to its weak base form.</p><p></p><p>The buffer capacity of a buffer solution is its ability to resist changes in pH when an acid or base is added to it.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality. 
What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph?
Select one:
a. Comparison
b. Etymology
c. Connotation

e. Extensive definition
f. Intensive definition
