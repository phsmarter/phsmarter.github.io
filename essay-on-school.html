                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>school,school is the most perfect place to learn and of course to eat snacks</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I will show you the two best reasons why education is important in our society.</p><p></p><p>The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence.</p><p></p><p>That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Essay about school scenery<p></p><p></p><p>Eight long periods make our minds dull. Especially the periods after recess are very tiresome. We eagerly look forward to the last period. Many of us become inattentive in the class. They are restless in their seats. As the peon moves towards the bell, the boys get ready with their bags. The last bell rings and the school are over. The gate opens. The boys move out like the rushing waters of a mountain stream.</p><p></p><p>The scene at this time is very noisy. Some naughty boys make whistling noise. Every boy tries to rush out of the class room before the others. The ground is crowded with the boys. There are some gentle boys. They walk out slowly and silently with their books. Most of the boys are in a hurry to reach their homes. They are tired and hungry. Some of them stand in queue at the bus stop to catch the buses. Others walk on foot. All of lessons and games etc. A few make mischief on the way. They make jokes with their class fellows. Small groups of boys can be seen walking and talking along the road.</p><p></p><p>Soon the boys and teachers are out of the school gate. They take their way home. The school building is now quite desolate. The dust settles down. The peon locks the rooms. The atmosphere is calm and quiet now. The school, which was full of life and activity a few minutes ago, has now lost its charm.</p><p></p><p>Many boys are not so happy when they con. To school in the morning, but they are very cheerful when they leave school for home. They jump with joy and shout with delight. The school closes. The students call it a day.</p><p></p>#CARRYONLEARNING<p>Sorry For Long Answer</p><br />

                            9. Essay about role model in school </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Growing up, I had supportive but strict parents and three older siblings to use as my role models. When I say my parents are strict, it stems from the fact that my dad is a Baptist pastor. Given that my dad is a pastor; my parents expected me and my siblings to go to school, church, and participate in extracurricular activities before or after school. So, I didn’t miss school unless I had to, I went to church every Sunday and I participated in fellowship of Christian athletes and band. My Sunday school teachers expected that I would have all my bible verses memorized ahead of time in AWANA. My band director expected that I had practiced a lot for auditions and that I would get first chair because he knew my parents made me practice. All in all, I had a great support system during my childhood which has helped shape me into who I am today, a goodie little two shoes, some would say. Now that I am almost entirely independent from my parents, I still enjoy things that I enjoyed as a child such as going to church, spending time outside and seeing my family. However, I also enjoy things I didn’t experience growing up such as playing pool, traveling to places of my choice, or volunteering at places of my choice such as a nursing home. I have been working at an assisted living facility for two years now and I love working in geriatrics. I never would have known that as a child because I didn’t experience volunteering with elderly people.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            15. Essay about School Uniform​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>School uniforms have been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that school uniforms are necessary for promoting discipline and improving academic performance, while others believe that uniforms stifle individuality and creativity. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of school uniforms.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the main benefits of school uniforms is that they promote a sense of discipline and order among students. By requiring students to wear a uniform, schools are able to enforce a certain level of conformity and discourage behaviors that might disrupt the learning environment. This can help to create a more focused and productive atmosphere in the classroom.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In addition, school uniforms can help to reduce social inequality and promote a sense of equality among students. When everyone is wearing the same uniform, it is harder to tell who is wealthy and who is not. This can help to reduce bullying and other forms of social exclusion that can be based on clothing or other markers of socioeconomic status.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>On the other hand, critics argue that school uniforms stifle individuality and creativity. They argue that students should be allowed to express themselves through their clothing and that uniforms can be too restrictive. This can be especially problematic for students who may not have a lot of other outlets for self-expression.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Furthermore, school uniforms can be expensive and can create an additional financial burden for families who may already be struggling. This can lead to feelings of resentment or unfairness among students who are unable to afford the latest styles or trends.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to school uniforms. While uniforms can promote discipline and equality, they may also stifle individuality and create financial burdens for families. Ultimately, the decision to implement school uniforms should be based on the needs and values of the individual school community.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying in School</p><p>             Bullying in the schools has negative effects on individual students and on the school climate as a whole. Bullying can cause long-term problems for both the victims of bullying and the bullies themselves. To explore the effects of bullying on adolescents, we will define bullying, identify the characteristics of bullies and victims, outline the extent and consequences of bullying, and present resources for further information and assistance.</p><p>             Bullying is any behavior that is initiated by one or more students against a victim or victims that causes physical or psychological intimidation. Bullying behaviors can be classified as either direct (such as teasing, threatening, hitting, or stealing) or indirect (such as rumor spreading or social isolation). Boys typically employed direct methods of bullying, while girls tend to use in direct methods. Either way, behaviors must occur repeatedly overtime to be classified as bullying.</p><p>             Characteristics of Bullies and Victims</p><p>             There are specific behaviors that bullies tend to exhibit. The bullies often need to feel powerful and in control. They may feel no remorse when they inflict injury and suffering on others. Bullies tend to defy authority and are likely to break school rules. They seem to have little anxiety and appear to possess high self-esteem. Students who come from homes characterized by physical punishment tend to be more likely to exhibit these types of behaviors.</p><p>             Victims also tend to exhibit specific characteristics. They are often anxious, insecure, cautious, and have low self-esteem. Victims tend to be socially isolated, and may lack social skills and friends. Because they tend to be weaker than their peers, either physically or socially, victims rarely retaliate against bullies. Students who have close ties with their parents/guardians or who have overprotective parents/guardians are more likely to be victimized by bullies. </p><br />

They also learn about science, history, social studies, and other subjects that contribute to their intellectual development. These skills and knowledge are critical in preparing the youth for future careers and personal success.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, schools provide an environment that encourages social interaction and networking among young people.

This exposure to different ideas, beliefs, and perspectives enables them to build a strong sense of community and respect for others, which is essential in building a more tolerant and peaceful society.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, being in school provides the youth with a structured routine and discipline. Schools have rules and regulations that promote discipline and structure in the daily lives of young people. This routine helps young people to develop good habits such as time management, punctuality, and responsibility, which are essential in building a successful career and personal life.</p><p>Lastly, education is essential in promoting economic development. Education is a key driver of economic growth and development, as it provides the necessary skills and knowledge that contribute to innovation, technological advancements, and productivity. Education also increases the earning potential of individuals, which contributes to their economic well-being and that of their families and communities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, education is a fundamental right for every individual, and the youth should be in school. Education provides young people with the necessary knowledge and skills that are essential for their personal and professional growth. It also provides an environment that encourages social interaction and networking among young people. Education promotes discipline, structure, and routine, which are essential in building a successful career and personal life. Finally, education is essential in promoting economic growth and development. Therefore, governments, parents, and all stakeholders must work together to ensure that the youth receive quality education that prepares them for the future.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Ur welcome paki brainlist </p><br />
