                                            According to Owen Flanagan (2000), there are four major philosophical questions about dreaming:
1. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming?
2. Can I be immoral in dreams?
3. Are dreams conscious experiences that occur during sleep?
4. Does dreaming have an evolutionary function?
These interrelated questions cover philosophical domains as diverse as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, scientific methodology, and the philosophy of biology, mind and language. This article covers the four questions and also looks at some newly emerging philosophical questions about dreams:
5. Is dreaming an ideal scientific model for consciousness research?
6. Is dreaming an instance of hallucinating or imagining?
Section 1 introduces the traditional philosophical question that Descartes asked himself, a question which has championed scepticism about the external world. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming, or dreaming right now? Philosophers have typically looked for features that distinguish dreams from waking life and one key debate centres on whether it is possible to feel pain in a dream.
Section 2 surveys the ethics of dreaming. The classical view of Augustine is contrasted with more abstract ethical positions, namely, those of the Deontologist, the Consequentialist and the Virtue Ethicist. The notion of lucid dreaming is examined here in light of the question of responsibility during dreaming and how we treat other dream characters.
Sections 3 covers the various different positions, objections and replies to question 3: the debate about whether dreaming is, or is not, a conscious state. The challenges from Malcolm and Dennett are covered. These challenges question the authority of the common-sense view of dreaming as a consciously experienced state. Malcolm argues that the concept of dreaming is incoherent, while Dennett puts forward a theory of dreaming without appealing to consciousness.
Section 4 covers the evolutionary debate, where empirical work ultimately leaves us uncertain of the extent to which natural selection has shaped dreaming, if at all. Early approaches by Freud and Jung are reviewed, followed by approaches by Flanagan and Revonsuo. Though Freud, Jung and Revonsuo have argued that dreaming is functional, Flanagan represents a view shared by many neuroscientists that dreaming has no function at all.
Section 5 looks at questions 5 and 6. Question 5 is about the cutting edge issue of precisely how dreaming should be integrated into the research program of consciousness. Should dreaming be taken as a scientific model of consciousness? Might dreaming play another role such as a contrast analysis with other mental states? Question 6, which raises a question of the exact qualitative nature of dreaming, has a longer history, though it is also receiving contemporary attention. The section outlines reasons favouring the orthodox view of psychology, that dream imagery is perceptual (hallucinatory), and reasons favouring the philosophical challenge to that orthodoxy, that dreams are ultimately imaginative in nature.

Do this in your answer sheet.Gaea Katreena CabicoNew coronavirus mutation found in the PhilippinesA mutation of the novel coronavirus believed to be more infectious than the original variant has been detected in the Philippines, genomic researchers said.The new mutation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been reported to have become the dominantcoronavirus strain circulating around the world. Researchers called the new strain G614. When the outbreak began in thecountry last March, the original D614 genotype showed up in the positive samples collected by the Philippine Genome Center (PGC). But in a new study, genomic researchers detected both the D614 and the G614."We now report the detection of the D614 variant among nine randomly selected COVID-19 positive samples collected in Quezon City in July. In the month of June, both the D614 as well as the G614 have been detected in a small sample of positive cases." PGC said in an August 13 bulletin."Although this information confirms the presence of G614 in the Philippines, we note that all the samples tested were fromQuezon City and may not represent the mutational landscape for the whole country," it added.Last month, researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Duke University in North Carolina published a study that a specific change in SARS-CoV-2 virus genome is more infectious in cell culture. The team analyzed the data of 999 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and observed that those infected with G614 had more viral particles in them.They, however, did not find evidence of G614 impact on disease severity. In other words, it was not significantly associated with hospitalization status."There is still no definitive evidence showing that camers of the G614 variant are actually more transmissible than thosewith D614, and the mutation does not appear to substantially affect clinical outcomes as well," PGC said. The genome center stressed the importance of continuously monitoring G614 to help formulate containment, diagnosticand therapeutic strategies: "Itong sinasabi, cila na D614G mutation may higher possibility na mas transmissible siya, mas higher ang level niya na makaka-transmit sya sa iba or infectious. Pero wala pa rin tayong solid evidence to say na yan talaga ay mangyayad." Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a media forum Monday. (They say D614G mutation has higher possibility that it is transmissible, it has higher level that it can transmit to others orinfectious. But we still don't have solid evidence to say that will happen.)She also said that the PGC has been authorized by the DOH to continue the study to gather more information about thevirus. The novel coronavirus has so far infected 161 253 people in the country despite imposing one of the longest andstrictest lockdowns. Of the figure, 112,586 have recovered and 2,665 have died.Questions:1. What is the main topic of this report? 2. Is the overall purpose of the report clear?

                            6. According to Owen Flanagan (2000), there are four major philosophical questions about dreaming:
1. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming?
2. Can I be immoral in dreams?
3. Are dreams conscious experiences that occur during sleep?
4. Does dreaming have an evolutionary function?
These interrelated questions cover philosophical domains as diverse as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, scientific methodology, and the philosophy of biology, mind and language. This article covers the four questions and also looks at some newly emerging philosophical questions about dreams:
5. Is dreaming an ideal scientific model for consciousness research?
6. Is dreaming an instance of hallucinating or imagining?
Section 1 introduces the traditional philosophical question that Descartes asked himself, a question which has championed scepticism about the external world. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming, or dreaming right now? Philosophers have typically looked for features that distinguish dreams from waking life and one key debate centres on whether it is possible to feel pain in a dream.
Section 2 surveys the ethics of dreaming. The classical view of Augustine is contrasted with more abstract ethical positions, namely, those of the Deontologist, the Consequentialist and the Virtue Ethicist. The notion of lucid dreaming is examined here in light of the question of responsibility during dreaming and how we treat other dream characters.
Sections 3 covers the various different positions, objections and replies to question 3: the debate about whether dreaming is, or is not, a conscious state. The challenges from Malcolm and Dennett are covered. These challenges question the authority of the common-sense view of dreaming as a consciously experienced state. Malcolm argues that the concept of dreaming is incoherent, while Dennett puts forward a theory of dreaming without appealing to consciousness.
Section 4 covers the evolutionary debate, where empirical work ultimately leaves us uncertain of the extent to which natural selection has shaped dreaming, if at all. Early approaches by Freud and Jung are reviewed, followed by approaches by Flanagan and Revonsuo. Though Freud, Jung and Revonsuo have argued that dreaming is functional, Flanagan represents a view shared by many neuroscientists that dreaming has no function at all.
Section 5 looks at questions 5 and 6. Question 5 is about the cutting edge issue of precisely how dreaming should be integrated into the research program of consciousness. Should dreaming be taken as a scientific model of consciousness? Might dreaming play another role such as a contrast analysis with other mental states? Question 6, which raises a question of the exact qualitative nature of dreaming, has a longer history, though it is also receiving contemporary attention. The section outlines reasons favouring the orthodox view of psychology, that dream imagery is perceptual (hallucinatory), and reasons favouring the philosophical challenge to that orthodoxy, that dreams are ultimately imaginative in nature.

                            11. Learning Task 2: Read the informative text below. Analyze the text by answering the provided prompt questions about informative genre. Do this in your answer sheet.Gaea Katreena CabicoNew coronavirus mutation found in the PhilippinesA mutation of the novel coronavirus believed to be more infectious than the original variant has been detected in the Philippines, genomic researchers said.The new mutation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been reported to have become the dominantcoronavirus strain circulating around the world. Researchers called the new strain G614. When the outbreak began in thecountry last March, the original D614 genotype showed up in the positive samples collected by the Philippine Genome Center (PGC). But in a new study, genomic researchers detected both the D614 and the G614."We now report the detection of the D614 variant among nine randomly selected COVID-19 positive samples collected in Quezon City in July. In the month of June, both the D614 as well as the G614 have been detected in a small sample of positive cases." PGC said in an August 13 bulletin."Although this information confirms the presence of G614 in the Philippines, we note that all the samples tested were fromQuezon City and may not represent the mutational landscape for the whole country," it added.Last month, researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Duke University in North Carolina published a study that a specific change in SARS-CoV-2 virus genome is more infectious in cell culture. The team analyzed the data of 999 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and observed that those infected with G614 had more viral particles in them.They, however, did not find evidence of G614 impact on disease severity. In other words, it was not significantly associated with hospitalization status."There is still no definitive evidence showing that camers of the G614 variant are actually more transmissible than thosewith D614, and the mutation does not appear to substantially affect clinical outcomes as well," PGC said. The genome center stressed the importance of continuously monitoring G614 to help formulate containment, diagnosticand therapeutic strategies: "Itong sinasabi, cila na D614G mutation may higher possibility na mas transmissible siya, mas higher ang level niya na makaka-transmit sya sa iba or infectious. Pero wala pa rin tayong solid evidence to say na yan talaga ay mangyayad." Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a media forum Monday. (They say D614G mutation has higher possibility that it is transmissible, it has higher level that it can transmit to others orinfectious. But we still don't have solid evidence to say that will happen.)She also said that the PGC has been authorized by the DOH to continue the study to gather more information about thevirus. The novel coronavirus has so far infected 161 253 people in the country despite imposing one of the longest andstrictest lockdowns. Of the figure, 112,586 have recovered and 2,665 have died.Questions:1. What is the main topic of this report? 2. Is the overall purpose of the report clear?

                        Answer(s):The main topic of this report is the discovery of a new mutation of the novel coronavirus, known as G614, in the Philippines.Yes, the overall purpose of the report is clear. The author wants to inform the readers about the discovery of the new mutation and its possible implications. The readers are expected to stay updated with the latest developments and continue to follow recommended safety measures.The author starts the report by introducing the new mutation of the novel coronavirus found in the Philippines. The report ends with a statement from the Health Undersecretary emphasizing the importance of continuously monitoring the mutation and gathering more information about the virus.This report conveys information efficiently by presenting the facts and the opinions of the experts in a clear and concise manner. The report is well-structured, and the information is organized logically.This report is interesting because it presents new information about the mutation of the novel coronavirus and its possible implications. The report is also relevant to the ongoing global pandemic, which makes it more engaging for the readers.The author could have included more details about the scientific research and methodology used to identify the new mutation. This could have made the report more interesting and informative for readers who are interested in the technical aspects of the discovery.I was surprised to learn that the G614 mutation does not appear to substantially affect clinical outcomes or hospitalization status, despite being more infectious in cell culture. This highlights the complexity of the virus and the need for further research to understand its behavior and develop effective strategies to combat it.This type of informational report would be good for describing new discoveries or developments related to the pandemic, such as the development of new treatments, vaccines, or public health measures.This type of writing, known as informative writing, focuses on presenting factual information and educating the readers about a particular topic. Narrative writing, on the other hand, focuses on telling a story or describing events in a creative and engaging manner.<p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
