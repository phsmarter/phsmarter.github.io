                                            The laws of motions always remind us that we should be careful in everything that we do because for every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction. If we do good things to others, they will also do good things, not everyone but someone will. Just like what Mr. Klaus said in the movie Klaus, "a simple act of kindness always sparks another".Make a reflection and write it on the answer sheet.​</a>

What is in these stories that you like? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. A good book has a unique plot, well-made characters and gives us the feels. Characteristics of a good book is the emotions that the writer wants to reach us, the writer wanted us to feel what he/she feels, we wanted to relate, to connect in the story, and to feel that happiness.</p><p></p><p>2. For me, I prefer reading books. Because in books it has a unique way of creating the story and the caracters has a well-developed attitude. And when I read books, I feel like I'm being connected to it or attached to it, I feel like I am inside the story and I am the main character in it.</p><p></p><p>3. Escape means that you want to find something that is different from the reality, just like reading books. You read books to escape reality, you wanted to be inside the story because in books everything is possible whether you fall in love with a gangster or surviving a plane crash and so on. No, the girls are not running away. It simply means that we wanted to escape from the hard things we endured or overcome, it means that we just wanted to chill and escape from our problems.</p><p></p><p>4. Liza. Because just like Liza said she wanted to escape, and so reading books is her escape.</p><p></p><p>5. There is a lot actually, but I'll just give two. These are If I fall and I'm inlove with a gamer. In If I fall, the stories tells us that even if you are different, there will always be a person who will love you, who will completely accept you. (Spoiler!) And in the end the girl doesn't choose anyone from the both guys who loves her because she wanted to make decisions for herself and she is thankful that someone likes her for who she is and what she is. In I'm inlove with a gamer, what I realized in here is that even if you are completely different or not nice, there will always be a person who will change you and will accept you. And even if there are many problems they have encountered, they never give up. They will fight for their love and fight for who they love.</p><br />

                            12. The laws of motions always remind us that we should be careful in everything that we do because for every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction. If we do good things to others, they will also do good things, not everyone but someone will. Just like what Mr. Klaus said in the movie Klaus, "a simple act of kindness always sparks another".Make a reflection and write it on the answer sheet.​</h2><br />
                        <p>It is an unplanned act whose goal is to bring kindness and spread kindness to those we know and those we do not know. It’s a practice that offers hope to unsuspecting people to provide a ray of light in someone’s life. It brings a smile to a frown; it can create a positive emotion when none was expected; it can be the beginning of a new start; and it has the capability to change how we treat one another</p><br />

                            17. Directions: In your English Notebook. Identify the statement and what makes it biased. Scenario #1: You want to watch an upcoming thriller movie and so you read movie reviews online. You came across the blog of the famous movie critic, Cameron Panis Jr. He isn't a fan of Vince Disel, the star of the movie "Pandemic Revolution" because of an incident when Vince spilled sauce on Cameron's shoes. Although Cameron enjoyed the movie, he didn't put on a good review and commented that Vince Disel is a lousy actor who just paraded his muscled body. Scenario #2: Minchin is interested in buying a new smartphone since it will be needed for his online classes. She goes to the All Phone Store and inquires about the latest A Phone series. Mr. Barnie, the manager, discourages Minchin from buying A Phone and stating its limitations and keeps on showing Minchin different models of phones. Minchin finds out that All Phone Store does not sell A Phone series.​</h2><br />

Cameron's negative comments about Vince Disel's acting are not based on the performance of the actor in the movie but on his personal bias. The bias affects the objectivity and fairness of the movie review.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The bias in Scenario #2 comes from Mr. Barnie, the manager of the All Phone Store. He is discouraging Minchin from buying the A Phone series and instead keeps showing her different models of phones. This indicates that Mr. Barnie may have a financial interest in promoting the other phone models, which can make his opinions biased. Moreover, it is also biased because he did not provide Minchin with complete and accurate information. He should have informed her right away that they do not sell the A Phone series, instead of trying to sway her to other phone models. This lack of transparency can mislead the customer and make them feel like they are being taken advantage of.</strong></p><p></p><br />
