                            5. ESSAY: Write at least 10-15 sentences. Use the space provided below.TOPIC: “Educational Value in Festival Dance​</h2><br />
                        <p>ANSWER,</p><p>1.  Dancing Ability</p><p></p><p>It’s universal and truly portable.  With the basic understanding of the fundamentals of dance that taking dance lessons provides, you can literally dance throughout the world.  All forms of dance have similar foundational principles, and having the dancing ability that comes with building upon these principles is a valuable skill that is always fun to have at dances and other social events that involve dancing.</p><p></p><p>2.  Social Interaction</p><p></p><p>Dance lessons have a way of developing and improving social relationships.  Maybe it’s the respect and control that dance lessons emphasize and teach.  Maybe it’s just the camaraderie of learning something valuable side-by-side with peers in a group setting.  Either way, dance lesions promote the lasting value of quality social interaction.</p><p></p><p>3.  Having A Healthy Hobby</p><p></p><p>Having healthy hobbies are important to living a well balanced life.  And we all know how healthy, physically and mentally, that dance can be.  Dance lessons teach fitness, coordination, balance, flexibility, and so much more—all in a fun and low-pressure environment.  Mixing these valuable qualities with the fun and excitement of dance makes for the perfect healthy hobby that lasts for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>4.  Lasting Friendships Formed</p><p></p><p>Speaking of lasting values, what better value in life is there than a great friendship?  Through the social interaction and the diversity found in group dance lessons, it’s hard not to make fast friends.  Having a friendship that shares a common passion like dance is more than a value…it’s truly invaluable.</p><p></p><p>5.  Educational Value</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the most important value of all is the educational value that dance lessons promote.  Clearly, dance lessons go beyond book learning, though.  They also go beyond just learning the steps and movements that make up dance routines.  The educational values of dance tend to surround learning discipline, responsibility, and respect.  And it is through these lasting values that nearly anything in life is possible.</p><p></p><p>Again, learning to dance is exciting, worthwhile, and valuable.  The lasting values of dance lessons offer both immediate and long term satisfaction.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>The goal of values education is to create a citizen of the Philippines who will work to build a solid, culturally rich identity for themselves as well as a democratic country and community.</strong></p><p></p><p>1. The Department of Education began implementing the <strong>Good Manners and Right Conduct (GMRC) </strong>rules at the primary and secondary levels in 1991 through department orders. Values Education/GMRC as a subject centers on four main themes: respecting oneself, respecting others, respecting one's nation, and respecting God. Along with rational thought and value judgment formed through an experience approach, it also emphasizes appropriate norms of behavior as established by Philippine society.</p><p></p><p>2.<strong> "Edukasyong Pagpapakatao"</strong> is currently part of the K–12 curriculum. Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao, which emphasizes developing a person's ability to make moral and ethical decisions and acts, replaces Character Education at the elementary school level. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the program at the secondary level is founded on ethics and career counselling. Self and humanity concepts, moral principles, professional options, and accountability are all covered. The various subjects are focused on character-based education or instilling values. Despite the program's distinct presentation, it stuck to the <strong>GMRC </strong>subject's four main themes of self-worth, social harmony, patriotism, and international solidarity, as well as love of God and a preference for right over wrong.</p><p></p><p>3. A student's character as an individual, a member of society, and a citizen should be developed, therefore <strong>Good Manners and Right Conduct (GMRC) </strong>should be ingrained at the elementary and secondary levels. This will ensure that values will be integrated into all study areas.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about GMRC and Values Education, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9678613</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9459001</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

This is caused by the concern that the virus would spread further than it already is. As we all know, the governments have tried their best in mitigating the whole issue, and one of them is imposing the<strong> 24 hour curfew policy for minors. </strong></p><p></p><p>I think this policy is very effective since it limits how people would socialize or at least go out of their homes where the possibility of contacting the virus would increase. By putting the <strong>curfew</strong>, at the very least everyone would have a less time to worry about meeting others who might be carrying the virus.</p><p></p><p>The implementation itself can be enforced also by the authority with the help of the police. Meanwhile, the minors in question would have to find ways to <strong>spend their time at home</strong>, and this can be done by them studying or doing their hobbies which can be done at home.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>the topic of argumentative text</strong> by referring to https://brainly.ph/question/11702180</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
