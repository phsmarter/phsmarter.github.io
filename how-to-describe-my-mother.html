                                            My mother grew old and became thin but Anita never stopped asking favors from mother that made me mad about her. One day, she asked mother to knit a shawl. Mother could not say no even though the task was so difficult for her. My heart grew sad every time I saw her doing the laborious task but she never complained. I never wanted to see Mother lift a finger. She was too old to work. And we wanted to save the burden even doing the lightest household chores. Question Answer 3. How do you describe Mother? 4. Is it reasonable to let your mother work even when she's already old? Why, why not? 5. If you are the sister, what would you have told Anita?​</a>

Firstly, I aim to show my appreciation by being a responsible and compassionate individual, striving to make her proud in everything I do. Additionally, I intend to support her emotionally and be a constant source of love and care, just as she has been for me. Furthermore, I aspire to ease her burdens and ensure her comfort as she grows older, always making sure she feels cherished and valued. Lastly, I am determined to honor her sacrifices by passing on the invaluable life lessons she has taught me to future generations, ensuring that her wisdom and love continue to shape our family's legacy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, my mother is my hero, and her role in my life and our family is unparalleled.
