                                                       My Mother, My Strength!   My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.   She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which I envy.   They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then, I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher she never pushes students and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job. My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. 'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes.   My mom is the dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness. Questions:What is the introduction? Body? Conclusion? What are written in the first paragraph? How did the author describe her mim in the second and third paragraph?How is the paragraph concluded? Is it justified? ​</a>

                            7.            My Mother, My Strength!   My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.   She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which I envy.   They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then, I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher she never pushes students and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job. My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. 'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes.   My mom is the dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness. Questions:What is the introduction? Body? Conclusion? What are written in the first paragraph?

I have been toBoracay that is why I know these two awesome tourist destinations are similar inmany ways. Both are small islands that have five beaches, hillside terraces andcool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisines because peoplefrom all over the world visit them. However, Bali'sbeaches are golden while thoseof Boracay are white and the sand is fine as powder.
