Environmental Protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, organizations and governments. ______2. We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change. ______3. The main function of ecosystem conservation is protecting or restoring the structure, function and species compilation within the system. This can get hard quickly because everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. ______4. Mangroves are essential to maintaining water quality. With their dense network of roots and surrounding vegetation, they filter and trap sediments, heavy metals, and other pollutants. ______5. Coral reefs does protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation. ______6. The ecosystem is an environment where both living and non-living things exist and interact with one another Examples of ecosystem are the tropical rainforests, coral reefs, and mangrove swamps.______7. Coral reefs serve as habitat for many animals. They are the breeding ground of marine life. They are composed of living components only such as water and sand and living components such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, cnidarians, sponges and echinoderms. ______8. Mangrove Swamps is an important system that allows for the breeding of fishes and survival of other marine animals.______9. Being responsible to the development and restoration of Earth's resources like the tropical rainforests, mangrove swamps and coral reefs is a key for the long-term benefits to mankind. ______10.

                                            Hello there! I need your help. I want to find out the abiotic components presentin our ecosystem. Can you help me? All you have to do is read and understand thecontext below to find out. Are you ready? Let's start!The world where we live in is a place made up of both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) factors, which refer to the organisms that interact directly or indirectly.Organisms interact with one another in the ecosystem in order to receive theresources they need to survive. All organisms in an ecosystem are interdependent.Interdependence is the reliance of every life form on other organisms and theenvironment.Ecosystem can be as small as the community of insects living in a single treeor as large as the entire planet. While ecosystems appear very different from oneanother they all contain biotic and abiotic components. These components make upour ecosystem.Look around you. What do you see? Everything you see is part of ourecosystem. From the air that we breath, the swaying of trees caused by the wind, theburrowing worms in the soil, the hot temperature caused by the sun rays and thesplashing of water in a stream are some of the biotic and abiotic components in ourecosystem.Changes in the environment specifically in abiotic factors can disrupt thenatural balance in the ecosystem. Human interaction has been the cause of manychanges in the environment. That is why we need to take care of our environment tomaintain its ability to support varied forms of life.​</a>

While ecosystems appear very different from one another they all contain biotic and abiotic components. These components make up Look around you. What do you see? Everything you see is part of our ecosystem. From the air that we breath, the swaying of trees caused by the wind, the burrowing worms in the soil, the hot temperature caused by the sun rays and the splashing of water in a stream are some of the biotic and abiotic components in our Changes in the environment specifically in abiotic factors can disrupt the natural balance in the ecosystem.

We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change. ______3. The main function of ecosystem conservation is protecting or restoring the structure, function and species compilation within the system. This can get hard quickly because everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. ______4. Mangroves are essential to maintaining water quality. With their dense network of roots and surrounding vegetation, they filter and trap sediments, heavy metals, and other pollutants. ______5. Coral reefs does protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation. ______6. The ecosystem is an environment where both living and non-living things exist and interact with one another Examples of ecosystem are the tropical rainforests, coral reefs, and mangrove swamps.______7. Coral reefs serve as habitat for many animals. They are the breeding ground of marine life. They are composed of living components only such as water and sand and living components such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, cnidarians, sponges and echinoderms. ______8. Mangrove Swamps is an important system that allows for the breeding of fishes and survival of other marine animals.______9.

                            22. Hello there! I need your help. I want to find out the abiotic components presentin our ecosystem. Can you help me? All you have to do is read and understand thecontext below to find out. Are you ready? Let's start!The world where we live in is a place made up of both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) factors, which refer to the organisms that interact directly or indirectly.Organisms interact with one another in the ecosystem in order to receive theresources they need to survive. All organisms in an ecosystem are interdependent.Interdependence is the reliance of every life form on other organisms and theenvironment.Ecosystem can be as small as the community of insects living in a single treeor as large as the entire planet. While ecosystems appear very different from oneanother they all contain biotic and abiotic components. These components make upour ecosystem.Look around you. What do you see? Everything you see is part of ourecosystem. From the air that we breath, the swaying of trees caused by the wind, theburrowing worms in the soil, the hot temperature caused by the sun rays and thesplashing of water in a stream are some of the biotic and abiotic components in ourecosystem.Changes in the environment specifically in abiotic factors can disrupt thenatural balance in the ecosystem. Human interaction has been the cause of manychanges in the environment. That is why we need to take care of our environment tomaintain its ability to support varied forms of life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An abiotic factor is a non-living part of an ecosystem that shapes its environment. In a terrestrial ecosystem, examples might include temperature, light, and water. In a marine ecosystem, abiotic factors would include salinity and ocean currents.</p><p></p><br />
