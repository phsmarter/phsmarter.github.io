                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID 19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented f the threat of COVID-19. because of thFirst reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to say at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and evaluating its implementation for the reason that homeschooling afollowscurriculum that is approved by Dep DepEd.Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don't want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021.

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time
Essay Topic: Learning at Home during Lockdown: My
Parents and My Teachers
is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Single parenting is one of the toughest jobs in the world. Having to juggle the demands of children, careers, home life, and personal time can be exhausting. Single parents have no one to rely on and must do it all themselves. Although single parenthood is a challenge, a single parent can still rise to the challenge and find success.</p><p></p><p>Single parents are facing a unique set of challenges. Most often, they are primary caretakers and financial providers. They balance work, housekeeping, and parenting while also finding time to cope with the emotional stress of being a single parent. Often, they do not have the same level of emotional, physical, or financial support from another adult.</p><p></p><p>Many single parents are left with the burden of having to explain to their children why there is only one parent in their household. This can be a difficult task and often comes with a lot of guilt for the single parent. The lack of another adult in the home can also be difficult for a child, especially during important developmental stages. Single parents must make an extra effort to ensure their children have access to support and resources to counter this.</p><p></p><p>In addition to parenting and providing financially, single parents often struggle to make time for their own emotional and physical well-being. Juggling between work, familial responsibilities, and personal time can cause stress and exhaustion. It is important for single parents to take the time to practice self-care, such as taking time for themselves and getting adequate sleep.</p><p></p><p>Though single parents have more responsibilities than both-parent households, they can still be successful. Single parents should accept help when it is offered and should not be afraid to ask for help. Joining support groups, such as single parent networks or single parent forums, can help single parents make connections and provide moral support. Taking advantage of resources such as local community centers and daycare can also be beneficial.</p><p></p><p>With dedication, resilience, and support, single parents can lead healthy and balanced lives. Rather than dwelling on the difficulties of being a single parent, single parents should focus on the joys of raising children, knowing that they are providing the best life for them. With the right mindset, single parents can be successful in parenting and in life.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>No. Single Parents are not allowed to adopt a child.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A child should grow normally with both father and mother and eventually siblings. The adoptee must also be married and have a good financial source of income. They must not have criminal records and are free from any suits.</p><p>An adopted child should be raised and grow in a family.</p><br />

                            6. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Evolution of Life
</p><p>The diversity of life on Earth today is the result of evolution. Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since. At first, all living things on Earth were simple, single-celled organisms. Much later, the first multicellular organisms evolved, and after that, Earth’s biodiversity greatly increased. Figure below shows a timeline of the history of life on Earth. You can also find an interactive timeline of the history of life at the link
</p><p>
</p><p>Darwin and the Theory of Evolution
</p><p>The idea of evolution has been around for centuries. In fact, it goes all the way back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. However, evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin. Darwin published a book on evolution in 1859 titled On the Origin of Species. In the book, Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection. He also presented a great deal of evidence that evolution occurs.
</p><p>
</p><p>Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. As described by Darwin, evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural selection, some members of a species, being better adapted or suited to their environment, produce more offspring than others, so they pass "advantageous traits" to their offspring. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of the species. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment. This is because they evolve adaptations. An adaptation is a trait that helps an organism survive and reproduce in a given environment.
</p><p>
</p><p>Despite all the evidence Darwin presented, his theory was not well-received at first. Many people found it hard to accept the idea that humans had evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and they saw evolution as a challenge to their religious beliefs. Look at the cartoon in Figure below. Drawn in 1871, it depicts Darwin himself as an ape. The cartoon reflects how many people felt about Darwin and his theory during his own time. Darwin had actually expected this type of reaction to his theory and had waited a long time before publishing his book for this reason. It was only when another scientist, named Alfred Russel Wallace, developed essentially the same theory of evolution that Darwin put his book into print.
</p><p>
</p><p>Charles Darwin’s name is linked with the theory of evolution. This cartoon from the 1870s makes fun of both Darwin and his theory.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although Darwin presented a great deal of evidence for evolution in his book, he was unable to explain how evolution occurs. That’s because he knew nothing about genes. As a result, he didn’t know how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, let alone how they could change over time.
</p><p>
</p><p>Evolutionary Theory After Darwin
</p><p>Since Darwin’s time, scientists have gathered even more evidence to support the theory of evolution. Some of the evidence comes from fossils, and some comes from studies that show how similar living things are to one another. By the 1930s, scientists had also learned about genes. As a result, they could finally explain how characteristics of organisms could pass from one generation to the next and change over time.
</p><p>
</p><p>Using modern technology, scientists can now directly compare the genes of living species. The more genes different species share in common, the more closely related the species are presumed to be. Consider humans and chimpanzees. They share about 98% of their genes. This means that they shared a common ancestor in the not-too-distant past. This is just one of many pieces of evidence that show we are part of the evolution of life on Earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>Misconceptions About Evolution
</p><p>Today, evolution is still questioned by some people. Often, people who disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it. For example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how life on Earth first began. In fact, the theory explains only how life changed after it first appeared. Some people think the theory of evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes. In fact, the theory suggests humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived several million years ago. These and other misconceptions about evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this fundamental principle of biology.
</p><p>
</p><p>Summary
</p><p>Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since.
</p><p>Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection, presenting a great deal of evidence to support his theory.

(2pts each correct answer.)School from Horne Should Be ImplementedHomeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home. In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID 19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented f the threat of COVID-19. because of thFirst reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to say at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and evaluating its implementation for the reason that homeschooling afollowscurriculum that is approved by Dep DepEd.Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don't want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case ofcovid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadfulabout the health of their children.The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes Instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time plarning and preparing a good learning modality for the saks of the students as Briones said that "Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.​</h2><br />

                            18. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

Parents and My Teachers
is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

The social worker will work with the child welfare agency to identify a suitable foster home for the child. Emergency foster homes are typically licensed and trained families who are available to provide immediate care for children in crisis.</p><p></p><p>The foster family will be responsible for providing a safe and stable environment for the child, meeting their basic needs, and ensuring that any medical or mental health needs are addressed. The foster family will also work with the child welfare agency to develop a plan for the child's long-term care, which may include reunification with their biological family or adoption.</p><p></p><p>During this process, the social worker will continue to monitor the child's well-being and work with the foster family to ensure that the child's needs are being met. The social worker may also provide support and resources to the biological family to address the issues that led to the child's removal and to facilitate reunification if possible.</p><p></p><p>If the child is not able to be reunited with their biological family, the child welfare agency will work to find a permanent placement for the child. This may involve finding an adoptive family or placing the child in a long-term foster care situation.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the process of emergency foster care involves removing a child from their home due to safety concerns, placing them in a temporary foster home, and working with the child welfare agency to develop a plan for the child's long-term care. The goal is to ensure that the child is safe and well-cared for while addressing any underlying issues that led to their removal.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Essay:</p><p>31-40. Long-Term Foster Placement: Long-term foster placement refers to a type of foster care arrangement where a child is placed with a foster family for an extended period of time, with the goal of providing a stable and nurturing family environment until the child reaches adulthood or achieves permanency through adoption, legal guardianship, or reunification with the biological parents. Long-term foster placement is usually considered when it is not possible for the child to be reunited with their biological family, and adoption or legal guardianship is not feasible. In long-term foster care, the foster parents take on a parental role and provide ongoing care, support, and guidance to the child as they grow and develop. The child becomes an integral part of the foster family, and the foster parents are responsible for meeting the child's physical, emotional, and developmental needs. Long-term foster placement aims to provide stability, continuity, and a sense of belonging to the child, and may continue until the child becomes an adult and is ready to transition to independent living.</p><p>41-50. Emergency Foster Care Process: Emergency foster care is a type of foster care placement that occurs when a child is removed from their home due to an immediate crisis or danger, such as abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and requires immediate placement in a safe and secure environment. The process of emergency foster care typically involves the following steps:</p><p></p><p>Removal of the child from their home by a child welfare agency or law enforcement in response to a crisis or danger.</p><p></p><p>Assessment of the child's immediate needs, including physical health, safety, and emotional well-being.</p><p></p><p>Identification of an available and qualified foster family who can provide emergency care for the child.</p><p></p><p>Placement of the child with the emergency foster family, usually on a temporary basis, while the situation with the biological family is assessed and a more permanent plan is developed.</p><p></p><p>Initial screening and orientation of the emergency foster family to ensure their ability to provide appropriate care for the child in crisis.</p><p></p><p>Provision of support services to the child and the emergency foster family, including medical care, counseling, and other necessary interventions.</p><p></p><p>Regular monitoring and supervision by the child welfare agency to ensure the child's well-being and safety in the emergency foster care placement.</p><p></p><p>Development of a case plan and permanency plan for the child, which may involve family reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, or other appropriate options, based on the best interests of the child. </p><p></p><p>Court involvement, including hearings and legal proceedings, to determine the child's legal status and permanency plan.</p><p></p><p>Transition planning for the child, including preparation for potential reunification with the biological family, adoption, or other permanent placement options, depending on the outcome of the case plan and the best interests of the child.</p><p></p><p>The process of emergency foster care is designed to provide immediate safety and care for children who are in crisis situations, while also addressing their physical, emotional, and developmental needs. It involves coordination among various stakeholders, including child welfare agencies, law enforcement, foster families, and the court system, to ensure the well-being and best interests of the child are prioritized throughout the process</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
