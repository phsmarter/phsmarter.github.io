                        <p>When we are reading stories or novels, or when we watch movies, we would read or hear the characters saying, "She said," or "He said," when they talk about what other people said. When we speak, it's the same. We may say, "Ang sabi nga ni..."
</p><p>
</p><p>The speaker's word may be written or spoken in two ways. It could be a direct speech or an indirect speech.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>A direct speech is the exact words said by the speaker. It is usually enclosed into quotation marks (" ").  </strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Examples:  </strong></p><p>(Note: Verbs are underlined)
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Present Tense:</strong> My mom always says, "The world does not revolve around you, my daughter. Love your neighbor."
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Future Tense:</strong> I know that when I go to her place later, my grandma will tell me, "You need to be good girl."
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Past Tense: </strong>She said, "My life is not easy to live because I have a lot of problems."
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>An indirect speech is also saying what the speaker said, only it does not use his or her exact words.  </strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Examples:  </strong></p><p>(Note: verbs are underlined)
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Present tense:</strong> My mom always says that the world does not revolve around me, so I must love my neighbor.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>Future Tense:</strong> I know that when I go to her place later, my grandma will tell me that I need to be a good girl.  </p><p>
</p><p><strong>Past Tense:</strong> She said that her life was not easy to live because she had a lot of problems.
</p><p>
</p><p>If we will analyze the tense, verbs in present and future tense did not change. Only those verbs in past tense are changed.
