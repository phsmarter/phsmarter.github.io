Issue: Viral video of teenagers who had beaten an old man in the jeepney just to steal his purse. •This simple yet devastating crime committed by them is very alarming and the government should lower the criminal liability to 12 years old.(WALA PO ITONG KWENTO)​</a>

The dealonly concerned military camps that already host facilities of Dito rivals Globe Telecomand Smart Communications, said Lorenzana.What is wrong with that argument? Lorenzana grossly fudges the issue by equatingChina Telecom with Globe and Smart, both of which are privately-run companies. ChinaTelecom, on the other hand, is under the control of the Beijing government, which overthe past years has grabbed Philippine territory in the West Philippine Sea, militarized theregion, harassed Filipino fishermen, and unrelentingly undermined Philippine interestsas it has professed friendship and support toward a deferential Duterteadministrationeven5 Facts from the text1.2.3.4.5.5 Opinions after reading the text1.2.3.4.5.❤️</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>HANNBAL BARA</p><p>       The Philippine Muslims was once a dominant group in the country. They have 500 years political history, so far the longest political experience compared to other groups in the whole Philippines. Their culture is a blend of Islam and adat. Adat is the sum of both pre-Islamic culture and the philosophical interpretation of the Muslims on the teachings of Islam. It is itself the lasting contribution of the Philippine Muslims to the country’s national body politic. However, to know the Muslim history, one should understand the role of Islam in bringing about historical development. It is this Islam that actually produced heroic resistance against western colonialism. The Philippine Muslims today became known as cultural communities owing to their culture surviving foreign hegemonism to this day.</p><p></p><br />

Poverty's effects are frequently intertwined, so one problem rarely occurs in isolation. Unemployment and children who are unable to attend school are two examples of the societal effects of poverty.<p>2. Corruption - Corruption undermines our faith in the public sector to act in our best interests. It also wastes our taxes or rates that have been set aside for important community projects, which means we have to accept subpar services or infrastructure or miss out entirely.</p><p></p><p>3. Unemployment - Poverty and hardship, strained relationships, poorer health (though the causal relationships are not always clear), and housing stress are all consequences of unemployment. Unemployment may also have a negative impact on children's development and employment prospects.</p><p></p><p>4. Inflation - Inflation affects the cost of living, the cost of doing business, the cost of borrowing money, mortgages, corporate and government bond yields, and every other aspect of the economy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>h</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>&lt;</strong><strong>3</strong><strong> </strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

When Covid19 wasdeclared as a pandamic by the World Health Organization (WHO), everybody expressed panic in variousbehaviors.This dreadful disease is not a joke after all. It is an invisible enemy nowhere to be found.As early as March 16, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte implemented a lockdown in major cities andprovinces in the Philippines in response to the unfolding of the COVID 19. Panic was very evident andthe president's decision alarmed the whole country to take precautionary measures seriously. Wearingof face mask, thorough washing of hands, and social distancing rules are on top of the listAmidst this health issue, when everyone is expected to stay at home, still many people out there do notfollow the mandated precautionary measures seriously. Disobedience to authorities resulted to moredisagreements between the implementing authorities like the front liners and the ordinary citizens.This dilemma had caused a lot of changes in the life of every individual. The normal way of lifeis hard to perceive at present, but every member of a community can help in this time of pandemic. Inour own simple way, we can contribute in making the new normal life easier and comfortable for all ofus.

Giving ame to our family is the greatest gift we can offer them right now while enjoying eachother's company.

                            29. Top 4 issues in the Philippines Give 1 example within or outside the text How it affects society​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Pollution
Global warming due to the emission of greenhouse gases. ...
Overpopulation. ...
Natural resources depletion. ...
Waste disposal<p><strong>Overpopulation</strong></p><p> in the<strong> Republic of the Philippines</strong> is believed to cause <strong>sustained poverty and poor economic growth</strong> among families by depriving them of the financial resources that are required to secure education and adequate health care for their children </p><p>
</p><p><strong>Some of the issue in the </strong><strong> Philippines </strong></p><p>1. <strong>Obesity:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>obesityStrategic focus: Health
</p><p>
</p><p>Obesity has been on the rise in these modern times. The number of overweight people as well as obese people seems to have increased from the survey that was conducted back in the year 2002. This issue is attributed to the nature of most jobs and the food pattern that is currently in action in our busy society. Unhealthy food habits along with less dedication to workouts have resulted in this obesity problem.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. <strong>Smoking:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>SmokingStrategic focus: Health
</p><p>
</p><p>The percentage of smokers has fallen from about 26.5% in the year 1998 to about 20.8% as observed in a survey that was conducted in the year 2006. As the laws get tougher on smokers, it seems people seem to be quitting this deadly habit.
</p><p>
</p><p>3.<strong> Youth Alcohol Usage:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>Youth Alcohol UsageStrategic focus: Health
</p><p>
</p><p>Among the twelfth graders in one survey, about 49% were found to have consumed alcohol a month before the survey was taken. The worst part of this is that the many parents are unaware of it. In fact, most of the parents don’t seem to have clear and personal talks with their children. This is considered to be one of the big reasons why these youngsters have been pulled into alcohol and drugs.
</p><p>
</p><p>4.<strong> Transportation:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>TransportationStrategic focus: Self-sufficiency
</p><p>
</p><p>Transportation has often been one of the needs that cannot be met for people who live in poverty. This can make the situation worse.
</p><p>
</p><p>5.<strong> Poverty:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>PovertyStrategic focus: Self-sufficiency
</p><p>
</p><p>Midland has recorded the highest number of people who are subject to poverty. The number of deaths due to poverty has seen an exponential rise and the measures taken against the same seem to be moving at a snail pace while the poverty is galloping ahead. This is one social issue that requires immediate attention since the lives of many poverty-struck villages are at bay.
</p><p>
</p><p>6.<strong> Basic Needs:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>Basic NeedsStrategic focus: Self-sufficiency
</p><p>
</p><p>With the exponentially growing population of homeless people, there have been heavy demands for basic needs such as food, housing and also utilities. The worst scenario is that their needs are not being catered to due to acute shortage of the basic amenities.
</p><p>
</p><p>7. <strong>Homelessness:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>HomelessnessStrategic focus: Self-sufficiency
</p><p>
</p><p>Among the world’s many homeless people, about 30% of them are found to be single adults while about 50% of them are adults with families inclusive of children.
</p><p>
</p><p>8.<strong> Homeless Population:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>Homeless PopulationStrategic focus: Self-sufficiency
</p><p>
</p><p>Among all the single homeless people in the world, it is believed that around 22% are suffering from some sort of mental illness, while 22% have been caught with substance abuse such as drug abuse, etc.
</p><p>
</p><p>9. <strong>Teen Violence and Abuse:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>teen violance Strategic focus: Education
</p><p>
</p><p>This is definitely a heart-breaking issue prevalent almost all over the world. Based on a survey, out of the surveyed teenagers, about 30% seemed to have become victims of physical abuse and 29% were subject to violence.
</p><p>
</p><p>10. <strong>Teen Depression and Suicide:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>depression teenStrategic focus: Education
</p><p>
</p><p>At number ten, we have teen depression and suicide ruling the teen community. The reasons for depression are many, but the result has unanimously ended in depression and attempted suicides. According to rough statistics, it is said that about 27% of teenage kids have been driven into depression, of which 16% are found to be girls and 11% are boys.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Here are some examples of the top issues in the Philippines, along with one example of how each issue affects society:</p><p></p><p>1. <strong>Poverty</strong> - Poverty remains one of the most pressing issues in the Philippines, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line. This issue affects society in many ways, including limiting access to education, healthcare, and other basic necessities, as well as contributing to crime and social unrest.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Corruption</strong> - Corruption is a major problem in the Philippines, with many government officials and institutions being accused of engaging in unethical practices. This issue affects society by eroding trust in government and undermining the rule of law, leading to a lack of accountability and transparency in public institutions.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Education</strong> - Education is an important issue in the Philippines, with many students lacking access to quality education due to poverty, inadequate facilities, and other factors. This issue affects society by limiting opportunities for personal and economic growth, leading to a less-skilled workforce and a less competitive economy.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Environmental degradation</strong> - The Philippines is facing significant environmental challenges, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change. This issue affects society by threatening the health and well-being of the population, as well as contributing to the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of natural resources that are essential to the country's economy and way of life.</p><br />
