Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

It refers to the dramatic increase in the annual average global surface temperature of the earth. Many scientists predict that this rapid change in temperature will most likely bring changes to our climate. The rainfall distribution will change and the frequency of severe weather events like typhoons will increase. Our weather patterns will undergo a profound change. It will also cause sea levels to rise and low-lying coastal areas to experience heavy floods. It is also predicted to affect the crops we grow and may even lead to decrease in crop production.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Global warming, caused by the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is one of the most significant environmental challenges facing the world today. It is causing melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events, leading to devastating effects on ecosystems and human lives. The use of renewable energy resources can play a crucial role in reducing the effects of global warming.</p><p></p><p>Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions. When used to generate electricity, they emit fewer pollutants such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which are the main culprits behind global warming. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy can help to mitigate climate change and its harmful effects.</p><p></p><p>The use of renewable energy also reduces our dependence on fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These non-renewable resources are the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing our consumption of fossil fuels, we can reduce our carbon footprint and slow down global warming.</p><p></p><p>Renewable energy sources are also essential in encouraging energy efficiency. For instance, solar and wind power are most effective when used in conjunction with energy-efficient appliances, lighting, and building designs. By promoting energy efficiency, we can reduce our energy consumption and, in turn, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p></p><p>In addition to mitigating climate change, the use of renewable energy sources can also create green jobs. The renewable energy industry has the potential to create many new jobs, particularly in the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy technologies. This job creation can help to support local economies and reduce dependence on foreign sources of energy.</p><p></p><br />

To prevent our environment from the harmful effects of global warming, we must restoring our ecosystem. Man has been exploiting natural resources without giving the environment anything in return. This needs to be stopped. We must all join forces to make this world a better place for our future generations who deserve this planet as much as we do. The basic step that we can follow to increase the overall health of our planet is planting trees. Afforestation should be our primary goal. The earth can become a better place if we pledge to plant as many trees as we can in our lifetime.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>https://www.aplustopper.com/paragraph-on-global-warming/</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Being able to write an essay is an integral part of mastering any language. Essays form an integral part of many academic and scholastic exams like SAT, UPSC amongst many others. It is a crucial evaluative part of English proficiency tests as well like IELTS, TOEFL, etc. We can say that essays help an individual in presenting their views distinctly and vividly for the entire world to assess. They also present a person’s analytical thinking and enable a person to fluently express their opinions. Major essays are meant to emphasize issues of concern that can have significant consequences on the world. In this blog, we seek to explore the skills needed and learn how to write an essay on global warming.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth’s average surface temperature over the past century, primarily due to the greenhouse gases released by people burning fossil fuels. The greenhouse gases consist of methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and chlorofluorocarbons. The weather prediction has been becoming more complex with every passing year, seasons more indistinguishable, and the general temperatures hotter. The number of hurricanes, cyclones, droughts, floods, etc., has risen steadily since the onset of the 21st century. The supervillain behind all these changes is Global Warming. The name is quite self-explanatory; it means the rise in the temperature of the Earth.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps you tysm pa brainliest</p><br />

                            10. write an essay regarding the possible ways by which you can help to lessen the effect of global warming​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Global warming is one of the most pressing environmental issues that our world is facing today. It is a phenomenon wherein the Earth's temperature rises due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily caused by human activities. As individuals, we have the responsibility to help lessen the effects of global warming by making small changes in our daily lives. In this essay, I will discuss the possible ways by which we can contribute to the fight against global warming.</p><p></p><p>One of the most effective ways to lessen the effects of global warming is by reducing our carbon footprint. Carbon footprint refers to the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are emitted as a result of our daily activities, such as transportation, electricity usage, and food consumption. We can reduce our carbon footprint by choosing to walk or bike instead of driving, turning off the lights when we leave a room, and using energy-efficient appliances. We can also reduce our carbon footprint by eating a plant-based diet and reducing our consumption of meat and dairy products, which are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p></p><p>Another way to help lessen the effects of global warming is by conserving water. Water conservation is important because energy is required to pump, transport, and treat water. By reducing our water usage, we can help reduce the amount of energy required to provide clean water to our homes and communities. We can conserve water by taking shorter showers, fixing leaks in our faucets and toilets, and watering our lawns and plants only when necessary.</p><p></p><p>We can also help lessen the effects of global warming by supporting renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, do not emit greenhouse gases and are therefore much better for the environment. By supporting renewable energy sources, we can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help promote a cleaner, more sustainable future.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, we can help lessen the effects of global warming by promoting environmental awareness and advocacy. We can educate ourselves and others about the importance of taking action to reduce our carbon footprint and conserve our natural resources. We can also participate in environmental advocacy campaigns and support policies and legislation that promote sustainable practices and protect our planet.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, global warming is a serious issue that requires the collective effort of individuals, communities, and governments around the world. As individuals, we can do our part to help lessen the effects of global warming by reducing our carbon footprint, conserving water, supporting renewable energy sources, and promoting environmental awareness and advocacy. By taking action now, we can help ensure a cleaner, more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.</p><br />

                            13. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike.

                        <p>Being able to write an essay is an integral part of mastering any language. Essays form an integral part of many academic and scholastic exams like SAT, UPSC amongst many others. It is a crucial evaluative part of English proficiency tests as well like IELTS, TOEFL, etc. We can say that essays help an individual in presenting their views distinctly and vividly for the entire world to assess. They also present a person’s analytical thinking and enable a person to fluently express their opinions. Major essays are meant to emphasize issues of concern that can have significant consequences on the world. In this blog, we seek to explore the skills needed and learn how to write an essay on global warming.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth’s average surface temperature over the past century, primarily due to the greenhouse gases released by people burning fossil fuels. The greenhouse gases consist of methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and chlorofluorocarbons. The weather prediction has been becoming more complex with every passing year, seasons more indistinguishable, and the general temperatures hotter. The number of hurricanes, cyclones, droughts, floods, etc., has risen steadily since the onset of the 21st century. The supervillain behind all these changes is Global Warming. The name is quite self-explanatory; it means the rise in the temperature of the Earth.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps you tysm, pa brainliest</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Hello there, Khirk!  I apologize, we cannot do that here.  We can only give you some tips on how to make a scientific essay.</p><p></p><p>Commonly, an essay is composed of three paragraphs which are the introduction, body, and the conclusion.  However, in your case, you were given a task to have a 5-paragraph essay; hence, the 3 major parts are excluded.</p><p></p><p>In a paragraph, usually, has 3-7 sentences; depending on the likes of the instructor or the likes of yours—because we have what we call writing style, originality is.  Additionally, an outline technique is important in making a good essay, because this is when you brainstorm all the necessary information.</p><p></p><p>To make a scientific paragraph, normally, you must have a opening statement, main idea, supporting details, and examples.</p><p></p><p>The "opening statement" (or known as the thesis statement) is a statement where your essay is all about.  For example, "The Global Warming on Earth."  It must be a general thought or a broad topic that must be elaborated.  More likely a title, but...nah.</p><p></p><p>The "main idea" is the supporting idea on the opening statement.  This is where the outline technique will begin.  You will specify the information related to your statement.  For example, "Global warming deflates the ozone layer on Earth."  In this part, you have started a good topic about global warming, and that relates to the ozone layer deflation.  You can have several main idea as long as it does not affect the required number of essay.</p><p></p><p>The "supporting details" are the back-ups of your main idea.  This is where a more specific explanation shall be given.  For example, "As the ozone layer decreases, climate change will be affected and Earth's temperature might rise unimaginably."  More supporting details, much better.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the "Examples."  These are the back-up of the supporting details; but, not actually backing-up, they are just an idea that made creatively; to be understood very clearly.  Although, I think, having an example is not really important, because I could not give examples on my example supporting detail.</p><p></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Opening statement &lt;-- Main idea &lt;-- Supporting details &lt;-- Examples</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since it is a scientific essay, a specific (or straight-to-the-point) information is needed; no more story telling happen.  Statistical information (numerical) and informative sentences are the types to be considered.</p><p></p><p>I guess those are all?  I hope these help.  I am really sorry, I cannot give you the specific answers about these.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: I have indicated one example as your main idea; however, it is just an idea, you must revise it.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns are referred to as climate change. These movements may be natural, but human activity have been the primary cause of climate change since the 1800s, mostly owing to the combustion of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and gas), which creates heat-trapping gases.</strong></p><p><strong>Droughts that are more frequent and extreme, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and warmer oceans may directly injure animals, ruin their habitats, and devastate people's livelihoods and communities. Dangerous weather events are becoming increasingly common or severe as climate change progresses.</strong></p><p><strong>Reduce your driving. ...</strong></p><p><strong>Increase your recycling. ...</strong></p><p><strong>Examine your tires. ...</strong></p><p><strong>Reduce your use of hot water. ...</strong></p><p><strong>Products with a lot of packing should be avoided. ...</strong></p><p><strong>You should adjust your thermostat. ...</strong></p><p><strong>Consider planting a tree.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming The greenhouse effect is the exchange of incoming and outgoing radiation that warms the earth. This occurs when the suns energy reaches the earth and its reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed. Global Warming is the gradual heating of earths surface, oceans and atmosphere. What causes greenhouse effect and global warming, is it harmful to humans, and what can we do to help it, can it be reversed? Greenhouse gases are natural gases, like methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas. As temperatures raise water is evaporated from rivers, oceans, reservoirs, and soil. In result air is warmer and humidity is higher holding more water</p><br />

After reading the text, copy the graphic organizer below in your pape and supply the missing items. CAUSE EFFECTS Global warming is one of the major environmental issues facing the world today. It refers to the dramatic increase in the annual average global surface temperature of the earth. Many scientists predict that this rapid change in temperature will most likely bring changes to our climate. The rainfall distribution will change and the frequency of severe weather events like typhoons will increase. Our weather patterns will undergo a profound change. It will also cause sea levels to rise and low-lying coastal areas to experience heavy floods. It is also predicted to affect the crops we grow and may even lead to decrease in crop production. Increase in the temperature of the Earth Decrease in crop production​</h2><br />
