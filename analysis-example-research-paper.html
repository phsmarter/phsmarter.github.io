The final research report where a discussion of findings and limitation ispresented is the easiest part of a research.2. Research methods can be selected by a researcher prior to formulating theresearch objectives.3. Most areas of study have to deal with processes that involve experimentations,tests, and research.4. Quantitative data will tell you what your respondents are doing, while qualitativedata offers deeper insight into why.5. Quantitative research is original, systematic and objective research that collectsnumerical data and uses logic and statistical analysis to verify hypothesis.6. A researcher should explore the characteristics of the data and the examinedvariables to summarize the data once it is reliable and ready for investigation.7. Quantitative research uses statistics to generalize a finding.8. The first step for a researcher after finishing data collection is to start hypothesistesting procedures.9. Research analysis is the last critical step in the research process.10. A valid research refers to the degree to which it accurately measures what itintends to measure.11. The final research report where a discussion of findings and limitations ispresented is the easiest part of a researcher.12. Through the sharing of research we continue to learn more about the patternsand rules that guide the ways we communicate.13. “Which café or coffee shop do you go to the most often”? This is an example ofquantitative question.14. Quantitative data is easier to measure using statistical analysis15. Qualitative: relating to, measuring, or measured by the quality of something(size, appearance, value, etc.) rather than its quantity​</a>

                                            Read the following paragraphs and analyze whether the paraphrase is an example of an effective paraphrase or not. Write your analysis in the space provided. The original passage: Students frequently overuse direct quotation in taking notes, and as a result they overuse quotations in the final [research] paper. Probably only about 10% of your final manuscript should appear as directly quoted matter. Therefore, you should strive to limit the amount of exact transcribing of source materials while taking notes. Lester, James D. Writing Research Papers. 2nd ed. (1976): 46-47. Paraphrased 1 In research papers students often quote excessively, failing to keep quoted material down to a desirable level. Since the problem usually originates during note taking, it is essential to minimize the material recorded verbatim (Lester 46-47). Paraphrased 2 Students often use too many direct quotations when they take notes, resulting in too many of them in the final research paper. In fact, probably only about 10% of the final copy should consist of directly quoted material. So it is important to limit the amount of source material copied while taking notes. ​</a>

                                            Activity 2: Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of DocumentPurpose of the ReviewWriter’s PersonaIntended ReaderStrengthsWeaknesses​</a>

1. The Concept paper is a document summary that can give a deep analysis
about a idea, theory, or thought.
2. Concept Research must be done with the quickest amount of time while
retrieving the Informative and Objective information.
3. Paper Outlining requires you to choose a topic that is important to not only
your paper but also your course.
4. Topic Refinement means that a paper must be written with an introduction,
body, and conclusion.
Topic Refinement means that the research possibilities must be limited so as
not to be seen as too much.
6. Paper Editing and revision must be done by looking for contradictions in
one’s research for major problems.
7. Introduction is where the submission date is included.
8. Informal definition makes use of one paragraph at the minimum.
9. Explication makes use of information arranged from a general abstract idea
to real and specific examples.
10. Background/Rationale states the importance of the project.</a>

                                            Activity 2: Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strongmethodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced. Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only-begotten ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due tologistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size. In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it. There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of Document:_____Purpose of the Review:_______Writer’s Persona:_____Intended Reader:_____Strengths:_____Weaknesses:______​</a>

The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing.

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.
This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.
Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal.
It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts.
The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.
In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.

Research methods can be selected by a researcher prior to formulating theresearch objectives.3. Most areas of study have to deal with processes that involve experimentations,tests, and research.4. Quantitative data will tell you what your respondents are doing, while qualitativedata offers deeper insight into why.5. Quantitative research is original, systematic and objective research that collectsnumerical data and uses logic and statistical analysis to verify hypothesis.6. A researcher should explore the characteristics of the data and the examinedvariables to summarize the data once it is reliable and ready for investigation.7. Quantitative research uses statistics to generalize a finding.8. The first step for a researcher after finishing data collection is to start hypothesistesting procedures.9. Research analysis is the last critical step in the research process.10. A valid research refers to the degree to which it accurately measures what itintends to measure.11.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Training of a page, an esquire, and a knight:</p><p>A page was a young boy who began his training in a noble household at around the age of seven. He learned how to read and write, basic math, and social skills. He also learned how to ride horses and care for them, as well as how to hunt and use weapons. He served the lord and lady of the household and learned etiquette and manners.</p><p>An esquire was the next rank up from a page and usually started their training around the age of 14. They learned more advanced combat skills, such as jousting, sword fighting, and archery, as well as strategy and tactics. They also learned about chivalry and how to serve their lord and lady with honor and loyalty.</p><p>A knight was the highest rank and usually achieved around the age of 21. They were expected to be expert warriors and also uphold the ideals of chivalry, such as bravery, loyalty, and honor. They were expected to protect the weak and innocent and fight for justice and righteousness.</p><p>The aspects of training that are relevant to our youth include learning basic skills, such as reading and writing, as well as social skills, such as etiquette and manners. Youth can also benefit from learning about teamwork, leadership, and loyalty, as well as developing physical skills and discipline through activities like sports or martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Chivalry as an ideal may not be as prevalent today as it was in medieval times, but its principles of honor, loyalty, and selflessness are still relevant and can be applied in modern contexts. Examples of chivalrous behavior could include standing up for someone who is being bullied, being honest and fair in one's dealings, and serving others in need.</p><p></p><p>A critique is a systematic analysis of a piece of literature, film, or other media that evaluates its worth and validity. It is not merely informational, but rather aims to persuade the reader of the writer's assessment. A critique typically includes the following elements:</p><p></p><p>Title, author, and date of publication or release</p><p>Outline of the main ideas and thesis of the work</p><p>The writer's own thesis statement and main idea about the work</p><p>Analysis of what the writer likes and dislikes about the work, with specific examples to support their assessment</p><p>Assessment of whether the author or creator achieved their intended goal, such as informing or entertaining the audience</p><p>Evaluation of the work's focus, clarity, persuasiveness, originality, and other relevant factors</p><p>In writing a critique, it is important to approach the work objectively and provide evidence to support one's assessment. A critique can be a useful tool for evaluating and improving one's own writing or other creative endeavors.</p><p></p><br />

                            14. Activity 2: Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of DocumentPurpose of the ReviewWriter’s PersonaIntended ReaderStrengthsWeaknesses​</h2><br />

1. The Concept paper is a document summary that can give a deep analysis
about a idea, theory, or thought.
2. Concept Research must be done with the quickest amount of time while
retrieving the Informative and Objective information.
3. Paper Outlining requires you to choose a topic that is important to not only
your paper but also your course.
4. Topic Refinement means that a paper must be written with an introduction,
body, and conclusion.
Topic Refinement means that the research possibilities must be limited so as
not to be seen as too much.
6. Paper Editing and revision must be done by looking for contradictions in
one’s research for major problems.
7. Introduction is where the submission date is included.
8. Informal definition makes use of one paragraph at the minimum.
9. Explication makes use of information arranged from a general abstract idea
to real and specific examples.

                            25. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</h2><br />
