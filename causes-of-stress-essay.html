You may modify the sample outline format presented before. (You may use another sheet of paper for your answer) STRESS AND STRAIN In engineering, stress and strain describe the conditions of a material under varying circumstances Stress is the material's resistance to external forces, measured in terms of the force exerted per unit of area, and strain is the material's change resulting from those external forces. Every force that acts on a material creates a type of stress, and each stress has an accompanying type of strain. The three basic types of stress are tensile, compressive, and shearing. Tensile stress occurs when a pair of forces acts on opposite ends of the material and attempt to pull it apart. The resistance the material offers to this action is known as the tensile stress in the material Tensile stress is most easily demonstrated by pulling on the ends of a rubber band. The type of stretching (strain) taking place in the rubber band occurs to some degree in all other materials which are this type of force. Compressive stress results from forces pushing in on the ends of a material. A simple example of a compressive force is pressure exerted to push an accordion together. An accordion has only a small compressive stress because the accordion bag offers little resistance to being forced together Reduction is the length of the material (strain) accompanies a compressive stress Shearing stress occurs when a force acts downward on a material, causing a piece of it to bend on break off. This type of force, known as shearing force, is resisted by shearing stress Shearing force and stress be demonstrated by slicing a loaf of bread. Although amplied by the knife's cutting edge, the force can still be considered a shearing force. Like all other materials the bread offers resistance (stress) but tends to break (strain) under such force. ​</a>

                                            11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

There is not enough evidence and information to state a final decision. Among other possible causes, the researchers name regular personal depressions and stresses associated with the family conflicts overloaded homework schedule, and problems with girlfriends/boyfriends." ​</a>

                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</a>

                            1. Essay writing Directions: Give at least three cause of stress and effects to a student.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Stress is a common experience for many students. There are several causes of stress that can affect a student's physical and mental health. In this essay, I will discuss three causes of stress and their effects on students.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, academic pressure is a significant cause of stress among students. The pressure to succeed academically can lead to anxiety, sleep disorders, and depression. The pressure to maintain good grades, the pressure to excel in extracurricular activities, and the pressure to get accepted into prestigious colleges can all contribute to academic stress. The effect of academic pressure can be manifested through physical symptoms like headaches, stomach aches, and fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, personal relationships can also cause stress among students. Relationship problems with friends or family members can lead to emotional distress, anxiety, and depression. Students who have difficulty balancing their relationships with their schoolwork often experience stress. The effect of relationship stress can lead to poor academic performance and a lack of motivation.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, financial issues can also be a cause of stress among students. The cost of tuition fees, textbooks, housing, and other academic expenses can create financial stress. Financial stress can lead to emotional distress, sleep disorders, and an inability to concentrate on academic work. Students who work part-time jobs to pay for their expenses can experience stress from balancing their work and school schedules.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, stress is a common experience for many students. Academic pressure, personal relationships, and financial issues are some of the main causes of stress. The effects of stress on students can lead to physical symptoms, emotional distress, poor academic performance, and a lack of motivation. It is important for students to find ways to manage their stress and seek support from friends, family, and school resources.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>waking up early,  many homeworks, sleepy.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learn to recognise the signs that you are becoming stressed</p><p></p><p>There are a wide range of possible signs and symptoms that may be associated with stress. These include headaches, stomach upsets and indigestion, and sleep problems. Many people also find they become very emotional and have trouble regulating their emotions.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, most of these signs are fairly non-specific: that is, they may be associated with many different illnesses and conditions. It can therefore be hard to identify when your symptoms are the result of stress. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Look after yourself physically</p><p></p><p>When you are physically fit and well, it is much easier to cope with stress.</p><p></p><p>When you become stressed, it is harder to motivate yourself to care about what you eat, or whether you exercise. However, not doing so can also make you more stressed. Get into good habits while your stress levels are fairly low, and you may find that they never go up again. These ‘good habits’ include:</p><p></p><p>Taking regular exercise</p><p></p><p>Stressful situations increase the level of stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol in your body.</p><p></p><p>These are the “fight or flight” hormones that evolution has hard-wired into our brains and which are designed to protect us from immediate bodily harm when we are under threat.  However, stress in the modern age is rarely remedied by a fight or flight response. Physical exercise can be used as a surrogate to metabolise the excessive stress hormones and restore your body and mind to a calmer, more relaxed state.</p><p></p><p>Try to incorporate some physical activity into your daily routine on a regular basis, either before or after work, or at lunchtime. Regular physical activity will also improve the quality of your sleep.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Factors that affect the promotion of good mental health are varied and complex. Some of the most important factors include a healthy diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, and the development of strong social connections. Other key factors include effective stress management techniques, such as mindfulness practices, deep breathing, and regular relaxation exercises. Additionally, avoiding drugs and alcohol, as well as limiting exposure to stressful situations, can also promote good mental health. Ultimately, the key to promoting good mental health is to engage in a variety of activities and practices that foster physical, emotional, and social well-being.</p><p></p><p>Stress is a normal and inevitable part of life, and it is often a natural response to challenging situations. In fact, some degree of stress can be beneficial, as it can help us stay alert, focused, and motivated. However, chronic or excessive stress can have negative impacts on both our physical and mental health. It is important to recognize when stress has become excessive or unmanageable, and to take steps to reduce its impact on our lives. Effective stress management techniques can include exercise, meditation, relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends or family members. By recognizing the normalcy of stress, we can work to manage it more effectively and maintain our mental and physical health.</p><br />

Whether it's difficulties in a romantic relationship, conflicts with friends and family members, or issues at work, relationship problems can take a toll on a person's mental health and well-being.</p><p></p><p>In addition, chronic health conditions can also cause stress and anxiety.

(You may use another sheet of paper for your answer) STRESS AND STRAIN In engineering, stress and strain describe the conditions of a material under varying circumstances Stress is the material's resistance to external forces, measured in terms of the force exerted per unit of area, and strain is the material's change resulting from those external forces. Every force that acts on a material creates a type of stress, and each stress has an accompanying type of strain. The three basic types of stress are tensile, compressive, and shearing. Tensile stress occurs when a pair of forces acts on opposite ends of the material and attempt to pull it apart. The resistance the material offers to this action is known as the tensile stress in the material Tensile stress is most easily demonstrated by pulling on the ends of a rubber band. The type of stretching (strain) taking place in the rubber band occurs to some degree in all other materials which are this type of force. Compressive stress results from forces pushing in on the ends of a material. A simple example of a compressive force is pressure exerted to push an accordion together. An accordion has only a small compressive stress because the accordion bag offers little resistance to being forced together Reduction is the length of the material (strain) accompanies a compressive stress Shearing stress occurs when a force acts downward on a material, causing a piece of it to bend on break off. This type of force, known as shearing force, is resisted by shearing stress Shearing force and stress be demonstrated by slicing a loaf of bread. Although amplied by the knife's cutting edge, the force can still be considered a shearing force. Like all other materials the bread offers resistance (stress) but tends to break (strain) under such force. ​</h2><br />

Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

                            15. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress.
