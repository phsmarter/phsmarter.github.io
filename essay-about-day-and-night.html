                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

                                            where the conclusion of essay? almost perpendicular, while more submissive wolves lower themselves before dominant pack members. These lower class members often have their tails tucked between their legs (Primate). A wolf that has been defeated in a fight can avoid being attacked by its victorious companion by taking a posture similar to that of a pup begging for food (University of Oklahoma Press 91). Wolves must communicate at all times when they are hunting. They have to work together to catch most of their food (due to the size of the food that they hunt). The concept that wolves use is called the "Pincer Attack" (Baily 91). When using the pincer attack, the pack splits in two groups and surround the prey (mostly deer, sheep, and other medium-sized mammals). One of the groups causes a diversion, while the other half ambushes the helpless prey. Wolves can move quickly and quietly. Many of them operate on stamina rather then on sudden bursts of speed (Baily 85). Because of the cooperation of the group, when it comes to hunting, the pack usually ends up victorious, and they have enough food for a couple of days. If they pack gets a big kill, then the leader will have the next strongest male guard the kill during the night to keep off other animals. Like other animals, wolves communicate with a social ladder. They have one dominant male (usually the leader of the pack) (Primate). This wolf has many responsibilities. He has to make sure that all the other wolves don't get out of line, and makes sure that there is harmony among the group. The pack leader does this by barking at the other wolves and fighting with the other males. Normally, the pack leader will not fight with the females of the pack unless it is necessary (Timberwolf). With the leader comes a dominant female. Together they are known as the breeding pair. These two are in charge of the pack, raising the young, selecting denning areas and rendezvous sites, capturing food, and maintaining the pack's territory (Primate). These two wolves are also responsible for the offspring. Not many of the other wolves mate for offspring because that is the dominant pair's job. Every year the dominant pair will produce one litter of pups. These pups take the place of the older wolves that are too old to hunt. Because the pack is so close and they communicate all the time, many of the other female wolves help the dominant female with taking care of the young (Wolfhaven). The dominant female will assign each pup to an older female. This helps the other females learn how to be a mother, and it helps the dominant female so she can hunt and not have to worry about taking care of her young. If only humans could communicate as well as wolves, today's society would be wonderful. Wolves' methods of communication are simple and usually resolve conflicts without violence. Wolves have been living together for many, many years so they must be doing something right. Maybe we can learn something from the wolves instead of trying to make them extinct. 233​</a>

                            6. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time
Essay Topic: Learning at Home during Lockdown: My
Parents and My Teachers
is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

                            12. where the conclusion of essay? almost perpendicular, while more submissive wolves lower themselves before dominant pack members. These lower class members often have their tails tucked between their legs (Primate). A wolf that has been defeated in a fight can avoid being attacked by its victorious companion by taking a posture similar to that of a pup begging for food (University of Oklahoma Press 91). Wolves must communicate at all times when they are hunting. They have to work together to catch most of their food (due to the size of the food that they hunt). The concept that wolves use is called the "Pincer Attack" (Baily 91). When using the pincer attack, the pack splits in two groups and surround the prey (mostly deer, sheep, and other medium-sized mammals). One of the groups causes a diversion, while the other half ambushes the helpless prey. Wolves can move quickly and quietly. Many of them operate on stamina rather then on sudden bursts of speed (Baily 85). Because of the cooperation of the group, when it comes to hunting, the pack usually ends up victorious, and they have enough food for a couple of days. If they pack gets a big kill, then the leader will have the next strongest male guard the kill during the night to keep off other animals. Like other animals, wolves communicate with a social ladder. They have one dominant male (usually the leader of the pack) (Primate). This wolf has many responsibilities. He has to make sure that all the other wolves don't get out of line, and makes sure that there is harmony among the group. The pack leader does this by barking at the other wolves and fighting with the other males. Normally, the pack leader will not fight with the females of the pack unless it is necessary (Timberwolf). With the leader comes a dominant female. Together they are known as the breeding pair. These two are in charge of the pack, raising the young, selecting denning areas and rendezvous sites, capturing food, and maintaining the pack's territory (Primate). These two wolves are also responsible for the offspring. Not many of the other wolves mate for offspring because that is the dominant pair's job. Every year the dominant pair will produce one litter of pups. These pups take the place of the older wolves that are too old to hunt. Because the pack is so close and they communicate all the time, many of the other female wolves help the dominant female with taking care of the young (Wolfhaven). The dominant female will assign each pup to an older female. This helps the other females learn how to be a mother, and it helps the dominant female so she can hunt and not have to worry about taking care of her young. If only humans could communicate as well as wolves, today's society would be wonderful. Wolves' methods of communication are simple and usually resolve conflicts without violence. Wolves have been living together for many, many years so they must be doing something right. Maybe we can learn something from the wolves instead of trying to make them extinct. 233​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In conclusion, wolves are intelligent and social animals that rely on communication and cooperation to survive. They have a hierarchical structure within their pack, with a dominant male and female in charge of the group's activities, including hunting, raising offspring, and maintaining the pack's territory. Wolves use various communication methods, including body language and vocalizations, to convey information and resolve conflicts without violence. Their success in living together for many years can serve as a model for human society to learn from, rather than trying to make them extinct. Understanding and appreciating these magnificent creatures can help us protect them and the ecosystems they live in.</p><br />
