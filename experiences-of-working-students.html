Lived Experiences of On-Campus Working Students (Frigillano et al., 2015)Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus.This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gatheringinformation about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage,mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financialproblem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. Theyexperienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite workpressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, withhigh self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants'dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthesestudents, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.2.

                        <p>In my opinion, experience of working students will have an effect on their performance at school. For example, if students get tired while studying, then they might do poorly on tests and assignments. This could lower their grade point average (GPA). Also, some students who work long hours after classes end, might miss out on social activities such as going to parties, hanging around with friends, watching movies, etc., thereby lowering GPA.</p><br />

                        <p>work immersion is a struggle for students to cope up with a new and unfamiliar environment. it will be hard for the students to learn things they thought would be easy for them. realizations will be present throughout their experience. it will also cause stress in terms of working for their desired profession and school works at the same time.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The lived experiences of working students in their academic standing/performance is a significant topic of study as it sheds light on the challenges and struggles faced by students who have to juggle work and school simultaneously. This study can help identify the factors that affect the academic performance of working students, such as time management, work-life balance, financial constraints, and mental and physical exhaustion. By understanding these factors, academic institutions and employers can work together to develop policies and programs that can help support working students in achieving their academic goals.</p><p></p><p>The benefits of this study can be varied, both for the students themselves and for the academic institutions and employers. For students, this study can provide insights into the experiences of their peers and can help them develop strategies for balancing work and school responsibilities. Additionally, the study can help academic institutions identify the areas where they can provide additional support to working students, such as offering flexible scheduling, financial aid, or academic counseling. Employers can also benefit from this study by understanding the impact that work can have on a student's academic performance and identifying ways to accommodate working students while still meeting business needs. Ultimately, this study can help create a more supportive and inclusive academic and work environment for all students, including those who work while studying.</p><br />

Lived Experiences of On-Campus Working Students (Frigillano et al., 2015)Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus.This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gatheringinformation about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage,mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financialproblem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. Theyexperienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite workpressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, withhigh self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants'dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthesestudents, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.2.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>My physical and emotional health suffered but my grades did not. Focusing on my studies gave me a visible sign of success. I needed something I could control and grades provided that for me. The research perspective I learned in classes also made me feel more in control at doctor and therapy appointments. Around Finn's third birthday, he reached age level on all developmental and physical tasks. I transitioned from being a caregiver to "just" a parent. The shift was profound. It had a significant impact on my lived experience as a parent, my lived experience as a student, and my lived experience of health. The worry that consumed me, and the exhaustion I felt as a caregiver dissipated when my role was reduced to parent. I was able to focus on my studies in a more balanced way and I had the energy to build relationships with fellow students in my program. I have the benefit of understanding the experience of being a student as both a caregiver and as a non-cargegiver. My personal experience as a student caregiver, combined with my academic path in student affairs, sowed the seeds for this phenomenological study</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps, make me as a brainliest</p><br />

It can help to write down your thoughts.</strong></p><p><strong>For example: My family just moved, so I switched to a new school in the middle of the year. The stressful parts are not knowing anyone, missing my old friends, and dealing with all new schoolwork.</strong></p><p><strong>Notice and name the feelings you have about the situation. Accept your feelings — it's understandable to feel the way you feel, given your situation. It can help to write down your feelings, too.</strong></p><p><strong>For example: I feel lonely and sad because of missing old friends and my old school. I'm mad that we had to move, especially now. I'm worried about keeping up in math and social studies. I feel left out because I'm the new kid. I guess anyone would feel this way if they were in my situation.</strong></p><p><strong>Learn more. Learn all you can about the situation you're dealing with. This might include reading about it, talking to others, or finding out what others in your situation have done and what to expect.
