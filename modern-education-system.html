                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

The conception of education and of what an educated man is varies in response to fundamental changes in the details and aims of society. In our country and during this transition stage in our national life, what are the qualities which an educated man should possess? Great changes have takes place in the nature of our social life during the last forty years. The contact with the Americans and their civilization has modified many of our old customs, traditions and practices, some for the worse and many for the better. The means of communication have improved and therefore better understanding exists among the different sections of our country. Religious freedom has developed religious tolerance in our people. The growth of public schools and establishment of democratic institutions have developed our national consciousness both in strength and in solidarity. With this growth in national consciousness and national spirit among our people, we witness the corresponding rise of a new conception in education- the training of an individual for the duties and privileges of citizenship, not only for his own happiness and efficiency but also for national service and welfare. In the old days, education was a matter of private concern; now it is a public function, and the State not only has the duty but it has the right as well to educate every member of the community- the old as well as the young, women as well as non- not only for the good of the individual but also for the self-preservation and self protection of the State itself. Our modern public school system has been established as a safeguard against the shortcomings and dangers of the demoustic governinent and democratic institutions. In the light of the social changes, we come again to the question: What qualities should distinguish the educated Filipino today? I venture to suggest that the educated Filipino should, first, be distinguished by the power to DO! The Oriental excels in reflective thinking; he is a philosopher. The Occidental is a doer; he manages things, men and affairs The Filipino of today needs more of his power to translate reflection into action. I belleve that we are coming more and more to the conviction that no Filipino has the right to be considered educated unless he is prepared and ready to take un active and useful part of the work, life, and progress of our country as well as in the progress of the world."​</a>

Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.​</a>

                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

Covid-19 has put different adjustments in many aspects worldwide. However, despite the global impact that this pandemic has brought, things must continue even in a way that we never imagined before. That includes the system of education not just here in the Philippines but in other parts of the world. Education must continue, but this time, in a not-so- traditional setup. Addressing all the questions on how classes will take place amidst health and economic crisis, the Department of Education (DepEd) announced the implementation for the first time, of so-called "Blended Learning". This assures that education continues without putting the safety of the teachers and the learners on the line. In doing so, we must be adept with the use of modern technology. The department is also aware of the students' scarcity of resources such as desktops, laptops, and other gadgets. Internet connectivity in the country is also a thing to consider. With these, DepEd started the printing of self- learning modules. These are all unconventional, but with discipline coupled with determination and patience, everything is possible. No pandemic can stop the Filipino youth from learning​</a>

                            5. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

The conception of education and of what an educated man is varies in response to fundamental changes in the details and aims of society. In our country and during this transition stage in our national life, what are the qualities which an educated man should possess? Great changes have takes place in the nature of our social life during the last forty years. The contact with the Americans and their civilization has modified many of our old customs, traditions and practices, some for the worse and many for the better. The means of communication have improved and therefore better understanding exists among the different sections of our country. Religious freedom has developed religious tolerance in our people. The growth of public schools and establishment of democratic institutions have developed our national consciousness both in strength and in solidarity. With this growth in national consciousness and national spirit among our people, we witness the corresponding rise of a new conception in education- the training of an individual for the duties and privileges of citizenship, not only for his own happiness and efficiency but also for national service and welfare. In the old days, education was a matter of private concern; now it is a public function, and the State not only has the duty but it has the right as well to educate every member of the community- the old as well as the young, women as well as non- not only for the good of the individual but also for the self-preservation and self protection of the State itself. Our modern public school system has been established as a safeguard against the shortcomings and dangers of the demoustic governinent and democratic institutions. In the light of the social changes, we come again to the question: What qualities should distinguish the educated Filipino today? I venture to suggest that the educated Filipino should, first, be distinguished by the power to DO! The Oriental excels in reflective thinking; he is a philosopher. The Occidental is a doer; he manages things, men and affairs The Filipino of today needs more of his power to translate reflection into action. I belleve that we are coming more and more to the conviction that no Filipino has the right to be considered educated unless he is prepared and ready to take un active and useful part of the work, life, and progress of our country as well as in the progress of the world."​</h2><br />

Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.​</h2><br />

                        Answer:<br />Education is a platform in which young generations are trained and make them future-ready. Education provides knowledge and skills which help the person to be employable. The Indian education system is very popular and diversified among other countries’ education systems due to its change in the evolution from ancient to the modern education system. During the ancient and medieval periods of education, students were trained by teachers in such a manner that they can survive and live in that era. After independence, there is a tremendous growth in the Indian education system providing teaching and training in all aspects, but it does not satisfy the global demands of the market. This chapter focuses on teaching methodology, curriculum, characteristics, methods of learning, aims of the Indian education system during the ancient and medieval period and how it differed in today’s modern education and what are the things that our today’s modern education need to learn and implement from ancient and medieval education. The mentioned points are used to differentiate ancient, medieval, and modern education with advantages and disadvantages. Through this chapter, students, teachers will get to know the difference in the education system and what else to be adapted in the future to overcome all the problems.<br /><br />Explation:<br />Sanamakatulong<br /><br /><br />

                            21. - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.
