Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

                                            Background Any biological organisms that are not originally found in certain locality are known as invasive species or alien species. Since they are not considered to be native members of a certain population, they could alter the ecological and evolutionary mechanism in the community by competing against environmental requirements or affecting the possible gene flow of those populations that originally inhabiting a certain locale. Situation A certain Filipino agriculture community reported cases of new species that are commonly found in their area. Examples are trees and shrubs found in the highland community forest or new types of freshwater animals that serve as predators in the native fauna of lakes and streams in the community. Generally, these invasive species serve as a threat to the local community but unfortunately, people within the community are unaware of the serious effects of these invasive species. Therefore, a collective citizen science is necessary and as an expert about evolutionary mechanisms and relationships, you are requested to draft a position paper that will be addressed to the local community and policy makers. Task Select one alien species that are already reported in the Philippines. Explain why this was considered as an invasive species and what was the usefulness or harmfulness it had gave in a certain Filipino community. Afterwards, write a local action plan that you will propose to the local policy makers how you are going to inform the general public on a possible long-term impact of these alien species.​</a>

Answer the 5-item application test below. --------------------------------- LESSON OVERVIEW: What is a time zone? - A time zone is a region of the globe where the same standard time is used. How many time zones are there in the world? - There are 24 time zones in the world, each representing a different hour of the day. How to calculate the time difference between two cities in different time zones? - The time difference between two cities in different time zones can be calculated by subtracting the time of the first city from the time of the second city. If the result is POSITIVE (+), it means the second city is ahead of the first city in terms of time. If it is NEGATIVE (-), then the second city is behind the first city in terms of time. How to calculate the actual time in a given city? - Add or subtract the time difference from the given time in the other city. What is PST? - Philippine Standard Time DIFFERENCES OF THE TIME IN CERTAIN PLACES FROM PHILIPPINE STANDARD TIME (PST): Seoul, South Korea (+1) Beijing, China (SAME) New York, USA (-12) Cairo, Egypt (-6) Canberra, Australia (+2) Athens, Greece (-5) Examples: 1) If PST is 6:30 am, what time is it in Seoul, South Korea? - The time difference of Seoul, South Korea from PST is +1 hour, then; 6:30 am + 1 hour = 7:30 am. Therefore, the time in Seoul, South Korea is 7:30 am. 2) If PST is 8:45 pm, what time is it in Athens, Greece? - The time difference of Athens, Greece from PST is -5 hours, then; 8:45 pm - 5 = 3:45 pm Therefore, the time in Athens, Greece is 3:45 pm.

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

                            8. Background Any biological organisms that are not originally found in certain locality are known as invasive species or alien species. Since they are not considered to be native members of a certain population, they could alter the ecological and evolutionary mechanism in the community by competing against environmental requirements or affecting the possible gene flow of those populations that originally inhabiting a certain locale. Situation A certain Filipino agriculture community reported cases of new species that are commonly found in their area. Examples are trees and shrubs found in the highland community forest or new types of freshwater animals that serve as predators in the native fauna of lakes and streams in the community. Generally, these invasive species serve as a threat to the local community but unfortunately, people within the community are unaware of the serious effects of these invasive species. Therefore, a collective citizen science is necessary and as an expert about evolutionary mechanisms and relationships, you are requested to draft a position paper that will be addressed to the local community and policy makers. Task Select one alien species that are already reported in the Philippines. Explain why this was considered as an invasive species and what was the usefulness or harmfulness it had gave in a certain Filipino community. Afterwards, write a local action plan that you will propose to the local policy makers how you are going to inform the general public on a possible long-term impact of these alien species.​</h2><br />
