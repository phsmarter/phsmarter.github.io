                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

From learning about the structure of the atom to the different types of energy, I have developed a greater understanding and appreciation for the world around me.</p><p></p><p>I have learned the basics of how atoms are structured and how they interact with each other. I have studied the differences between chemical and physical changes and learned how to identify them. I have studied the properties of different types of energy, such as potential and kinetic energy. I have also studied topics such as Newton’s Laws of Motion and Bernoulli’s Principle.</p><p></p><p>I have also learned about the scientific method. I have studied the steps required to conduct an experiment, such as forming a hypothesis, gathering materials, conducting the experiment, and drawing conclusions. This has taught me how to think critically and logically and has given me the skills to approach any problem with a scientific mindset.</p><p></p><p>I have also learned about the different types of tools and techniques used to study the natural world.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reflection is the change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the reflection of light, sound and water waves. The law of reflection says that for specular reflection the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. Mirrors exhibit specular reflection.</p><p><strong>Explanation: Sorry po kung hindi ito 100 words</strong></p><p></p><br />

Writeyour answer on a separate sheet of paper.Social Issue/ ProblemImportance of using the social sclencesperspective in addressing the social issue orproblem​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The difference between Society and Nature is that Nature is greater than Society and it precedes Society in the sense that Nature is pristine, whereas Society is a Human Construction i.e. Society belongs to Nature, but Nature does not belong to Society in that a Society cannot exist without Nature, but Nature can exist without Society (Far in the uninhabited jungle, for example). Nature and Society are Teleologically related.</p><p></p><p>Society is the Social Construction of a collection of Homo Sapiens living or existing in close proximity, so that a particular physical territory might accommodate various different Societies, Groups or Collections of Humans. The term Society has also been lent to Groups of other Sentient Beings such as Primates, but less so to the Lesser Developed Species such as dogs, lions or cats or insects, such as ants — where the term Colony seems more apt.</p><p></p><p>In certain parts of the world there is an existence of a biosphere supporting Life other than Homo Sapiens and we do not expect to find a Society there. Primates exist in the jungle and their Groups have often been referred to as Societies of Apes or Monkeys but that is strictly not a true Society per se, because it is less highly developed or differentiated in comparison to that of Homo Sapiens or Man and for that reason it is more apt perhaps to describe such Primate gatherings as Troops or Groups.</p><p></p><p>Human Society is a highly differentiated collection of Individuals coexisting usually in peace and co-operation by following an evolved body of fixed rules, as even found to exist among Primitive Man i.e. Natural Equitable Rules of Living.</p><p></p><p>Nature per se is Primary and Pristine and Existence is based on the “Survival of the Fittest” and (Darwinian) Natural Selection and Adaptation, where the Law is based on “Tooth and Claw” superiority (Lex Talionis). In contradistinction, Living in a Society is a more sophisticated existence governed by consensual Social Conventions, Rules and Law.</p><p></p><p>All Societies are part of Nature but not all Nature is Society — Nature is the greater.</p><br />

                            7. The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.
