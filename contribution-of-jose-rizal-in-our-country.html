Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

Do you think that the story is still relevant in our society today? Why or why not? (2pts.)</p><p>Yes, I definitely think that the story of Noli Me Tangere is still relevant in our society today. Despite being published over 130 years ago, many of the issues and themes presented in the novel are still relevant in modern society, such as social injustice and inequality, corruption, oppressive government, and colonization. It also serves as an important reminder of our history as well as the people who fought for our independence and laid the foundations for a brighter future. </p><p></p><p>2. If you could talk to the author of the novel "Noli Me Tangere", what questions will you ask or what would you like to tell him? (3pts.) </p><p>If I could talk to the author of the novel "Noli Me Tangere", I would first like to thank him for his work and his commitment to his craft. I would also ask him what inspired him to write the novel, and if he believed that his work would still be relevant today. Finally, I would be interested to hear his reflections on how the issues presented in the novel have changed, and what he would like to see for the future of the Philippines. </p><p></p><p>3. What do you think are the contributions of Jose Rizal's novel to our country? List at least five. (5pts.)</p><p>1. The novel served as a call to action for Filipino people, inspiring the Philippine Revolution for independence and setting the groundwork for the development of a distinct Filipino identity. </p><p>2. It raised awareness about the issues of colonialism, oppression, and racism, which still have relevance in modern society. </p><p>3. It sparked dialogue and discussion about topics that have been traditionally seen as taboo and opened the door to broader conversations about governmental and societal issues. </p><p>4. It challenged oppressive authorities and sparked a revulotion against Spanish rule.</p><p>5. It provided readers with an insightful look into the culture and history of the Philippines and serves as an important reminder of our heritage.</p><br />
