                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ethics, morality, and law are concepts that people often confuse or use interchangeably. However, they have different meanings and purposes. <strong>Ethics</strong> refer to personal values and principles that guide behavior, while <strong>morality</strong> encompasses a wider range of social norms and religious beliefs. <strong>Law</strong>, on the other hand, is a set of rules and regulations that the government enforces. These concepts are related but not identical. What is legal may not always be ethical or moral, and vice versa. It is important for individuals and society to understand the differences and navigate their interactions towards a fair and just society.</p><p></p><br />

                        Question:<p>What moral lesson have you gained from the narrative essay The Boy Who Looked for God?</p><p></p>Answer:<p></p>There once was a little boy who wanted to meet God. He knew it was a long trip to where God lived, so he packed his suitcase with Twinkies and a six-pack of root beer and started his journey. When he had gone about three blocks, he met an old woman. She was sitting in the park just staring at some pigeons.<p></p>The boy sat down next to her and opened his suitcase. He was about to take a drink from his root beer when he noticed that the old lady looked hungry, so he offered her a Twinkie. She gratefully accepted it and smiled at him. Her smile was so pretty that the boy wanted to see it again, so he offered her a root beer. Once again she smiled at him. The boy was delighted! They sat there all afternoon eating and smiling, but they never said a word.<p></p>As it grew dark, the boy realized how tired he was, and he got up to leave but before he had gone more than a few steps, he turned around, ran back to the old woman and gave her a hug. She gave him her biggest smile ever. When the boy opened the door to his own house a short time later, his mother was surprised by the look of joy on his face. She asked him, “What did you do today that made you so happy?” He replied, “I had lunch with God.” But, before his mother could respond, he added, “You know what? She’s got the most beautiful smile I’ve ever seen!”<p></p><strong>Explanation:</strong>Moral: God is everywhere.  We just need to share our happiness and make others smile to feel him.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An ethical dilemma for parents is whether to monitor their teens’ social media activities. Teens spend a large part of their day online engaging in behaviours that have implications for their health and well-being.
</p><p>
</p><p>It’s important to set the ground rules when you as a parent first give a smartphone, tablet, computer, or other electronic devices to a teen, including that they will be monitored until they are old enough to understand their obligations online.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>It’s important to have conversations with teens to be sure they’re aware of the warning signs and what to do when they feel a predator is in their midst.
</p><p>
__________________________________________________________
</p><p>The case for monitoring
</p><p>The key issue is to teach your teen responsible behaviour and that actions have consequences. The following lists good arguments for monitoring.
</p><p>
</p><p>‧ Communicating with a teen about social media limitations can build responsible behaviour and they learn to be accountable for their actions.</p><p>
</p><p>‧ Monitoring their behaviour can help deal with problems such as sexting and cyberbullying that can be harmful to their growth and development.</p><p>
</p><p>‧ Monitoring can help to control predatory behaviour that threatens a teen’s well-being.</p><p>
</p><p>‧Discussing online behaviours can be used as a teachable moment to explain what’s meant by respecting others and how online behaviours promote civility in relationships.
</p><p>__________________________________________________________</p><p>Reasons not to monitor
</p><p>There are a few good reasons for not monitoring as follows.
</p><p>
</p><p>Teens have a right to privacy and may not want their parents to see everything they do on social networking sites; they may perceive it to be invading their sacred online space.
</p><p>Trusting parents is a key issue in strengthening the bond between teen and parent.
</p><p>Teens may wonder what else parents are monitoring; do they follow them on dates, for example, especially at younger ages?
</p><p>Returning to the original question: Should parents monitor teens’ online activities? If you are a parent, the benefits of doing so and protecting your kids against harmful behaviours outweigh the costs.
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, privacy and trust are important issues to teens, and they may not understand why you have chosen to ignore these. Still, you are the parent and should provide guidance for your teen in navigating the sometimes choppy waters online.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ask yourself: How would you feel if you didn’t monitor those activities and your teen became the target of a predator or was cyberbullied

The 2019 Polls: The Debates​</h2><br />
                        Why we need rain?<p></p><p>Rain is needed as a source of fresh water, which is essential for the survival of humans, plants and animals. Rain fills aquifers, lakes and rivers, maintaining the lives of living organisms. ... Rain is essential because it removes the need for transporting water inland and desalination activities.</p><p></p>Rising HIV cases <p>Several factors put the Philippines in danger of a broader HIV/AIDS epidemic. They include increasing population mobility within and outside of the Philippine islands; adverse to publicly discussing issues of a sexual nature; rising levels of sex work, casual sex, unsafe sex, and injecting drug use.</p><p></p>The Need for Moral Recovery<p>The Senator continues to promote her "moral recovery program." The program emphasizes that people must have the right values concerning discipline, hard work, love of country, and sense of common good. FP is a moral decision of couples to limit the number of children, which affects the destiny of the nation.</p><p></p>Flying with a Firefly<p>As a family we travelled to Italy last summer and booked our flights through EasyJet. This was our first flight with Miss S, who has Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy. Initially, we thought we would need to take Miss S’s big, bulky car seat on board the flight to enable her to travel. After speaking to EasyJet’s Special Assistance however, we learnt that they were happy for the GoTo seat to be used on the aircraft. Now in the knowledge we could use Miss S’s GoTo seat on board our flight, it suddenly made the whole experience feel less daunting and all the more accessible to us. It certainly put our minds at rest that she would be secured safely and she would be comfortable in her own seat. We now no longer faced the headache of trying to figure out how her car seat was going to fit. EasyJet were not only very happy for us to use the GoTo seat, they were happy for us to take anything Miss S needed to make our journey as comfortable as possible. </p><p></p>The 2019 Polls: The Debates<p>In all forms of competitions, there will always be a promising candidate with no hope of winning due to misconceptions or unpopularity. In the global arena, debates have been proven to be the best avenue to set candidates on an even footing, especially during elections.</p><p></p><p>Commission on Elections’ Director for Education and Information James Jimenez recently sat on an international debate symposium for the coming mid-term elections in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>He said that incumbents may be missing a golden opportunity by dodging debates.</p><p></p><p>“Some studies have shown that incumbents who take the opportunity to articulate their policies are actually more likely to pull in voters at the polls,” Jimenez wrote in a tweet posted late Thursday.</p><p></p><p>This was true in the 2016 presidential elections where most of the incumbents who were running for higher office lost to local politicians aiming for national posts.</p><p></p><p>meaning po ba?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>because rain give us a lot of thing like our plant help us give water </p><br />

                            26. What is the conclusion of the essay regarding the Korean's stand on traditional morality?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Significant changes have occurred in recent times to the structure and dynamics of family life in Korea, yet some of the old patterns persist. In terms of structure, Korean families are very similar to those of Western countries. But Koreans' attitudes differ greatly from those of Westerners because of the society's dualistic mentality. For instance, Korean society includes both progressive and conservative trends, coexisting with the Western and Asian mentalities; a dual class system with the emergence of the middle and the poor classes alongside a very powerful rich class; a division among the generations, as with individualism of the younger generations nurtured on Western culture and the traditional patriarchy of older generations; and a duality between family centered on the relationships of couples and children and society composed of collective families centered on adults. Finally, Korean society shows discrepancies between action and mindset.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT'S HELP</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What is the moral of "Cinderella"? There are several morals, or lessons, that help explain the meaning of the story "Cinderella." A moral is a lesson the story teaches about how to behave in the world. Fairy tales often have clear morals about how to live a good life, and Charles Perrault would even include his own at the end of each story to make his intended message clear to readers.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>"Cinderella" is a fairy tale by French author Charles Perrault, originally published in his 1697 collection "Tales of Mother Goose." Although Perrault's version of "Cinderella" (or "Cendrillon" in French) is one of the most popular, this is not the only version of "Cinderella," nor is it the original version. The story was told as an oral folktale with versions in several cultures for centuries before Perrault's version was published (and his was not the first published version, either). However, Perrault's version added three iconic elements to the story: glass slippers, a pumpkin carriage, and a fairy godmother.</p><p>The story's protagonist is Cinderella, a girl who lives with her father, stepmother, and stepsisters (her own mother has died). After her mother's death, Cinderella's father remarried a woman who at first seemed kind, but turned out to be nasty once the marriage was complete. The stepmother and stepsisters treat Cinderella poorly and make her do all the chores (Cinderella is a rude nickname her sisters came up with, based on the cinders from the fireplace, where she would go to rest after she finishing cleaning). Conversely, Cinderella treats others with kindness. The prince of their kingdom invites all maidens to a ball, but the stepmother and stepsisters forbid Cinderella from attending. A fairy godmother appears and provides Cinderella with a carriage, horses, a ball gown, and glass slippers, so that she can attend in a disguise her family will not recognize. However, the magic will end at midnight (except the glass slippers), so she must leave by then. The prince dances with Cinderella and falls in love with her, but she runs away at midnight before he can learn how to find her again, leaving one glass slipper behind.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Fifteen and Pregnant" is a television movie that premiered in 1998, directed by Sam Pillsbury and written by Susan Cuscuna and Cynthia Mandelberg. The movie portrays the challenges faced by a teenage girl, Tina, who becomes pregnant at the age of fifteen. The story takes place in the late 1990s and touches on the delicate issue of teen pregnancy, its impact on the individual, family, and society.</p><p></p><p>Tina faces numerous challenges throughout the movie. Her unexpected pregnancy affects her education, social life, and personal relationships. She is forced to confront the harsh reality of being a young mother, including the financial burden and social stigma associated with teenage pregnancy. Tina's emotional turmoil is evident as she struggles to come to terms with her situation and make difficult decisions.</p><p></p><p>The movie also portrays the challenges encountered by Tina's family. Her parents are devastated by the news of their daughter's pregnancy and struggle to come to terms with the situation. They face financial constraints, as Tina's mother quits her job to take care of her daughter and the baby. The family also experiences social ostracization, as they face judgment and criticism from the community.</p><p></p><p>However, the family copes with these challenges by supporting each other. Tina's parents put their differences aside and come together to support their daughter. They provide her with the emotional and financial support she needs to make informed decisions. Tina's boyfriend, Paul, also plays a significant role in her life, supporting her throughout her pregnancy and helping her make important decisions.</p><p></p><p>The moral lesson of the movie is that teenage pregnancy can have significant and long-lasting consequences. The movie highlights the importance of responsible sexual behavior and the need for open communication between parents and their children. It also shows the importance of family support in overcoming challenges and the power of love and understanding in difficult times.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "Fifteen and Pregnant" is a compelling movie that tackles a sensitive issue in society. It portrays the challenges faced by a teenage girl and her family as they navigate through an unexpected pregnancy. The movie underscores the importance of responsible sexual behavior and the need for family support during difficult times.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The fine line between obeying the law and not obeying it. Obeying the law kind of makes the world safer. When you don't obey a law and therefore caught doing the crime; you will be charged and possibly sentenced to a place where you are no longer free to do as you please. When you obey the law you get to do as you please with your life as long as you follow the laws. Laws are put into motion to create a safe environment for everyone to live in. No one should have to be worried about their lives</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong</p><p>pa brainliest po salamat</p><br />
