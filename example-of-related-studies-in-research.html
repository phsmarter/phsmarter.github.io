                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What are study limitations?</p>Every study has limitations. Study limitations can exist due to constraints on research design or methodology, and these factors may impact the findings of your study. However, many researchers are reluctant to discuss the limitations of their study in their papers, feeling that bringing up limitations may undermine its research value in the eyes of readers and reviewers.<br />

                        <p>1. Summary of Qualitative Research Techniques</p><p>Qualitative research is an approach that is used to gain insight into people's thoughts, opinions, and experiences. It involves the use of interviews, observations, and focus groups to collect data. The data collected is analyzed and interpreted to draw conclusions. The main goal of qualitative research is to understand the underlying reasons and motivations behind human behavior.</p><p></p><p>2. Three Specific Techniques Used in Qualitative Research </p><p>a. Interviews: Interviews are conversations between the researcher and the participant. The goal is to gain an understanding of the participant's experiences, attitudes, and beliefs. Interviews can be conducted face-to-face, over the phone, or online. </p><p>b. Observations: Observations involve the researcher watching and recording the behavior of the participants. The goal is to understand how people interact with each other and their environment. Observations can be done in natural settings, such as homes or workplaces, or in controlled settings, such as a laboratory. </p><p>c. Focus groups: Focus groups involve a group of people discussing a particular topic. The goal is to gain insight into the opinions and attitudes of the group. Focus groups can be conducted in person or online.</p><p></p><p>3. Potential Application of Qualitative Research </p><p>In the field of education, qualitative research can be used to gain insight into the experiences and attitudes of students, teachers, and administrators. For example, a researcher might conduct interviews with students to understand their experiences with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This information could be used to improve online learning programs and make them more effective.</p><p></p><p>4. Example of Qualitative Research in the Real World </p><p>A study conducted by Grol-Prokopczyk (2019) used qualitative research to understand the experience of women who did not have children. The study found that these women faced social stigma and pressure to conform to societal expectations. The implications of this research are that society needs to be more accepting of women who choose not to have children.</p><p></p><p>5. Discussion Questions </p><p>1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using qualitative research in comparison to quantitative research?</p><p>2. How can qualitative research be used to improve policies and programs in various industries?</p><p>3. What ethical considerations need to be taken into account when conducting qualitative research?</p><p>4. How can researchers ensure that their own biases do not influence the interpretation of qualitative data?</p><p>5. What role can technology play in the collection and analysis of qualitative data?</p><br />
