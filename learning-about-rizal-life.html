                                            Summarize the Story in 5-10 sentencesTHE HEROISM OF BERNARDO CARPIOOnce upon a time, there was a couple who lived in one of the many mountains of San Mateo, Rizal. The man and the woman were very poor and led a very hard life. But one day, amidst all their poverty and hardships, came a bundle of joy and happiness. The man and the woman were given the gift of the birth of a big, beautiful, and healthy baby boy. They named their newborn son Bernardo Carpio and he became his parents’ most precious treasure.Like any other kid, Bernardo loved to play. But something was noticeably very different about Bernardo. Unlike the other kids, Bernardo had the power of extraordinary strength.It was said that when Bernardo was still a baby crawling on all fours, all the floorboard nails that he hooked with his tiny fingernails were pulled out from their very places. When Bernardo was still learning how to walk, any railing that he used for support was destroyed and splintered into pieces. And anytime Bernardo’s parents gave him a new toy to play with, the toy would break and become crushed in the palms of his small hands.As Bernardo grew up to be a handsome young man, his power doubled and increased even more. He soon became renowned not only for his power of extraordinary strength, but also for his dashing good looks. Furthermore, Bernardo possessed great courage and bravery that were second to none. Everyone knew that Bernardo could easily beat any man so no one would dare face Bernardo Carpio in a match of strength and bravery.Not like other typical guys, Bernardo was not interested in merriment, social gatherings, and other festivities. The loveliness of all the beautiful young women in his town did not appeal to him. What really captivated Bernardo was the forest.Bernardo found his real happiness in the forest. The part where the trees were the thickest and the densest is where he often stayed. There is where he spent time with and sought the company of his close friends, the animals of the forest.In the forest that Bernardo frequented lived an enchanted creature. This enchanted creature was a very big and a very strong male. However, the creature also had the ugly manner of envying and causing harm to others. The enchanted creature had seen Bernardo many times during the innumerable visits that he had made to the forest.It did not take long before the begrudging and hateful enchanted creature got wind of Bernardo’s fame for his extraordinary strength. The enchanted creature was sure that the young man would be no match against his own power and strength. One day, the enchanted creature waited for Bernardo to come into the forest. As soon as he saw Bernardo, he immediately challenged him to a duel. Bernardo was not one to back down from any fight so he accepted the challenge right away.And so the two fought. This was followed by many different battles in which both of them made use of their power of great strength. And in every single one of them, the enchanted creature lost.They separated after a long and arduous battle. The enchanted creature left but not without hatred in his heart for the one that defeated him. He waited for the right time and the right opportunity to exact revenge on Bernardo for the loss and shame that he had suffered in his hands.When the enchanted creature was able to chance upon Bernardo once again, he invited him to a hidden area of the forest. In that area were two enormous slabs of stone that were positioned on either side of the place. In the middle of those two stone slabs was where the enchanted creature dwelled. The creature told Bernardo to go ahead and enter the place. As soon as Bernardo reached the spot right in the center of the two stones, the enchanted creature vanished into thin air. And suddenly, the two stone slabs started to fall towards Bernardo. Using his extraordinary strength, Bernardo fought against the stones’ massive weight and size to prevent them from crushing him.According to the elders, Bernardo Carpio is still in the same place, holding those two stones. And every time an earthquake occurs, it is said that it is because of Bernardo Carpio moving and wishing to break free.I'm very sorry that this is Long</a>

                        <p>My learning insight about life and works of Rizal is that he was a man of extraordinary <strong>intellectual</strong> powers, with <strong>artistic</strong> talent, excelled in such <strong>broad</strong> <strong>fields</strong> of thought as medicine, poetry, sketching, architecture, sociology and others. The Philippines honors him as our national hero.</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p>Rizal's death by the Spanish colonial rulers when he was very young was a <strong>great loss </strong>for the Philippines and the world at large. Today, Filipinos honor him as our national hero. In May 1882, Jose Rizal took a ship to Spain without telling his parents. He enrolled at the Universidad Central de Madrid.</p><p></p><p>In June 1884, he received his <strong>medical</strong> <strong>degree</strong> at the age of 23 and the following year, he also graduated from the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy. Inspired by the desire to cure his mother's blindness, Rizal next went to the University of Paris and then the University of Heidelberg to complete further studies in ophthalmology. In Heidelberg, he studied under the famous professor Otto Becker. Rizal completed his second doctorate at Heidelberg in 1887.</p><p></p><p>In both his novel and newspaper editorials, Jose Rizal calls for a number of reforms from the Spanish colonial system in the Philippines. He advocated <strong>freedom</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>speech</strong> and assembly, <strong>equal</strong> <strong>rights</strong> before the law for Filipinos, and the appointment of Filipino <strong>leaders</strong>. In addition, Rizal asked the Philippines to become a province in Spain, with representation in the Spanish legislature (Cortes generales). Rizal once called for independence for the Philippines. Despite this, the colonial government considered him a dangerous radical, and declared him an enemy of the state.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> the Rizal's law contending Groups(positive feedback of Rizal law):</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18425298</p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                            7. Summarize the Story in 5-10 sentencesTHE HEROISM OF BERNARDO CARPIOOnce upon a time, there was a couple who lived in one of the many mountains of San Mateo, Rizal. The man and the woman were very poor and led a very hard life. But one day, amidst all their poverty and hardships, came a bundle of joy and happiness. The man and the woman were given the gift of the birth of a big, beautiful, and healthy baby boy. They named their newborn son Bernardo Carpio and he became his parents’ most precious treasure.Like any other kid, Bernardo loved to play. But something was noticeably very different about Bernardo. Unlike the other kids, Bernardo had the power of extraordinary strength.It was said that when Bernardo was still a baby crawling on all fours, all the floorboard nails that he hooked with his tiny fingernails were pulled out from their very places. When Bernardo was still learning how to walk, any railing that he used for support was destroyed and splintered into pieces. And anytime Bernardo’s parents gave him a new toy to play with, the toy would break and become crushed in the palms of his small hands.As Bernardo grew up to be a handsome young man, his power doubled and increased even more. He soon became renowned not only for his power of extraordinary strength, but also for his dashing good looks. Furthermore, Bernardo possessed great courage and bravery that were second to none. Everyone knew that Bernardo could easily beat any man so no one would dare face Bernardo Carpio in a match of strength and bravery.Not like other typical guys, Bernardo was not interested in merriment, social gatherings, and other festivities. The loveliness of all the beautiful young women in his town did not appeal to him. What really captivated Bernardo was the forest.Bernardo found his real happiness in the forest. The part where the trees were the thickest and the densest is where he often stayed. There is where he spent time with and sought the company of his close friends, the animals of the forest.In the forest that Bernardo frequented lived an enchanted creature. This enchanted creature was a very big and a very strong male. However, the creature also had the ugly manner of envying and causing harm to others. The enchanted creature had seen Bernardo many times during the innumerable visits that he had made to the forest.It did not take long before the begrudging and hateful enchanted creature got wind of Bernardo’s fame for his extraordinary strength. The enchanted creature was sure that the young man would be no match against his own power and strength. One day, the enchanted creature waited for Bernardo to come into the forest. As soon as he saw Bernardo, he immediately challenged him to a duel. Bernardo was not one to back down from any fight so he accepted the challenge right away.And so the two fought. This was followed by many different battles in which both of them made use of their power of great strength. And in every single one of them, the enchanted creature lost.They separated after a long and arduous battle. The enchanted creature left but not without hatred in his heart for the one that defeated him. He waited for the right time and the right opportunity to exact revenge on Bernardo for the loss and shame that he had suffered in his hands.When the enchanted creature was able to chance upon Bernardo once again, he invited him to a hidden area of the forest. In that area were two enormous slabs of stone that were positioned on either side of the place. In the middle of those two stone slabs was where the enchanted creature dwelled. The creature told Bernardo to go ahead and enter the place. As soon as Bernardo reached the spot right in the center of the two stones, the enchanted creature vanished into thin air. And suddenly, the two stone slabs started to fall towards Bernardo. Using his extraordinary strength, Bernardo fought against the stones’ massive weight and size to prevent them from crushing him.According to the elders, Bernardo Carpio is still in the same place, holding those two stones. And every time an earthquake occurs, it is said that it is because of Bernardo Carpio moving and wishing to break free.I'm very sorry that this is Long</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda or Jose Rizal was a physician and novelist, born in the Spanish colony, Filipinas as a “creole” (half Filipino, half Spanish). Rizal wrote extensively about the abuses of Spanish colonizers to the Philippines, fighting to reveal their atrocities and inspiring a whole generation towards freedom, therefore becoming the Philippines’ national hero.</p><p>Rizal may have died on December 30, 1896, at the tender age of 35, but much more of him than his remains in Rizal Park lies in the hearts of Filipinos. He inspired the independence movement because he provided a mirror to the sick colonial society that Filipinas had become as a result of Spanish colonization.</p><p>Here’s what you can learn from his life and implement in your own work sphere:</p><p>Against all odds</p><p>Rizal manifested the highest virtues being a Filipino. He struggled and won in the face of the most arduous situations, and inspired the Katipunaneros to revolt, and thereby helped found the first independent Republic of Asia.</p><p><strong>Focus on your goal(s)</strong></p><p>Fighting injustice in society was Rizal’s sole motto. Night and day, all he dreamed of was to free fellow Filipinos. Rizal became a leader of the reformist movement called Propaganda, an unwavering campaign for political and social freedoms. He wrote unceasingly for the La Solidaridad and even wrote two novels to reveal the atrocities of the Spanish colonials. These led to his assassination, but he died a hero.</p><p>Keep personal life away from work</p><p>While we do not live in such tumultuous times as Rizal's, it is important to keep distractions away from every workday. Rizal was so focused on the work that he did not allow loved ones or even his own preferences or emotions come in the way.</p><p><strong>Pride of representing a brand</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a model, actor, sportsperson or lead any kind of glamorous existence in order to own representation of your employer. If you work for a company, you’re automatically their face. Your values, hard work and personal ethics play an important part in its growth. So be proud and own it responsibly. Rizal too read extensively to prove the merit of the pre-colonization culture of Filipino.</p><p><strong>Use your time to the fullest</strong></p><p>Rizal spent much of his time in self-improvement via self-education. Not only was he busy academically, but he also learned sculpture, painting, languages including German, and kept up with the latest conversations globally in philosophy and science. Even in exile in Dapitan (a remote town in Mindanao), he used his time in cataloging the local animal kingdom and plants to share with fellow revolutionists.</p><p>You too can take a leaf from his life and become a better version of yourself every day. Whether by taking an online or after-hours course at the local university, acquiring a new hobby, or being part of a hobby circle, or even just reading instead of spending hours in front of your (not-so-) smart tv or phone!</p><p><strong>There’s a virtue in giving</strong></p><p>Rizal always led a frugal existence, including staying hungry at meals to pay rent and skipping outings to stay on track with his medical education. In Dapitan, even though he won the lottery, he relinquished all his winnings to build light and water infrastructure, and a school for fellow citizens, where he taught as well as offered free medical treatment.</p><p></p><br />
