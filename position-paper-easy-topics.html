                        <p>Title / Proposition: The Burial of Ferdinand Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani is Unjustifiable</p><p></p><p>I. Introduction</p><p>Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has been a controversial figure in Philippine history. He was responsible for numerous human rights violations, the infamous mass killings and torture of his critics, and the corruption and theft of billions of dollars from the Philippine treasury. Despite these atrocities, there has been an ongoing debate on whether or not he deserves to be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, which is an act of honor for war heroes and national leaders. The thesis of this paper is that Ferdinand Marcos does not deserve to be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani or receive any form of honor from the government.</p><p></p><p>II. Body</p><p>A. The Counterclaim</p><p>One of the arguments is that Marcos has the right to be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani because he served as a former president and veteran during World War II. Moreover, some people consider him as a hero who fought for the country's development and prosperity.</p><p></p><p>B. The Argument</p><p>However, these arguments are weak, as the evidence against Marcos's atrocities is overwhelming. He was ousted from the presidency in 1986 through a peaceful revolution called EDSA People Power, which exposed his dictatorship that lasted for more than two decades. The evidence of his human rights violations, corruption, and theft is well-documented, and the people who suffered under his regime continue to seek justice and reparations.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Marcos's service as a Philippine veteran during World War II does not excuse his crimes against the Filipino people. The Libingan ng mga Bayani is reserved for those who have served the country honorably and sacrificed their lives for the nation. Marcos's dictatorship, theft, and human rights violations are not acts of valor for the country, but rather a betrayal of the principles of democracy and justice.</p><p></p><p>III. Conclusion</p><p>In conclusion, it is unjustifiable for Ferdinand Marcos to be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani or receive any honor from the government. The evidence of his atrocities is undeniable, and he should be held accountable for his actions. The death of a person does not erase the damage they have caused to society, and he should not be given a hero’s burial. The government should respect the victims of his dictatorship and promote justice as a fundamental value of the country.</p><br />
