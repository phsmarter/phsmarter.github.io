He loves to go to a garden and look for different insects and birds and capture them using his camera Ben uses his eyes to look for birds and insects. What his eyes are really doing is taking light input and converting it into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.

The brain then interprets these signals and converts them into a visual image which is how Ben sees the birds and insects in the garden. Not only does Ben's brain give him a visual image, but it also categorizes what Ben sees, so he immediately thinks, There are birds and insects in the garden. The working force of the nervous system that do all of these things that allow Ben to see those birds and insects and recognize them are called neurons.

                            30. B. Let's Understand Direction Take a look at the picture. Read and analyze the short story below the answer the questions that follow Activity 2-Read and Understand This is Ben. He loves to go to a garden and look for different insects and birds and capture them using his camera Ben uses his eyes to look for birds and insects. What his eyes are really doing is taking light input and converting it into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. Ben's eyes are sensory organs or organs which are devoted to gathering sensory input, and sending it to the brain. The brain then interprets these signals and converts them into a visual image which is how Ben sees the birds and insects in the garden. Not only does Ben's brain give him a visual image, but it also categorizes what Ben sees, so he immediately thinks, There are birds and insects in the garden. The working force of the nervous system that do all of these things that allow Ben to see those birds and insects and recognize them are called neurons. Neurons are specialized cells of the nervous system that transmit signals throughout the body.Discussion Questions 1. What part of your body is considered the main control station? 2. How are messages sent through your body to and from your brain?3.What are nerve cells or neurons?  4.What do you think are the parts of your body that are included in your nervous system?5. How do these nerve cells make connections within the brain and relay messages? 6. How do you think your body react when it feels pain?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. What part of your body is considered the main control station? </p><p></p><strong>answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The brain</strong><strong>The brainThe brain is the control center and the spinal cord is the major highway carrying messages to and from the brain.</strong><p></p><p>2. How are messages sent through your body to and from your brain? </p><p></p><strong>answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>When neurons communicate, the neurotransmitters from one neuron are released, cross the synapse, and attach themselves to special molecules in the next neuron called receptors. Receptors receive and process the message, then send it on to the next neuron. 4. Eventually, the message reaches the brain.</strong><p></p><p>3. What are nerve cells or neurons? </p><p></p><strong>answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Neurons (also called neurones or nerve cells) are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between.</strong><p></p><p>4. What do you think are the parts of your body that are included in your nervous system?</p><p></p><strong>answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system: The brain and the spinal cord are the central nervous system. The nerves that go through the whole body make up the peripheral nervous system.</strong><p></p><p>5. How do these nerve cells make connections within the brain and relay messages? </p><p></p><strong>answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>When neurons communicate, the neurotransmitters from one neuron are released, cross the synapse, and attach themselves to special molecules in the next neuron called receptors. Receptors receive and process the message, then send it on to the next neuron. 4. Eventually, the message reaches the brain.</strong><p></p><p>6. How do you think your body react when it feels pain?</p><p></p><strong>answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>When we feel pain, such as when we touch a hot stove, sensory receptors in our skin send a message via nerve fibres (A-delta fibres and C fibres) to the spinal cord and brainstem and then onto the brain where the sensation of pain is registered, the information is processed and the pain is </strong><strong>perceived</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Wat u gonna do wida pikpakpak #Rastamanyow#RastamanForPresident</p><br />
