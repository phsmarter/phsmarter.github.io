                                            Until the 1960s, people in the United States did not particularly pay attention to the natural environment. Rather, Americans were more focused on the economy. However, with an increase in oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, and the loss of wilderness, suddenly  people  realizes they shared  common values.  They called for a national  organization  to protect  the environment. Accordingly, on April 22, 1970, the first Earth DAY, 20 MILLION Americans  took to the streets, parks  and auditoriums  to demonstrate  for a healthy, sustainable  environment. Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration   of the environment.
The first Earth Day led to the creation of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA)  and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered   Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress  worked together  to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment. The EPA  was  assigned  the daunting  task  of repairing  the damage already done  to the natural environment.

b. to propose the need for further actions by the government

                            14. Until the 1960s, people in the United States did not particularly pay attention to the natural environment. Rather, Americans were more focused on the economy. However, with an increase in oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, and the loss of wilderness, suddenly  people  realizes they shared  common values.  They called for a national  organization  to protect  the environment. Accordingly, on April 22, 1970, the first Earth DAY, 20 MILLION Americans  took to the streets, parks  and auditoriums  to demonstrate  for a healthy, sustainable  environment. Thousands  of colleges  and universities  organized protests against  the  deterioration   of the environment.
The first Earth Day led to the creation of the United States  Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA)  and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered   Species Acts. President Richard Nixon and Congress  worked together  to established the EPA in response  to the growing public demand  for cleaner water, air and land. Prior to the establishment of the EPA, the  national government was not structured to make  coordinated attack on the pollutants, which harm  human  health  and degrade  the environment. The EPA  was  assigned  the daunting  task  of repairing  the damage already done  to the natural environment.

1. What do you think your country's foreign policy goals should be? Do you want to gain power and influence overseas or simply protect your sovereignty? Explain why you think these goals are appropriate, using historical examples.
2. Should the country align itself with NATO, the Warsaw Pact, or the Unaligned Movement? Explain your answer, using historical examples.
3. However the country chooses to align itself, what type of foreign policy should it have toward the rest of the world? Should it be more aggressive or more diplomatic? Explain your answer, using historical examples.
pls answer asap</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>As a country, Karmin's foreign policy goals should primarily focus on protecting its sovereignty and security while also promoting economic growth and stability. This can be achieved through a combination of diplomatic and military means, as well as through economic and trade agreements. Historically, countries that have prioritized their own security and economic prosperity have been able to maintain stability and prosperity for their citizens.In terms of alliances, Karmin should align itself with the Unaligned Movement. This will allow the country to maintain its independence and autonomy in decision-making while also allowing it to form partnerships and alliances on a case-by-case basis. Historically, non-aligned countries have been able to navigate the complexities of international relations more effectively as they are not bound by the constraints of a specific alliance.In terms of foreign policy towards the rest of the world, Karmin should adopt a balanced approach that combines elements of both diplomacy and assertiveness. This approach will enable the country to engage with other nations on a wide range of issues, from trade and economic cooperation to security and defense. However, it is important for the country to be prepared to defend its interests when necessary. This type of foreign policy has been shown to be effective in the past, as demonstrated by countries that have been able to maintain good relations with other nations while also effectively defending their own interests.<p></p><br />
