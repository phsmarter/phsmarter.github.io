                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dear Mother Earth,</p><p> </p><p>Here’s to you, the first mother I knew. You’re where I was born, where I continue to grow, where I eat, and play, and love. I call you by a human name, but I know your nature is greater and more ancient than humankind. We are just one of the youngest of your many children—and maybe the most rebellious.</p><p> </p><p>I’m an ever-curious mind seeking out meaning within things that can’t be explained by our little brains. I’ve settled on the notion that you create magic beyond the realms of science or philosophy.</p><p> </p><p>As I’ve grown, I’ve found myself fortunate enough to enjoy your presence time and time again. Whiling away hours amongst your trees, along your rivers, and atop your peaks. I take solace in your warmth; you always welcome me with open arms to places some others of my kind do not. Through no fault of your own, your open fields have been fenced off and stamped with a false sense of ownership. For those lucky enough to take their first breaths and first steps far from the gray of towns and cities, your green pastures are home.</p><p> </p><p>And for them, as for everyone, home is safety.</p><p> </p><p>That sense of safety shifts with my presence. My skin too dark, my hair too unstraight. The lies they’ve been told over centuries seeping into their unconscious, making them fear our outward differences. A fear that intensifies toward those with skin tones even darker than mine. Eyes that can’t help but glance or stare from a place of discomfort. But still I continue loving you, not allowing their discomfort to keep me from you.</p><p> </p><p>You are a source of hope. The kind of hope that’s necessary right now given what we’ve done to you. We’ve created systems to exploit. We’ve even given a name to your generous offerings: resources. We all get lost in ourselves sometimes—forgetting we’re forever connected to you. When we breathe your air, drink your water, use your herbs to heal us when we’re sick, we silently thank you.</p><p> </p><p>My presence is the best gift I can give to you now—an awareness of you in every moment. And a promise to fight for you in every way I can.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>good luck </p><br />

                            5. 1.The cause of the "ancient grudge" between the Montagues and the Capulets is never explained in the play,what do you think might have been the cause for them to become great enemies?2.If you are given a chance, what advice would you give to Romeo and Juliet about love?3.Was the love of Romeo and Juliet to each other too rash, unadvised and sudden? Can love at first sight be true love?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Shakespeare never explains why the Capulets and Montagues hate each other and are constantly fighting. ... The reader also knows that both the Capulets and Montagues are wealthy and influential families in Verona. Those facts lead me to suspect that the feud originated over some kind of economic dealings that went badly.
</p><p>2.Juliet tells Romeo that if his intentions are true, then they should set up a time to get married. She says, If that thy bent of love be honourable, ... So they plan (within hours of knowing each other) to get married.
</p><p>3.Romeo only first caught sight of Juliet about an hour or two before they decided to get married; they had only spoken for at most ten minutes. Was their love as Juliet said, "too rash, too unadvised, to sudden"? ... They did not truly love each other, they were only acting upon their emotions as many teenagers do.
