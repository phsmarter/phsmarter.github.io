                            1. Reflective essay about social work​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>         ●Working with others and improving own learning and performance are highly essential skills in social work. In this essay I will reflect on how well I have developed these two skills and what I need to do to improve them. </p><p></p><p>Before starting the degree course in university, I already had the skill working with others. As I have worked with others who were on the same course as me in the sixth form and also I did voluntary work placement which required people working together.</p><p></p><p>Before starting the university my working with others was sometimes effective and sometimes not very effective depending on the people I worked with, on the topic or area we had to work on. In sixth form I got on well with everybody in my class and working with them was not difficult. For example once me and two other students had to make a PowerPoint presentation on smoking. We worked together in planning what information will be included in the PowerPoint and who will write about what, what other materials we will need such as leaflets and who will get them. So before creating the PowerPoint presentation we planned everything together. Once the PowerPoint was created we then decided the number of slides each of us will read and talk about. So here I worked with others effectively and our PowerPoint presentation was successful.</p><p></p><p>However there have been times where I did not work effectively with others especially on my voluntary work placement. I did voluntary work in a nursery. I enjoyed working with the children there but I did not get on very well with the staff. The staff there did not interact with me as much and most of them usually gave orders to me e.g. to get something. When it came to working with the staff e.g. when getting the snack ready for the middle of paper alance my time. For example working for two hours and then spend one hour with friends.  This would enable me to get my work done or meet my targets and fullfil other demands.</p><p>In conclusion I believe that I have developed both skills working with others and improving your own learning and performance. But I need to work on these skills so I can use them in a more effective way; and I also recognise that I will not develop these in a short period of time. I will have to work on the strategies I have mentioned throughout the assignment in order to improve these skills.</p><p>It may take a long time to make progress in these skills but what I need to remember and implement is the strategies that I have mentioned. Also in this process I will be able to find out whether these strategies work on me or not and if there are other strategies that can help in improving my skills.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sorry masyadong mahaba cut nyo lang kung san kayo comfortable and please mark me if it's helpful  :)</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Core Social Work Values: 5 of the Most Important</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>Integrity, individual dignity, compassionate care, social justice, and human connections are among the more than five key social work ideals. The efficacy of social work activities and programs is dependent on these key beliefs. These core codes have a specific function. They lay the moral groundwork for the social worker's organization, for example, and they outline the ethical ideas that are utilized to create professional standards and govern social work activities. These codes assist <strong>social workers</strong> in identifying professional responsibilities as well as legal conflicts of interest. The guidelines serve as public standards against which <strong>social workers</strong> can be held responsible.</p><p>1. Service</p><p>The fundamental purpose of social workers is to provide excellent public service by assisting needy individuals in addressing, managing, and resolving a variety of social issues. <strong>Social workers</strong> must always prioritize public service before personal gain and self-interest.<strong> Social workers</strong> utilize their skills and experience to assist clients in overcoming major social issues such as drug addiction, child abuse, homelessness, and criminal conduct.</p><p>2. Equality in the workplace</p><p><strong>Social workers</strong> seek to promote social fairness and combat injustice. They provide vulnerable persons and oppressed groups with social assistance and resources. They raise public awareness of social justice concerns and encourage people to value cultural variety and genetic variation. They advocate for fair opportunities and a healthy client relationship.</p><p>3. Values</p><p>Each person's dignity and worth is respected by <strong>social workers</strong>. Each client is treated with care and respect, taking into account individual characteristics, cultural norms, and ethnic diversity. They encourage clients to make socially responsible decisions based on their personal principles. Social workers work to help their clients change, meet their own needs, and become more self-sufficient.</p><p>4. Relationships between people</p><p>Human interactions are of paramount significance to social workers. They recognize that interpersonal interactions are critical vehicles for change, advocacy, and equity. Clients, other professionals, and community program personnel are all included as partners in the healing and assisting process by <strong>social workers</strong>. They work to repair and enhance the functionality of clients, their families, and communities through improving interpersonal interactions.</p><p>5. Integrity</p><p>Social professionals must always behave with integrity. They must be mindful of their organization's goal, their profession's principles, and their own personal ethical standards at all times. To inspire their coworkers and promote their company,<strong> social workers </strong>must conduct themselves in public in an honest and responsible manner.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. define social work;

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. Work Immersion: Social Graces in the Workplace</p><p></p><p>During my work immersion, I learned a lot about the importance of social graces in the workplace. It is not just about having the technical skills to do your job, but also about having the right attitude and behavior towards your colleagues and superiors.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that I observed is the way people greet each other. It may seem like a small thing, but it sets the tone for the entire day. Saying good morning or good afternoon with a smile and a nod is a simple yet effective way to show respect and acknowledge someone's presence.</p><p></p><p>Another aspect of social graces is communication. It is important to listen attentively and speak politely to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts. One of my colleagues taught me the importance of using "please" and "thank you" in every conversation, no matter how small or trivial it may seem.</p><p></p><p>I also learned about the value of punctuality. Being on time shows that you respect other people's time and that you are committed to your work. It also helps to create a positive impression, especially when meeting clients or attending meetings.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my work immersion experience taught me that social graces are essential in creating a harmonious and productive workplace. It is not just about the technical skills, but also about the way you treat others and conduct yourself in a professional setting.</p><p></p><p>B. Work Immersion: Things to do in the Workplace</p><p></p><p>During my work immersion, I discovered that there are many things to do in the workplace aside from the actual work itself. These activities not only help to break the monotony of work, but also help to build camaraderie among colleagues.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that we did was to organize team building activities. We had an outdoor activity where we did a series of challenges that required teamwork and communication. It was a fun way to bond with my colleagues and learn to work together towards a common goal.</p><p></p><p>Another activity that we did was to organize a sportsfest. We had different sports events such as basketball, volleyball, and badminton. It was a great way to promote physical fitness and healthy competition among colleagues.</p><p></p><p>We also had a charity event where we volunteered our time and resources to help the less fortunate. We visited a local orphanage and spent time with the children. It was a humbling experience that reminded us of the importance of giving back to the community.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my work immersion experience taught me that there are many things to do in the workplace aside from work. These activities not only help to break the monotony of work, but also help to build strong relationships and promote a positive workplace culture.</p><p></p><p>C. Career Guidance: Make Your Passion Your Profession</p><p></p><p>Choosing a career can be a daunting task, especially if you are unsure of what you want to do. However, one of the best ways to make a decision is to follow your passion.</p><p></p><p>During my career guidance session, I realized that my passion lies in photography. I have always been fascinated by the art of capturing moments and telling stories through images. So, I decided to pursue a career in photography.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to gain the necessary skills and knowledge. I enrolled in a photography course and learned the technical aspects of photography such as lighting, composition, and editing. I also attended workshops and seminars to learn from experienced photographers.</p><p></p><p>The next step was to gain experience. I started by doing freelance photography jobs such as weddings and events. This helped me to hone my skills and build my portfolio. I also joined a photography club where I met like-minded individuals and learned from their experiences.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, I was able to turn my passion into a profession. I started my own photography business and now, I am able to do what I love every day.</p><p></p><p>My career guidance experience taught me that following your passion can lead to</p><p></p><br />

Therefore, communication in learning must be effective so that it can improve achievement and teaching and learning outcomes. Likewise in the workplace, good communication is important in the workplace because little work is an act in itself. It takes communication to work in a team, and even people working alone must report to their superiors. If you run a business, you must tell your employees what is expected of them. Poor communication leads to errors, failures, and sometimes lawsuits. Effective communication helps prevent these mistakes.</p><p></p><p><strong>No less important is communication in special relationships. </strong>One of the main keys in maintaining the rhythm of a good and healthy relationship is communication.

In a wider and crucial scope, namely in social interaction. We can find examples of social interaction in everyday life.</p><p></p><p>Social interaction is something that we cannot avoid every day. <strong>Humans are social creatures who interact with other individuals every day.</strong> This social interaction can occur between individuals or groups. The purpose of this reciprocal relationship is to establish friendships, discussions, and collaborations that are applied in social life. One of the characteristics of social interaction is the number of interaction actors more than one or more people. Social interaction occurs when there is communication between social actors using symbols. There are three types of social interactions that exist in our daily lives, namely individual social interaction with individuals, individual social interactions with groups, and group social interactions with groups.</p><p></p><p><strong>Social communication between individuals and individuals</strong>, namely greeting each other and asking how they are passing by neighbors, inviting them to play with their brothers or sisters at home. Another example is a student asking the teacher about the subject matter that has not been understood, father and mother talking together after a long day at work, buyers and traders haggling in the market. Second, the <strong>social communication of individuals with groups</strong>. For example, a resource person gives an explanation at a seminar, a salesperson conducts a cooking demonstration at the social gathering for the neighborhood women, the principal is talking to the students during the ceremony, a teacher is teaching his students in class.

It was a period of learning and growth, both personally and professionally. The experience taught me the importance of social graces in the workplace.</p><p></p><p>I was placed with a prestigious law firm, and I was immediately thrown into a professional environment. Everyone had a certain level of etiquette that was expected and that I was expected to abide by—from the way we greeted each other in the morning, to the way we took coffee orders. I didn’t quite understand the importance of those social graces at first, but as the weeks passed, I noticed that it had an effect on how people interacted. I started to pick up on cues easily, such as the right time to introduce myself to someone, or when it was okay to ask a question. It helped me become a better listener and understand the expectations of the firm.</p><p></p><p>I continued to hone my social graces at work and began to understand the business world more. For example, I learned to be diplomatic and tactful when having conversations, especially with clients and colleagues. I also learned how to handle stress in a constructive manner, rather than getting worked up over small matters. </p><p></p><p><strong>B</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>W</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>k</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>It was my first day of social grace work immersion and I was feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. I had been looking forward to this opportunity for months and now the moment had finally arrived! I knew that if I wanted to make the most of this experience I had to go into it with an open mind and be prepared to take on any task that I was given.</p><p></p><p>The first activity of the day was a workshop about workplace etiquette. We were taught how to greet colleagues and superiors, dress appropriately and use appropriate language. We also discussed the importance of maintaining a professional attitude and how to handle challenging situations in the workplace.</p><p></p><p>Once the workshop was over, it was time to go out onto the floor and observe how things were done. I watched various departments and employees interact, noting the different approaches they took when dealing with customers. I saw how managers dealt with complaints and how staff handled difficult tasks. It was clear to me that everyone was doing their best to make sure the workplace ran smoothly.</p><p></p><p><strong>C</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> </strong><strong>G</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>:</strong> The idea of being able to make your passion your profession can be both exciting and daunting. It takes courage and tenacity to pursue a career that you are truly passionate about, but the rewards can be immense. With the right guidance and advice, anyone can find ways to turn their passion into a successful, rewarding career.</p><p></p><p>As a starting point for anyone considering turning their passion into a profession, it is important to remember that success does not come overnight. Having a clear plan with achievable goals will help you stay focused and organized. Take the time to research the industry, evolving trends, and any potential obstacles you may face. Knowing the pitfalls and potential rewards associated with a specific career path will go a long way in helping you achieve success.</p><p></p><p>In addition to researching the industry, networking is an invaluable tool when building a career in any field. Reach out to industry professionals, whether it be through industry events or online groups. Make sure to have an elevator pitch prepared that clearly states your goals, values, and interests. It never hurts to get a few recommendations from colleagues or mentors to set yourself apart. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong><strong>)</strong> <strong>During my work immersion experience, I learned the importance of social graces in the workplace. It is crucial to maintain a professional demeanor at all times, whether it be through proper communication, punctuality, or dress code. I observed that a respectful attitude towards colleagues and superiors can go a long way in building positive relationships and creating a harmonious work environment. Additionally, being able to adapt to different work styles and personalities is a valuable skill that can enhance productivity and teamwork. Overall, my work immersion experience has taught me that social graces are not just niceties, but essential components of a successful career.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>B.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>During my work immersion, I learned that there are several things that one can do in the workplace to make the most out of the experience. First and foremost, it is important to always be punctual and arrive on time for work. This shows respect for your employer and colleagues and sets a good example for others. Additionally, it is important to be proactive and take initiative in your work. This means asking questions, seeking feedback, and taking on additional responsibilities when possible. Finally, it is important to maintain a positive attitude and work well with others. By being a team player and fostering positive relationships with colleagues, you can create a more enjoyable and productive work environment.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>C.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>As we grow up, we are often asked what we want to be when we grow up. For some, the answer comes easily, while for others, it takes time to figure out. I was one of those who took time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.

It was not an easy journey, but with guidance and hard work, I was able to turn my passion into a successful career.
