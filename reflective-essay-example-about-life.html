Does it come from my religious parents, tradition, and culture?
What are my proofs that God exists?
If god exists, can he do all things, know all things and is he all good?..
If god exists, why does he allow evil?
What is evil? What are the examples of evilness?
Is evil necessary? If so, what is the purpose of evil?
Is god able to eliminate evil?
Is he willing to eliminate evil?
If god loves me, why does he allow me to experience pain and suffering? 
How can i trust god if he allows me to experience the difficulties in life?
How can i believe in god despite my unanswered prayers?
Where can i find meaning, how do i find meaning from all the sufferings and pain i experience?
How about the other people, if we claim that god is merciful, kind, just, loving, and helpful, why does he allow other people to be killed, raped, abused, tortured, meet accident, be a victim of calamity? Do they deserve such fate, if not, why is it that god is not there in times of need?
Where and how can i find meaning in all of these?..
