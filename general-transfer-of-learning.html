                                            Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge,
habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching,
research and training. It can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal
education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum. 
In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role
in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most
effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and
improving people's health is by investing in education.

                                            ACTIVITY 1HEAT VS TEMPERATUREBackground Information:Many years ago, people believed that heat was an invisible substance called caloric. A bodyexposed to a flame would get much of this caloric which could readily be transferred to a coldbody. This caloric theory, however, could not explain how heat is produced by friction.Heat may be thought of as internal energy in transmit. When heat is added to a body, itstemperature generally increases. When heat is removed, its temperature generally decreases.The temperature change that goes with addition and removal of a given amount of heat varieswith the mass and nature of the body.Learning CompetencyDifferentiate between heat and temperature at the molecular level.(S8FElg-29)Pre-learning Check1.

                            10. ACTIVITY 1HEAT VS TEMPERATUREBackground Information:Many years ago, people believed that heat was an invisible substance called caloric. A bodyexposed to a flame would get much of this caloric which could readily be transferred to a coldbody. This caloric theory, however, could not explain how heat is produced by friction.Heat may be thought of as internal energy in transmit. When heat is added to a body, itstemperature generally increases. When heat is removed, its temperature generally decreases.The temperature change that goes with addition and removal of a given amount of heat varieswith the mass and nature of the body.Learning CompetencyDifferentiate between heat and temperature at the molecular level.(S8FElg-29)Pre-learning Check1.

PHASE CHANGES require either the addition of heat energy (melting, evaporation, and sublimation) or subtraction of heat energy (condensation and freezing). ...
