                            1. ANSWER THE TEST OF ACTION. 
A test of action: (what should I do?) The tests of action are multiple and are meant to help with ethical decision-making, using the power of imagination. 
1. The publicity test: how would I feel if my contemplated actions were reported in the paper or broadcast on 
2.The mentor test: how would I feel if my actions were seen by my most revered mentor (teacher/professor, father, mother, etc.) 
3. The role model test: what would my greatest role model do here? 
4.The mirror test: if I do this, can I look at myself in the mirror and feel a sense of pride and dignity?</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong>The tests of action you have listed can be helpful in ethical decision-making by encouraging you to consider how your actions may be perceived by others and how they align with your own values and principles. Here are some suggestions for what you can do when using each of these tests:<p></p><strong>The publicity test:</strong> Imagine that your actions will be reported in the newspaper or broadcast on television. Consider how you would feel if others knew about what you were planning to do. If you would be ashamed or embarrassed, it may be a sign that your actions are not ethical. If you would feel proud and confident, it may be a sign that your actions are ethical.<strong>The mentor test:</strong> Imagine that your actions will be seen by someone you respect and admire, such as a mentor, teacher, or parent. Consider how you would feel if they were to witness what you were planning to do. If you would be disappointed or ashamed, it may be a sign that your actions are not ethical. If you would feel proud and confident, it may be a sign that your actions are ethical.<strong>The role model test:</strong> Consider what your greatest role model would do in this situation. Think about their values and principles and how they would approach the situation. If your actions align with what your role model would do, it may be a sign that your actions are ethical. If your actions conflict with what your role model would do, it may be a sign that your actions are not ethical.<strong>The mirror test:</strong> Look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if you can feel a sense of pride and dignity in the actions you are planning to take. If you feel proud and confident, it may be a sign that your actions are ethical. If you feel ashamed or embarrassed, it may be a sign that your actions are not ethical.<p></p><p><strong>Remember that these tests are just tools to help you make ethical decisions, and they are not foolproof. Ultimately, you need to use your own judgment and consider the unique circumstances of each situation when making ethical decisions.</strong></p><br />
