Here's my attempt by the way:</p><p></p><strong>This is my rewriting of a story titled High and Lifted Up by Mike Krath</strong><p></p><p>The story took place on a certain windy day. “Be careful, it is so windy today,” said Tommy’s mother. Outside, Tommy saw yellow, gold, and red leaves leaping blew out by the wind. “If I was a leaf, I would fly clear across the world,” Tommy thought. Then, Tommy’s mother went outside too, looking for him. </p><p>But, Tommy had become a leaf. He was blowing down the street with other leaves. Suddenly, a maple leaf approached him, and they both flew up into the air “If you blew in that direction, you will end up in the city dump. While the other direction will take you high into the air and see things that no leaf has seen before.” Continued the older leaf. The maple leaf wants to go to the city dump. </p><p>So Tommy followed him. The older leaf was blown and lifted high into the air. He said to them that the sights are spectacular up there. But Tommy and the maple leaf ignored him. The older leaf shouted to them again, that he said a fire in the city dump. But the maple leaf said that he didn’t see a thing. </p><p>When Tommy is about to arrive at the city dump, his mother appeared and then forbids him to go to the city dump. For she saw smokes there. Tommy saw his friend, the maple leaf struggled to get out of the city dump. Then, his mother took the maple leaf and put it into her pocket.</p><p></p><p>Source of the story: http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/HighLift.shtml</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>other questions about rewriting </strong>by visiting https://brainly.ph/question/25668166</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
