Nathaniel Hawthorne opens his novel, The Scarlet Letter, with a paragraphthat depicts a crowd assembled in front of a prison door. The people are waiting forHester Prynne to show up with her scarlet letter "A." The author describes the crowdas a "throng. suggesting a mob-like and densely packed group. The mood is notpleasant, but somber - displayed by their "sad-colored" garments, hoods, and gray8.hats. Another interesting description about the men's hats is that they were steeple-crowned, which suggests that the people of the town are associated with thechurch that had punished Hester. The author's description of women as "intermixed"with men, alludes to the people in town lacking individuality. The use of passivevoice was assembled" further implies lack of individuality._2. Speedometer is a device used for measuring the speed of a vehicle.3. In the final stanza of his poem The Road Not Taken, Frost talks abouthis dilemma of coming upon two diverging paths, and not knowing which one tochoose. The third line is very important, as it delivers an idea of choosing between thetwo divergent paths.The tone in this stanza shifts from regretful to optimistic. The tive roads symbolicallyrepresent individual choices. The mood is neither depressed nor unhappy, but thepoet sighs because he knows what the complexities our life may have for him. Whetherhe has chosen a right or a wrong path, it has a compelling impact on his life.The phrase "less traveled suggests the theme of individualism.4. "Could you repeat the concept about mammals?5.

                                            "The Road Not Taken" By Robert Frost Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim Because it was grassy and wanted wear, Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, marked the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by And that has made all the difference.

                                            1. “Chicago”
In "Chicago," Carl Sandburg describes the city as a "bold slugger," "a savage," a "young man," and "an ignorant fighter." What do all these descriptions have in common? How do they relate to Chicago as a rapidly growing city at the start of the twentieth century? 
2. “Grass”
As Carl Sandburg's "Grass" ends, the grass again calls to be allowed to work. As readers see in the poem, the work of the grass is to cover the evidence of the tragic events that happen on battlefields so that people no longer recognize these places as battlefields. Is the work of the grass positive or negative? Why? What does it mean that the poem ends with the grass repeating its demand to be allowed to work?
3. “The Road Not Taken”
Consider the ambiguity of the poem's final line. The speaker imagines himself in the future stating that his decision to take the road less traveled has made all the difference. Is this necessarily a positive statement or an endorsement of his choice? How might the speaker's statement be interpreted as less than positive? 
4. “After Apple Picking”
At the conclusion of "After Apple-Picking," the speaker is thinking about his upcoming sleep and wondering if it will be like the hibernation of the woodchuck or "just some human sleep." What is one possible symbolic interpretation of the speaker's sleep? How does interpreting the speaker's sleep as a symbol change the meaning of the rest of the poem?</a>

Nathaniel Hawthorne opens his novel, The Scarlet Letter, with a paragraphthat depicts a crowd assembled in front of a prison door. The people are waiting forHester Prynne to show up with her scarlet letter "A." The author describes the crowdas a "throng. suggesting a mob-like and densely packed group. The mood is notpleasant, but somber - displayed by their "sad-colored" garments, hoods, and gray8.hats. Another interesting description about the men's hats is that they were steeple-crowned, which suggests that the people of the town are associated with thechurch that had punished Hester. The author's description of women as "intermixed"with men, alludes to the people in town lacking individuality. The use of passivevoice was assembled" further implies lack of individuality._2. Speedometer is a device used for measuring the speed of a vehicle.3. In the final stanza of his poem The Road Not Taken, Frost talks abouthis dilemma of coming upon two diverging paths, and not knowing which one tochoose. The third line is very important, as it delivers an idea of choosing between thetwo divergent paths.The tone in this stanza shifts from regretful to optimistic. The tive roads symbolicallyrepresent individual choices. The mood is neither depressed nor unhappy, but thepoet sighs because he knows what the complexities our life may have for him. Whetherhe has chosen a right or a wrong path, it has a compelling impact on his life.The phrase "less traveled suggests the theme of individualism.4. "Could you repeat the concept about mammals?5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.<strong>Because the poem isn't “The Road Less Traveled.” It's “The Road Not Taken.” And the road not taken, of course, is the road one didn't take—which means that the title passes over the “less traveled” road the speaker claims to have followed in order to foreground the road he never tried.</strong></p><p></p><p>2.<strong>The two roads symbolize the choices that one has to make in life.

"The Road Not Taken" By Robert Frost Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim Because it was grassy and wanted wear, Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, marked the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by And that has made all the difference.

                            18. 1. “Chicago”
In "Chicago," Carl Sandburg describes the city as a "bold slugger," "a savage," a "young man," and "an ignorant fighter." What do all these descriptions have in common? How do they relate to Chicago as a rapidly growing city at the start of the twentieth century? 
2. “Grass”
As Carl Sandburg's "Grass" ends, the grass again calls to be allowed to work. As readers see in the poem, the work of the grass is to cover the evidence of the tragic events that happen on battlefields so that people no longer recognize these places as battlefields. Is the work of the grass positive or negative? Why? What does it mean that the poem ends with the grass repeating its demand to be allowed to work?
3. “The Road Not Taken”
Consider the ambiguity of the poem's final line. The speaker imagines himself in the future stating that his decision to take the road less traveled has made all the difference. Is this necessarily a positive statement or an endorsement of his choice? How might the speaker's statement be interpreted as less than positive? 
4. “After Apple Picking”
At the conclusion of "After Apple-Picking," the speaker is thinking about his upcoming sleep and wondering if it will be like the hibernation of the woodchuck or "just some human sleep." What is one possible symbolic interpretation of the speaker's sleep? How does interpreting the speaker's sleep as a symbol change the meaning of the rest of the poem?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Story Analysis</strong></p><p><strong>1. Chicago</strong></p><p>Bold slugger, a savage, a young man, and an ignorant fighter are descriptions of people living in one country particularly in Chicago. Some people of Chicago are like bold slugger since they can be as tough as their punches. They are those who are well adjusted and can be very tough. The second group are like savages who are like monsters. They are the ones who uses their masculinity just to undermine others. There are also groups of people that are like young men who seem too innocent. And the last group are like  ignorant fighters who do not know how to fight and where to begin. Chicago was once like these groups of people during the twentieth century. The city was filled with different groups of people just like them who have different ways of approaching life challenges.</p><p><strong>2. Grass</strong></p><p>The work of the grass can be both positive and negative. Covering the evidence of tragic events that happen on battlefields so that people will no longer recognize these places as battlefields can be a positive work since the grass do not want people to dwell on the negative things that have happened. They want people to recover at once and be not affected with the tragedy that have happened. On the contrary, the work of the grass can also be negative since it does not allow people to at least mourn for their deads and they do not want them to have a recollection of their past. The poem ends with the grass repeating its demand to be allowed to work only means that the grass work begins when lives end and it will be repeatedly done over and over again.</p><p><strong>3. Road Not Taken</strong></p><p>The last two lines of the poem are simply an endorsement of the author's choice. However, it can also be interpreted as less than positive since it can be sensed as a form of regret for not choosing the road that he thinks is best for him.</p><p><strong>4. After Apple Picking</strong></p><p>The speaker's sleep might be interpreted as a moment of silence and thinking. It is just like having a break after a very tiring work or a long day. Interpreting it this way will make the poem to be more meaningful since it implies that whatever are nature of work are we need to have some sort of rest in order to rearrange things and see if there are still works to be done or accomplished. </p><br />
