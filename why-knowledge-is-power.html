That is why Jesus, in the Gospel, said to Thomas, "Happy are those who believe even without seeing
evidence. Continuing to believe makes a person convinced and certain of his or her faith and that's what
makes a Christian fortunate and happy. We believe not so much because there are convincing evidences
presented to us but because we trust God, the Giver of faith, whom we know does not and cannot be
deceived.
Similarly, it does not mean that faith is "blind acceptance. So then, faith involves believing, doing, and
prayerful trusting. It is not just knowing God but it is expressing that knowledge in our actions, and that same
knowledge will serve as our "security blanket" in whatever we do and whatever we go through. Faith that is
lived and celebrated in worship is a force within us that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gradually works a
transformation in our daily thoughts, hopes, attitudes, and values.

                                            Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment: 15 minutes      Challenges are meant to motivate you and see what you are capable of doing. What's more, when you try to look back on those tough times, you can be truly proud of how you have overcome them using the most powerful weapon that you have your gained knowledge and skills. Your experiences at home, school and community, both positive and negative, give you important lessons that can help and guide you in dealing with future challenges.       The following are ways on how you can use and apply your academic and life lessons to deal future challenges:       3 Rs of Overcoming Life's Challenges through Gained Knowledge 1. Reflect. Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through your thoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences at home, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solving and decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advice that your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration not only on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions and reflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help you succeed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearn and re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experience to another.3. Review. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details of what you have learned. Learning is built on prior knowledge that's why in school, review is a very important part of the teaching and learning process. When done well, this gives you the opportunity to take what you have learned, make it your own, and apply it. More so, in your daily life, you can simply review and apply the knowledge and lessons that you have learned to any academic or personal challenges.​</a>

                                            explain why? Citation and proper referencing are very important in writing academic papers, especially that this generation is at the height of advance technology use, which makes it easier for people to navigate and access information online. As students, you are accountable for your actions; thus, before you can call yourselves "professionals", you have to practice proper and responsible referencing and learn the rules by heart. In this country where, instead of committing to responsible writing, celebrating fake news has been rampant, the so-called millennials and generation Z therefore have the social obligation to do away with the wrong practice and spread the knowledge about maximizing the power of technology to fight against plagiarism.​</a>

believe is an affirmation that we have faith. But what is faith? It is a personal decision and involves the voluele
prayer and worship person. It includes the head or knowledge of God, the hands or our actions, and the heart expressed in our
That is why Jesus, in the Gospel, said to Thomas, "Happy are those who believe even without seeing
evidence. Continuing to believe makes a person convinced and certain of his or her faith and that's what
makes a Christian fortunate and happy. We believe not so much because there are convincing evidences
presented to us but because we trust God, the Giver of faith, whom we know does not and cannot be
deceived.
Similarly, it does not mean that faith is "blind acceptance. So then, faith involves believing, doing, and
prayerful trusting. It is not just knowing God but it is expressing that knowledge in our actions, and that same
knowledge will serve as our "security blanket" in whatever we do and whatever we go through. Faith that is
lived and celebrated in worship is a force within us that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gradually works a
transformation in our daily thoughts, hopes, attitudes, and values.

What are the manifestations of this statement in our society?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Social Science as a discipline provides various frameworks, concepts, and tools that can be utilized to address present-day problems in the community. By understanding the human behavior and social processes that shape our society, we can analyze the causes and consequences of current issues and develop solutions that are effective and sustainable. In summary, Social Science provides a valuable lens through which we can understand and address present-day problems in our community. By utilizing its frameworks, concepts, and tools, we can develop strategies that are evidence-based, effective, and sustainable.E.B. Tylor's definition of culture as a "complex whole" means that culture is composed of various interconnected components such as beliefs, values, practices, and material artifacts that form a coherent system. Applying this definition to Philippine society, we can understand the diverse and complex nature of Philippine culture. In the Philippines, culture is shaped by a variety of factors such as history, religion, language, and geography. The country's rich history of colonization, trade, and migration has resulted in a diverse mix of cultures and influences, which have been integrated into the fabric of Filipino society. In summary, Tylor's definition of culture as a "complex whole" is useful in understanding Philippine society as a diverse and interconnected system shaped by a variety of historical, cultural, and social factors.Firstly, understanding political science concepts such as governance, democracy, and civil society can equip individuals with the knowledge to participate in civic activities, such as voting, advocacy, and community organizing. By participating in these activities, individuals can practice their civic skills, such as critical thinking, public speaking, and leadership, while promoting humane ideals such as social justice, equality, and human rights. Secondly, studying political science can also help individuals develop a critical understanding of the political system and its impact on society. This can lead to a greater awareness of social and political issues, and a deeper empathy for the experiences of marginalized groups. With this knowledge, individuals can use their voice to advocate for the rights and well-being of these groups, and work towards creating a more just and equitable society. Finally, political science can also provide individuals with a global perspective on political issues and events. By studying politics in other countries, individuals can gain an appreciation for diverse cultures and ways of life, and develop a sense of global citizenship. This can lead to a greater understanding of the interconnectedness of political issues, and a deeper commitment to promoting peace and cooperation among nations.In recent years, there has been a rise in the popularity of Filipino music and dance, with Filipino artists gaining international recognition. Additionally, traditional Filipino dance, such as the Tinikling and the Singkil, has gained recognition and popularity in international dance competitions. Filipino cuisine has also gained popularity worldwide, with Filipino dishes like adobo, sinigang, and halo-halo becoming more widely known and appreciated. In terms of fashion and beauty, there has been a growing interest in Filipino textiles and fashion, with designers incorporating traditional Filipino fabrics and styles into their designs.Politics is often said to be about power sharing and power struggle because it involves the distribution and exercise of power among individuals and groups within a society. Those who hold power may seek to maintain it, while those who do not may seek to gain it. This struggle for power can manifest in various ways in our society. Another manifestation of power struggle in politics is the tension between different branches of government. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government may have different interests and priorities, which can result in conflicts and power struggles as each branch tries to assert its influence and control over government functions. Furthermore, power struggles can also occur within and between social groups in society. For example, there may be conflicts between labor unions and business owners over worker rights and wages. There may also be struggles between different ethnic or religious groups over political representation or access to resources.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>douitashimashite</p><br />
