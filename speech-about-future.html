                            1. Speech about career as a future teacher?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>to respected principals,teachers and to my fellow students,good day ! Teachers hold a very special place in the lives of students. They play a very important role in shaping a nation’s future by guiding their students in becoming ideal citizens. it’s an opportunity for me to share few words about teachers, their role in schools and colleges and their influence on the students.</p><p>Teachers are the backbone of our society because they majorly contribute in shaping the future of a nation, i.e. students and guide them in becoming an ideal citizen of the country. Teacher’s job is full of responsibility and challenges because not every student is same and thus the teacher has to be dynamic and adopt different teaching patterns for different students. Teaching is a social practice and more than knowledge, a teacher must be a good human being who can very well shoulder the responsibility of his/her job and understand the sensitivity of the situation where students from different backgrounds have come together for learning and thus apply skills and knowledge to the best of his/her capacity while teaching.
</p><p>Some of the qualities which every teacher must possess in order to become most acceptable are:
</p><p>Enthusiasm – It is a known fact that teachers who show enthusiasm while teaching create a positive atmosphere and learning environment which help students in gaining knowledge fast and with fun. These teachers don’t follow the uniform pattern instead, they innovate teaching methods to keep the students engaged and enthusiastic.
</p><p>The most important role a teacher plays is in motivating the students; some of the students find their teacher to be a role model and try to imitate them. Thus it is very important that the teacher leaves a positive impression on each student.
</p><p>Interaction with learners – It is very important for the teacher to indulge into transparent and open discussion with the students in order to understand the capability of the learner. Some students are shy, while other may be afraid of failure. A teacher is highly trusted to build up the student emotionally and practically.
</p><p>Conventionally, teaching is considered equivalent to praying. In olden days, parents used to leave their children in gurukul (a kind of residential school where students live with the teacher for studies). This tradition was greatly supported by the trust and bond between the parents and teachers. Even today, trust is one of the most important factors which motivate parents to get their children admitted in a particular school. A teacher is considered to be the alternate parents; this makes teaching all the more challenging and full of accountability.
</p><p>In recent days, we get to hear a lot about corporal punishment. Some of the teachers get barbaric and beat students so badly that some of them don’t even survive. This is highly restricted in all over India. Though it is important for the teachers to be strict sometimes but there can be alternate methods to punish the students than harming them physically.
</p><p>Well, I would like to end this note with a huge thanks to our teachers who are so caring and compassionate. We are highly honoured to be a part of this School.
</p><p>Thank You!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            2. speech about career as a future CALLCENTER?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My goal is to convince you that call centers have a bright future, and I'm going to do it with a few reasons. This is going to be a really short talk, and I think I can do it in an hour.</p><p>The first thing I'm going to do is ask the audience to think about the question "What if?" I think it's important to ask this question, because it helps me get into the listener's mind. What if you had one year, and the call center was gone? How would you do it? I want to know what you think would happen. I want to find out where you think our industry is going. The truth is, it's hard to tell. It's really hard to predict the future of anything. The reason is that we humans are really bad at it. We tend to be really biased, and we look at the same situation, and we are not like a call center in which all of us have different goals. I want you to pretend that call center that you use was the only call center in the country. And the world was like what it is today. But what would it look like a year from now? What would it look like? Would you still have your job? What would it be like?</p><p>Now, the problem with this is that this is really hard to do. The truth is, call centers are going to be around forever. It's a really good business model. Every company has to have a contact center. Every person has to have a phone. Call centers are going to be part of life. I think there are some good signs, as long as you understand how to be part of the future. If you are, if you understand what your job needs to be to be part of the future, you will be fine. You won't have to stay in the call center forever.</p><p>Now, there are so many reasons. I know that there is so much competition for the jobs right now, but there were so many jobs before. Why was that? Let's think about it. Think about why the call center has been around so long. Why did it work? I think that the reason that the call center worked so well, is that it was the easiest way for people to get in touch with people. People were so used to them. Companies were so used to them that they thought it was fine. They thought that it was the cheapest way to do it. Now, the problem is, call centers are a really bad idea. We don't really need them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Yan lang makakaya ko </p><br />

                        <p>There are certain times in life when everything seems out of our control. Due dates, meetings, homework, etc. There are also times when people try to control our lives by manipulating certain parts of ourselves to fit their desires. It feels as though you are a puppet, dangling on the strings and swayed by random masters -- obeying each command and every word they say. But that is not how one should live. If there is one thing that you should never forget, it should be that you are the author of your life. It is you who makes the decisions. It is for you to decide what makes you happy, and you must pursue that desire no matter what people may think of you. Do not let your dreams be dreams. We only get to live once, so make every decision count. </p><p></p><p>(You may add more if you want to. Hope it helps! :D)</p><br />
