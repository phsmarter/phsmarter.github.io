On the other hand, more than the results and ranking in PISA and other agencies like it, everyone should realize that reading is a very useful skill not only in school, but also in rea life. In fact, the following are just 3 of many benefits in reading can allow us to discover a lot of things, can help us to succeed in school; and can guide us in handling real-life undertakings.​</a>
