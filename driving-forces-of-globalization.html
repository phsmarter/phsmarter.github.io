Organizations play several roles in the regime. Certainly, cooperation among organizations can be the driving force behind the development of an international regime or define its structure; an example is the coordination among national health agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and the World Health Organization. Yet organizations, and cooperation among them, can also be the consequence of or institutionalized manifestation of coordination between different groups or states in the world. International cooperation can also occur outside or independent of organizations, providing the analyst with a broader conception of behavior than is present by a pure concentration on institutional behavior. A focus on organizations and cooperation is also enhanced by understanding the broader milieu in which organizations operate and cooperation emerges (Haas, 1980). The limitations of the regime framework, however, include its difficulty with accommodating change, its being too issue-specific to permit generalizations, and its limited applicability to more structured, less anarchic environments than global politics (for a more detailed critique of this approach, see Strange, 1989).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>it have explanation for you to understand it</p><p></p><p>#carryonlearning</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>FALSE</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong>Eclipses do not happen at every new moon, of course. This is because the moon's orbit is tilted just over 5 degrees relative to Earth's orbit around the sun. For this reason, the moon's shadow usually passes either above or below Earth, so a solar eclipse doesn't occur</p><p>2.<strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>E</strong></p><p>3. <strong>FALSE</strong> ,However, if an eclipse of the Sun occurs when the Moon is somewhat nearer than its average distance, the Moon can completely hide the Sun, producing a total solar eclipse.</p><p>4. <strong>FALSE.</strong><strong>, </strong>The Moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical. The point of the orbit closest to Earth is called <strong>perigee</strong>, while the point farthest from Earth is known as <strong>apogee</strong>.</p><p>5. <strong>TRUE</strong><strong>, </strong>Speed is a scalar quantity while velocity is a vector quantity. This means velocity indicates speed with a direction. If a body is moving with constant velocity, it means the body is moving with a constant speed in a particular direction.</p><p>6. <strong>FALSE</strong>, No weather occurs in the stratosphere. The statosphere contains over 15% of the total mass of the atmosphere, and is where the ozone layer is located. Air temperature slowly increases with height in the stratosphere, in contrast with the troposphere where the temperature rapidly decreases with height.</p><p>7 .<strong>TRUE</strong>, Experimental design means creating a set of procedures to test a <strong>hypothesis</strong>. A good experimental design requires a strong understanding of the system you are studying. </p><p>8. <strong>FALSE</strong>, By far, the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere is <strong>nitrogen</strong>, which accounts for about 78% of the mass of dry air. Oxygen is the next most abundant gas, present at levels of 20 to 21%.</p><p>9. <strong>TRUE</strong>, The Ocean is essential to life on Earth. Most of Earth's water is stored in the ocean</p><p>10. <strong>FALSE</strong>,  <strong>carbon dioxide</strong><strong> </strong>Indeed, carbon dioxide, a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion, is the principal greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. However, other greenhouse gases including methane, nitrous oxide, and a number of industrial-process gases also are important contributors to climate change.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Globalization Creating Backlash of Religious Parochialism
</p><p>
</p><p>Since globalization is considered as “the first truly world revolution,” “all revolutions disrupt the traditions and customs of a people”—that is, “people’s very security, safety, and identity.”[30] As globalization disrupts traditional communities, causes economic marginalization, and brings mental stress, individuals feel these less desirable consequences of globalization. With religion’s power to “convey a picture of security, stability, and simple answers” through stories and beliefs—unlike economic plans, political programs, or legal regulations—individuals turn to religion.[31]
</p><p>
</p><p>First, globalization breaks down traditional communities and replaces them with larger, impersonal organizations. As globalization creates a “global village,” it dramatically alters what individuals traditionally understood themselves by—“citizenship,” “nationality,” and “immigration.”[32] For instance, the European Union (EU) does not call their members by country of origin but rather by their greater title, European citizens. Moreover, such organizations set universal standards upon all members, causing individuals to believe that they are not fairly represented. As a result, feeling that these organizations have shattered their “protective cocoon” that has shielded them in the past, many individuals find comfort in religion.[33</p><p></p><br />

Organizations play several roles in the regime. Certainly, cooperation among organizations can be the driving force behind the development of an international regime or define its structure; an example is the coordination among national health agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and the World Health Organization. Yet organizations, and cooperation among them, can also be the consequence of or institutionalized manifestation of coordination between different groups or states in the world. International cooperation can also occur outside or independent of organizations, providing the analyst with a broader conception of behavior than is present by a pure concentration on institutional behavior. A focus on organizations and cooperation is also enhanced by understanding the broader milieu in which organizations operate and cooperation emerges (Haas, 1980). The limitations of the regime framework, however, include its difficulty with accommodating change, its being too issue-specific to permit generalizations, and its limited applicability to more structured, less anarchic environments than global politics (for a more detailed critique of this approach, see Strange, 1989).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>Globalisation is the process of increased political, social, and economic interaction and integration among people, organisations, and governments. ... For example, Coca-Cola has expanded its business operations globally as a result of globalisation and recognisable brands around the world.</p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>The key driving forces of Globalization includes Economic, Political and Technological factors, establishment of WTO, emergence and growth of regional integration, decline in trade barriers, decline in investment barriers, technological changes, increase in FDI and growth of MNC's.</p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>globalisation is also affecting us in a negative way. Increased transportation and the global shift of polluting manufacturing industries has resulted in environmental degradation. Pollution is affecting people's health and having a negative impact on biodiversity levels globally.</p><p></p><strong>Not </strong><strong>sure </strong><strong>but </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>hope </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>helps!</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Goodluck&lt;</strong><strong>3</strong><br />
