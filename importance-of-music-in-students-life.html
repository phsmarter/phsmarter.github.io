Write your answer in the space before each number. 1. Many people believe that meat is an important food to eat. It is not true. You do not need to eat meat at all In fact, you may be healthier if you do not eat meat 2. Traveling is not always fun. Often there are problems with transportation, language or hotels. It is also very tiring to travel, and you can easily get sick. 3. Nowadays, it is better not to have a camera when you travel. A camera is heavy and difficult to carry. It is also not necessary. You can buy good picture postcards almost everywhere. 4. Riding a bicycle is the best way to see a country. It does not need gas. It is not expensive. You also get to exercise while traveling 5. Bicycles can be very dangerous. You can hurt yourself by falling off the bicycle. You can get seriously hurt if you get into an accident 6. Everyone should learn another language. A second language is very useful these days. It allows you to learn new things about other people, places, and cultures. 7. It is not easy to move to another country. There may be problems with the language or culture. It may be difficult to find a job or a place to live. You also do not have family or friends nearby to ask for help in times of emergencies. 8. Music often makes you feel better about life. It can make you happy if you are sad. It can relax you when you feel nervous. 9. Online classes are only for privileged people. Students that belong to the poorest of the poor families cannot afford to attend online classes because they would rather feed their empty stomachs than spend money for internet connection. 10. Academic freeze would be helpful especially to families who are greatly affected by the pandemic. If the school year will be pushed through, it will surely become an additional burden to those families who are already struggling. ch irabela​</a>

                                            The following is a true story. No names have been changed to protect anyone, as some are still bitter... Way back in my undergraduate days, I was dating a young woman who was becoming an increasingly important part of my life. Things were definitely moving to something beyond being 'boyfriend and girlfriend" - things were getting 'serious'. We were no longer talking about what to do this weekend, but what we might do next year... or after we graduate. You get the picture. So one day I decided to prepare a romantic dinner for the two of us. As a poor undergraduate student struggling to get by, my idea of a home-cooked meal didn't go much further than what can be accomplished with about eight dollars, two pots, and one microwave oven So for this particular and rather momentous moment, I chose to cook up and serve spaghetti and salad.

                                            TRANSCRIPTIONS AND COPY OF ARTICLES, STORIES AND SCRIPT For Exercise 1: EASTERN PHILOSOPHY -CONFUCIUS said to have been born in 551 B.C, in China. He may have been a student of the Daoist me We know very little for certain about the life of the Chinese Philosopher, Confucius. F Minister of crime under Duke Ding in the state of Lu. However, Confucius and the Duke fell out Lao Tzu. According to tradition, he began government service and served many roles including after the duke received a present from a neighboring ruler, 80 beautiful women and 124 horses found deeply improper for a ruler. So he left the court and wandered for years. come Compleats (Lunyu), "a collection of sayings written down by his followers. Some of the morale Around between the 3rd and the 5 century B.C., Confucius works were collected into the Confucius taught are easily recognizable. Most notably his version of the Golden Rule: "Do not or old-fashioned to the modern ears specially to Western ones. But we need his advice all the more 7 Confucius helps us to remember: 1. Ceremony is important, The Analects are filled with strange conversations between Confucius and his disciples like this one: Tze-kung wants to do away with the offering of a sheep. Confucius said, “Tze, you love the sheep, I love the ceremony.” At first this is baffling if not also humorous. Why not save the sheep? But Confucius is reminding Tze and us about the importance of ceremony. In the modern world, we tend to shun ceremony, and see this is a good thing, a sign of intimacy or lacjk of pretension. But Confucius believed in the value of ceremonies over sheep because he valued what he called "Ritual Propriety (Li).” This might seem a very outdated and conservative idea but in fact many of us long for particular rituals. That meal mum cooked for us whenever we were seek or that yearly birthday outing. We understand that certain premeditated, deliberate and precise gestures steer our emotions deeply. Rituals make our intentions clear and they help us to understand how to behave. 2. We should treat or parents with reverence. In particular, Confucius has a very strict idea about how we should behave towards our parents. He believed that we should obey them when we are young, care for them when they are old, mourn at length when they die and make huge sacrifices in their memory thereafter. He even said that we shouldn't travel faraway while our parents are alive and should cover for them when they steal a sheep. This attitude is known as "Filial Piety (Xiao)." This sounds strange now when many of us leave our parents' home as teenagers and rarely return to visit. We may even see them as strangers arbitrarily trust upon us by fate. After all our parents are so out of touch so pitifully human in their shortcomings, so difficult, so judgmental and they have such bad taste in music, Yet Confucius recognized that in many ways moral life begins in the family. We cannot truly be caring, wise, grateful and conscientious unless we remember mum's birthday and meet dad for lunch​</a>

                            8. The following is a true story. No names have been changed to protect anyone, as some are still bitter... Way back in my undergraduate days, I was dating a young woman who was becoming an increasingly important part of my life. Things were definitely moving to something beyond being 'boyfriend and girlfriend" - things were getting 'serious'. We were no longer talking about what to do this weekend, but what we might do next year... or after we graduate. You get the picture. So one day I decided to prepare a romantic dinner for the two of us. As a poor undergraduate student struggling to get by, my idea of a home-cooked meal didn't go much further than what can be accomplished with about eight dollars, two pots, and one microwave oven So for this particular and rather momentous moment, I chose to cook up and serve spaghetti and salad. The table was set. The candles were burning. Adult contemporary alternative music played on a revolutionary audio device called a "CD Player". The salad had been finished. It was time for the main course. I piled spaghetti noodles on my girlfriend's plate and began to ladle Prego sauce over her noodles hot out of the pot. As the sauce poured out of the ladle, a large, cooked cockroach accompanied the sauce onto my girlfriend's plate. Without going into details, there was simply NO WAY that​</h2><br />

                            22. TRANSCRIPTIONS AND COPY OF ARTICLES, STORIES AND SCRIPT For Exercise 1: EASTERN PHILOSOPHY -CONFUCIUS said to have been born in 551 B.C, in China. He may have been a student of the Daoist me We know very little for certain about the life of the Chinese Philosopher, Confucius. F Minister of crime under Duke Ding in the state of Lu. However, Confucius and the Duke fell out Lao Tzu. According to tradition, he began government service and served many roles including after the duke received a present from a neighboring ruler, 80 beautiful women and 124 horses found deeply improper for a ruler. So he left the court and wandered for years. come Compleats (Lunyu), "a collection of sayings written down by his followers. Some of the morale Around between the 3rd and the 5 century B.C., Confucius works were collected into the Confucius taught are easily recognizable. Most notably his version of the Golden Rule: "Do not or old-fashioned to the modern ears specially to Western ones. But we need his advice all the more 7 Confucius helps us to remember: 1. Ceremony is important, The Analects are filled with strange conversations between Confucius and his disciples like this one: Tze-kung wants to do away with the offering of a sheep. Confucius said, “Tze, you love the sheep, I love the ceremony.” At first this is baffling if not also humorous. Why not save the sheep? But Confucius is reminding Tze and us about the importance of ceremony. In the modern world, we tend to shun ceremony, and see this is a good thing, a sign of intimacy or lacjk of pretension. But Confucius believed in the value of ceremonies over sheep because he valued what he called "Ritual Propriety (Li).” This might seem a very outdated and conservative idea but in fact many of us long for particular rituals. That meal mum cooked for us whenever we were seek or that yearly birthday outing. We understand that certain premeditated, deliberate and precise gestures steer our emotions deeply. Rituals make our intentions clear and they help us to understand how to behave. 2. We should treat or parents with reverence. In particular, Confucius has a very strict idea about how we should behave towards our parents. He believed that we should obey them when we are young, care for them when they are old, mourn at length when they die and make huge sacrifices in their memory thereafter. He even said that we shouldn't travel faraway while our parents are alive and should cover for them when they steal a sheep. This attitude is known as "Filial Piety (Xiao)." This sounds strange now when many of us leave our parents' home as teenagers and rarely return to visit. We may even see them as strangers arbitrarily trust upon us by fate. After all our parents are so out of touch so pitifully human in their shortcomings, so difficult, so judgmental and they have such bad taste in music, Yet Confucius recognized that in many ways moral life begins in the family. We cannot truly be caring, wise, grateful and conscientious unless we remember mum's birthday and meet dad for lunch​</h2><br />
