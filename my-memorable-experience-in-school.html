                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Last week, it was my best friend’s birthday. So we all planned a nice birthday party. He asked all of us to come to his house three days before his birthday. It was supposed to be a small tea-party with a few friends and family members. As he is the eldest in the family, he asked me to come and help him with the preparations. A day before, we went to the market and brought the necessary decoration articles. We decided for a few minutes on the food and other things with my friend’s father. We also ordered for the cake from the bakery his father asked us to.</p><p></p><p>We both were really excited, as my friend was turning 16 this year. I decided to go straight at his place after school to help him with the decorations. I had already kept my clothes there, so dressing up was no problem. Both Uncle and Aunty are working, so they too were very glad and relieved with me there to help their son prepare for his birthday party.</p><p></p><p>One our way back home from school, we collected the cake and the eatables that we had ordered the day before. Then we hurried back home. We quickly had our lunch and headed for the drawing-room. We changed the table-cloth, cleaned the room and started with the decorations.</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>​High school life is the best memory of being a student. This is the time when you totally realized that life was full of mysteries. The mystery is a term of experience because at this stage of my life. At this stage was able to know that life is not all about happiness or sadness but this two will be part of and be my best friend in life. I have a lot of experience that molded my personality. That I can use to treasure through the journey of my life. And this is my simple story during my senior high school life. </p><p>             This is how my senior high school life started , first day of school. I felt excited and nervous. Excited in such a way that I will be able to experience another journey of my life. Nervous in the sense that I will be facing new classmates , new teachers and new friends . Nevertheless , the nervous I felt in the first day slowly gone and filled with happiness. I was able to gained new friends . Most of them are my schoolmate and some of them are transferees from other school. I really thought that my senior high school would be very boring ,but I was wrong.  I don’t expect that I would be enjoying with my new friends and my classmates. I really treasure every single days with them , with their craziness in life. </p><p>         As the days passed by, I experienced lots of new things in my life . I was able to eat with my classmates and teacher in what we called “bodol fight”. You’ll be eating with your bare hands only ,no using using of spoons and forks. The foods are placed together in a big banana leaves. I really enjoy eating with them.</p><p>           During our mass demonstration ( mass demonstration), we are so busy . Putting makeup on our faces. Taking pictures. Also, that day is our founders day. That day, will be performing our modern folk dance. I am quite nervous at that day. To be honest , I am not a good dancer. After we perform, I felt relieve. And the good news our dance is the best. We won that time.</p>Hope This Answer Helps :-)Mark This Answer Into BRAINLIEST ^_^Thanks!<br />

                            15. My Most Memorable Experiences in LifeVerbal Irony​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Verbal irony is an excellent tool of the writing trade. It allows readers to exercise a little bit of perception and omniscience. This type of irony occurs when a speaker says one thing but means another.</p><p></p><p>Many people consider verbal irony to be akin to sarcasm. For example, after a hard day at work, we might say the day was, "Really, really spectacular." (Spectacular being in air quotes.) While you might file that under sarcasm, it's actually more of an instance of verbal irony.</p><br />

                            16. Give three Most Memorable Experience in school or with family​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Back when I was 11- I was riding my bike down the street one Sunday afternoon. Then a car shows up behind me and an older girl on her bike all of a sudden is in front of me. So I try to ride through a neighbor's yard to get out of her way- but I end up going into a curb and fall off of my bike.</p><p></p><p>I fell into a wooden fence built around the neighbor's mailbox. My head went right into it and my skin above my left eye got cut. It opened right up and blood started leaking out. The girl then gets off her bike and says she is really sorry.</p><p></p><p>My parents were outside in our front yard right next door and came running over. The girl's dad passes by on his bike and gets off to help. Then the neighbors come out as they heard me screaming. They said they were terribly sorry I got hurt and wanted to know if they could do anything.</p><p></p><p>My mom said she was going in our house and coming back with a wet washcloth to put over my cut. The girl's dad was holding me upward and telling me to NOT lower my head until my mom is back with that washcloth to put on it.</p><p></p><p>That girl was saying she felt really bad and knew it was her fault because I could have kept going forward if she had NOT been there. My mom did come back with the wet washcloth and finally got it over that cut. The washcloth became 'completely red' in less than two minutes.</p><p></p><p>Then my parents thanked that girl's dad for helping and helped me walk to the mini-van we had back then. They said I was being taken to the local clinic where a doctor could give me stitches. My twin brother was told to go get my bike from the neighbor's yard and bring it into the garage where it always is.</p><p></p><p>So we went riding over to the clinic and came in with lots of people already there. We were told that the doctor had to see a lot of other patients before helping us- but he would give me the stitches I needed before the end of the day.</p><p></p><p>A few hours passed with us sitting on a couch looking at the TV in the waiting room. Some nurse did provide me with a bandaged cloth to hold over my cut as the washcloth had gotten yucky. The bleeding eventually stopped and the cut itself just had to be sewn back up.</p><p></p><p>I finally was taken into the doctor's room and we were told he would be with us. My dad took me back there while my mom stayed with my brother in the waiting room. The man eventually walked in and said what he would be doing.</p><p></p><p>He explains that he will be giving me shots in the cut area so I will NOT be able to feel the pain from 'the stitching'. Then he warns me that is going to hurt a little and I need to hold very still as he does it. So he sticks the needles there and it was only as bad as somebody pinching you.</p><p></p><p>After giving me the shots- he then sews up the cut and says the stitches in there will have to stay for up to five days. He tells my dad that I need to be given medicine for it every night and a new band-aid must be put on over the stitches before I go to bed.</p><p></p><p>We finally left after that and I had to go to school the next day. I remember having to give my P.E. teacher a note from the clinic telling her to excuse me from participating in all activities. So I got to just sit down while everyone else was doing the exercises and physical activities.</p><p></p><p>When Friday finally came- my mom picked me up from the school and drove me back to the clinic. We went into the doctor's room and a nurse cut the stitches off. My cut was in the process of healing and I still have a scar in that area from it over 25 years later.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p>#LearnAtBrainly</p><p>#BrainlyOnlineEducation</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>bonding with family and recognition in school</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My unforgettable Experience in
</p><p>the Philippines
</p><p>
</p><p>The Philippines, a country which has a different culture from my country is one of the best places that is close to my heart. Staying here in the Philippines has given me such wonderful and amazing experiences. I will tell you two of my best experiences
</p><p>
</p><p>First, I have met a lot of kind people, especially my teachers in Monol. During my four months stay in Monol, I have been very lucky to study and hang out with my teachers, especially teacher Tedd techer Sophia and teacher faye. They make me Feel that I am not different from them even though I am a foreigner. I really appreciate what they have shown me. I also met many friends in Monol from different countries. These friends made me realize one very important lesson in life - differences in culture is not a barrier in friendship
</p><p>
</p><p>Second I have visited some beautiful and great place in the Philippines. These places are San fernando, and Hundred Islands, I went there with my friends. We did many kinds of interesting activities. This experience is one of the best experiences I would never forget.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        My High School Experience<p></p><p>     When i think about my high school experience, there are many things that come to mind. Some of them are: </p><p></p>good memoriesbad memoriesmistakeslessonshappinessheartbreakmisfortune joydramaand most importantlyfun<p></p><p>High School to me seemed like it past by really fast, almost too fast sometimes. I learned many valuable life lessons as well as made life long friends. </p><p></p><p>I learned the value of hard work, dedication, and also how to tell your real friends from the others. It was tough but overall a great experience that i will soon miss. </p><p></p><p>     When i think about high school and all the memories, some of them were good, an some of them were bad. Most of the good memories involved my good friends and most of the bad memories involved just me. Some examples of good memories in high school is just like going to the different sports games with my friends.</p><p></p><p>My friends and I attended many of the football games, basketball games and some baseball games. The sounds, the atmosphere, and the company of your friends is what makes the events so fun and exciting. </p><p></p><p>Just good memories for me in general in high school include just the basic seeing people in the halls during passing period, doing class projects, attending assemblies, as well as just seeing people in class everyday. </p><p></p><p>         If high school has taught me anything it is that you should always have confidence in yourself. If you believe in yourself and you believe that you can achieve anything you want in life, good things will happen to you. Knowing that I am graduating high school and never coming back hasn't really hit me yet. These 4 years has been an </p><p>overall life changing experience that I will never forget. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>#CarryOnLearningシ︎<br />

                        A great teacher will always lead by example. This is because most of them are aware that if they give their students respect, most of them will return the same. This is a valuable lesson to learn from teachers as it enables one to be more humble and simple in nature.<br />
