Mental Health is important in a person’s life.
Yet it is one of the problems of the youth these days.
Let’s have a quick talk about Mental Health
But First, I am Daniel Andrei Marbibi from 7-Agoncillo.
Mental health is a condition where a person meets his/her emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Mental Health is also triggered by stress caused by “ stressors “ that produce stress.
Stressors are things that produce stress such as bullying, failure, people, and others.
Stress can be classified into two, Eustress and Distress.
Eustress is positive stress and example of these are Winning a competition, having support from your family, and feeling important.
While Distress is negative stress and example of these are being physically abused, being bullied in school, having bad grades, and being scolded by your parents. This is also the cause of depression, anxiety, bad eating habits, insolation, and even worse health habits like smoking, using drugs, and sleeping pills.
When you are feeling these types of Distress, go to some people that can understand you such as your Family, Friends, A Psychotherapist, your teacher, or even your school’s Guidance Counselor.
There is no way to avoid these Mental problems. As we continue our life, we will have these problems over and over again but every time we’ll have them, we can resolve them, and we can learn to get through them with the help of others.
And That is all I am Daniel Andrei Marbibi leaving you with this quote of mine.
“If you have a problem in life, remember it and learn from it as you go through”</a>

One summer, my family and I decided to take a road trip to the countryside. It was a long and tiring journey, but the sight of the rolling hills and vast greenery made it all worth it. We arrived at a small town nestled in the heart of the countryside, and we were greeted by friendly locals who welcomed us with open arms.</p><p></p><p>One of the highlights of our trip was visiting a local farm. We were given a tour of the vast fields where we saw rows upon rows of crops and vegetables. We also saw different farm animals such as cows, pigs, and chickens. It was fascinating to see how everything worked, from the seed planting to the harvesting. We even got to try some of the fresh produce, and it was the best-tasting food I have ever had. I will never forget the feeling of the warm sun on my face as we explored the farm, and the sound of the animals in the background.</p><p></p><p>Paragraph 2:</p><p></p><p>Another unforgettable experience from that trip was when we went hiking in the nearby mountains. We woke up early in the morning and started our ascent up the steep trail. The view was breathtaking, and we were surrounded by the beauty of nature. We saw wildflowers, butterflies, and even a deer. As we reached the top, we were rewarded with a panoramic view of the countryside below. It was a sight that I will never forget.</p><p></p><p>On our way back down, we decided to take a different path that led us to a river. The water was crystal clear, and we could see the fish swimming in it. We took off our shoes and dipped our feet in the cool water. We also found some rocks that we used to skip across the river. It was a fun and relaxing way to end our hike.</p><p></p><p>Overall, that road trip to the countryside was one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life. It taught me the importance of exploring new places and trying out new things. It also showed me the beauty of nature and the simple joys it can bring.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Mental Health is important in a person’s life.
Yet it is one of the problems of the youth these days.
Let’s have a quick talk about Mental Health
But First, I am Daniel Andrei Marbibi from 7-Agoncillo.
Mental health is a condition where a person meets his/her emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Mental Health is also triggered by stress caused by “ stressors “ that produce stress.
Stressors are things that produce stress such as bullying, failure, people, and others.
Stress can be classified into two, Eustress and Distress.
Eustress is positive stress and example of these are Winning a competition, having support from your family, and feeling important.
While Distress is negative stress and example of these are being physically abused, being bullied in school, having bad grades, and being scolded by your parents. This is also the cause of depression, anxiety, bad eating habits, insolation, and even worse health habits like smoking, using drugs, and sleeping pills.
When you are feeling these types of Distress, go to some people that can understand you such as your Family, Friends, A Psychotherapist, your teacher, or even your school’s Guidance Counselor.
There is no way to avoid these Mental problems. As we continue our life, we will have these problems over and over again but every time we’ll have them, we can resolve them, and we can learn to get through them with the help of others.
And That is all I am Daniel Andrei Marbibi leaving you with this quote of mine.
“If you have a problem in life, remember it and learn from it as you go through”</h2><br />

In the second sentence, consider adding "in society" after "youth" to clarify that mental health is a problem among young people in general.</p><p></p><p>2. In the paragraph discussing stress, consider adding a definition of stress itself before introducing stressors. This will help readers understand the concept more fully.</p><p></p><p>3.

It uses the complex grammatical sentence structure and vocabulary that are only known by experts in that field</p><p>2.)Formal Style</p><p>This type uses formal words and expressions and is mostly seen in writing rather than speaking. It also disallows the use of ellipsis, contractions, and qualifying modal adverbials.</p><p>3.)Consultative Style</p><p>The third level of language. It is basically unplanned speech since the speaker uses the participation and feedback of the listener. The speaker will supply background information, while again, the listener participates continuously</p><p>4.)Casual Style</p><p>Also known as informal style, it is usually used between, friends, or even insiders who have things to share. In this type, there is a free and easy participation of both speaker and listener.</p><p>5.)Intimate Style</p><p>The last type is used in talks between two very close individuals. It is described by an economy of words, with a high chance of nonverbal communication. Like casual, there is also a free and easy participation of both speaker and listener.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>just giving a clue</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Paragraph 1: Growing up, I had always dreamed of traveling to different countries and experiencing different cultures. But little did I know that the most unforgettable experience of my life would happen right in my own backyard. It was a beautiful summer day and my friends and I decided to go on a hike in the nearby mountains. We were all excited to take in the beautiful scenery and spend some quality time outdoors. As we started our hike, we came across a beautiful waterfall that was hidden away in a small cove. The sound of the water cascading down the rocks was like music to our ears, and we knew that we had to get closer to it. We scrambled down the rocks using the crevices between them as a ladder. When we finally made it down, we found ourselves in the most enchanting place I have ever seen.Hearing the roar of the waterfall and feeling its mist on my face was an experience like no other. I sat on a rock by the edge of the water watching the sun dance on its surface like diamonds. The water was cool and refreshing and it felt like it was cleansing my soul. As I sat there, I realized how small I was in the grand scheme of things, and yet how important it was to be in the moment and appreciate the beauty that surrounded me. The sound of the birds chirping, the rustle of the leaves, and the sound of the water gushing were like a symphony that stirred my soul. It was like time stood still, and the world revolved around the beauty we found ourselves in. Paragraph 2: As we made our way back up the hill, I realized that this experience has brought us closer together. We had all pushed our limits, overcame our fears, and worked as a team to get to the waterfall, and back up to the trail. We started to sing songs, tell stories, and laugh like we had never done before. I had made memories that would last a lifetime. As we walked back to our cars, I was grateful for the experience and the people that I had shared it with.The feeling of pure joy and contentment stayed with me for days, and in a way, it changed me. It made me appreciate the simple things in life, and it taught me to live in the moment. I realized that I didn't need to travel to far-off lands to find beauty, that it was all around us, waiting to be discovered with just a little bit of effort. The experience showed me that life is meant to be experienced, lived, and savored. It is the memories that we create that will stay with us forever, and in that moment, I knew that I had created a memory that would be with me for the rest of my life.<br />
