After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</a>

Although most teenage pregnancies are unintentional, it still means that there are chances of teens becoming pregnant.

When you feel so low that things you previously enjoyed no longer hold that same joy. You wonder how you ever enjoyed anything at all. You wonder what other people have that you can't get a hold of.

The low is so low that it seems to take over, overwhelming you in a way that you could not have imagined beforehand. Depression - An Open Letter to Someone Struggling by by Jannah Walshe​</a>

They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</h2><br />
