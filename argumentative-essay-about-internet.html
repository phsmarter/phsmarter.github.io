                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Body</p><p></p><p>As the “meat” of the paper, the body is where the main ideas are developed, sources are brought in to support them, and the overall argument is made. Each paragraph within the body should revolve around one major idea and follow the basic guidelines of a paragraph, i.e., topic sentence, idea, support, wrap-up. Outlining is key to writing the paper’s body. With a proper outline, you’ll know how many paragraphs (or ideas) you want to present, what order you want to present them, and what you want to say in them.</p><p>Using the sample outline we created earlier, you can easily see how this paper’s three body paragraphs would be structured, what ideas they will each talk about, and what support will be needed. Notice that each idea/paragraph within the body is supported by evidence. Much of your writing in HCI will demand that you support it with source evidence, so the body is where you would quote, paraphrase, summarize, or present data/information from credible texts.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Celestial bodies like asteroids and comets are “time capsules” that contain information about the history of our solar system, making them interesting targets of studies. The main difference between asteroid and comet is their composition. Asteroids and comets are debris left over from the formation of the moon and planets. Comets are located in the outermost regions of the solar system, while, asteroids are located in a belt between Jupiter and Mars. Occasionally, comets and asteroids change their orbital path due to gravitational disturbances, sometimes bringing them close to a planet. Craters on the moon and planets are evidence of the history of impacts with comets and asteroids.</p><p>Difference Between Asteroid And Comet</p><p>Comets are made of dust, ice, and rock materials, while asteroids are composed of rocky materials and metals. Both the celestial bodies were formed 4.6 billion years ago. Asteroids were formed much closer to the sun where it was impossible for the ice to remain solid. Comets were formed farther away from the sun where the ice remained solid. Comets that approach the Sun lose material with its every orbit around the sun as its ice melts and vaporizes to form the tail known as the coma.</p><p></p><p>Asteroid</p><p>Asteroid orbit the Sun and are small bodies on the solar system. They are made up of metals and rocks and also consist of organic compounds. They are similar to comets but don’t have a coma-like comet. Asteroids tend to have shorter and elliptical orbits. Astronomers have discovered millions of asteroids some that measure hundreds of kilometers across and some as small as dust particles.</p><p></p><p>Comet</p><p>Comets also orbit the Sun and are relatively small bodies of the solar system. When comets approach the sun, some part of their ice melts. When some parts of the ice melt, the other materials vaporize due to the heat of the sun. This results in a glowing halo that extends outwards as though sailing through space. The ice and compounds like ammonia and methane develop a fuzzy cloud-like shell known as the coma. This forms a notable difference between comets and asteroids.  </p><p></p><p>Difference Between Asteroid And Comet</p><p>Now that we have an idea of what asteroid and comets are let us write down the differences between them in a tabular column. The comparison between asteroid and comet in tabular form is given below.</p><p></p><p>Difference Between Asteroid and Comet</p><p>Asteroid	Comet</p><p>Asteroids have an elliptical orbit	Comets have an eccentric orbit.</p><p>It is made of metals and rocks	Made of rocks, hydrocarbons, and ice</p><p>Do not produce a coma or tail atmosphere	Thin, temporary atmospheric tail when close to the Sun.</p><p>The orbital period is 1 to 100 years	The orbital periods are 75 to more than 100,000 years.</p><p>1 to larger than 100 kilometers in size	1 to 10 kilometer in size (nucleus only)</p><p></p><p>Hope it's helps</p><p>Don't forget to Love Rate and make me Brainliest</p><p></p><br />

                        Preserving biodiversity is crucial for maintaining a healthy and sustainable ecosystem. The most compelling argument for preserving biodiversity is that it ensures the survival of various species and their habitats. Every species plays a vital role in the ecosystem, and the loss of one can have a domino effect on the entire system. Additionally, preserving biodiversity can lead to the discovery of new medicines and technologies that can benefit human health and well-being.  <br /><br /><br />The argument that seems most likely to convince people that biodiversity should be preserved is the economic benefits it provides. Biodiversity supports various industries such as agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, which contribute significantly to the global economy. Furthermore, ecotourism is a growing industry that relies on the preservation of natural habitats and wildlife. By preserving biodiversity, we can ensure the sustainability of these industries and the livelihoods of people who depend on them.<br />

                            21. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?
