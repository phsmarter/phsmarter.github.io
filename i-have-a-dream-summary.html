How I wish I could make one also," hesaid to himself.The next day, he visited his friend Lucas who happened to be busy doingsomething. "Hello Lucas, how are you? It seems you are busy," said Lucio. "Yesmy friend, I am trying to make an eagle-shaped kite. I would love to fly this as soonas I am done fixing it," answered Lucas." Can I go with you?" asked Lucio. 'Sure,my friend, together we will fly my kite," replied Lucas.Lucio and Lucas had a good time flying the eagle-shaped kite together withthe other children in the cornfield. The eagle-shaped kite glided through the air andflew higher and higher above the sky. In a few moments, Lucas tried to pull thestring but something went wrong. The eagle-shaped kite was caught tied in abranch of a mango tree. Lucas was so worried on what to do." Stay here Lucas. Iwill climb the mango tree and get your kite." After several minutes, Lucio camedown from the tree and brought his friend's kite."Thank you Lucio, you are such a helpful friend. So I will be giving you thiskite of mine. It is all yours.

                                            All my life, I have been driven by one dream, one goal, one vision: To overthrow a farm labor system in this nation which treats farm workers as if they were not important human beings.  Farm workers are not agricultural implements—they are not beasts of burden to be used and discarded. . . .  . . . My motivation comes from my personal life—from watching what my mother and father went through when I was growing up—from what we experienced as migrant farm workers in California.  That dream, that vision, grew from my own experience with racism—with hope—with the desire to be treated fairly and to see my people treated as human beings and not as chattel.  It grew from anger and rage—emotions I felt 40 years ago when people of my color were denied the right to see a movie or eat at a restaurant in many parts of California.  It grew from the frustration and humiliation I felt as a boy who couldn't understand how the growers could abuse and exploit farm workers when there were so many of us and so few of them.Which ideas from the excerpt would be most appropriate to include in a summary?

                        <p>Martin Luther King Jr. begins his speech by referencing the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation and the beacon of hope it provided for African Americans. The image shows the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in 1863.</p><p>Next, he continues on to describe the injustice and segregation that African Americans are facing. The image shows an African American in the back of a police car.</p><p>King states that this is just the beginning and there will be no backing down until African Americans are considered equal. The man in the image is wearing a picket sign that is encouraging the end of segregation.</p><p>Next, King demands that people maintain their dignity and discipline; he does not want people to resort to violence. The image shows a young man peacefully sitting in a restaurant that refused to serve African Americans.</p><p>He continues to encourage people to have faith and to press on until his dream is realized and citizens of different races can live together peacefully. The image is of an African American who continues to pray and have faith in the movement.</p><p>King ends the speech preaching about all of God’s children across the United States being able to live in a free and equal world. The image used is a photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. delivering his “I Have a Dream” speech during the March on Washington.</p><br /><br />

                        <p>Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous "I Have A Dream" speech on August 28, 1963. One of its most powerful lines reads, "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Knowing that three different news stations would be in attendance that day, King wrote a speech in advance. Moved by the emotion of the crowd, however, he went off script and began preaching from the heart.
</p><p>
</p><p>King references the beliefs of the Founding Fathers, who declared that America would be a land of freedom where all men are created equal.
</p><p>
</p><p>Throughout the speech, King repeats the phrases "I have a dream" and "with this faith" in his dream, using the rhetorical strategy of repetition to drive home his point.</p><br />

                            10. The Eagle KiteIn a dry cornfield near a nipa hut, sat a boy who is looking amazingly at theblue sky. Lucio enjoyed gazing at the different shapes of kites flying freely abovethe clouds. "Wow, they are so colourful! How I wish I could make one also," hesaid to himself.The next day, he visited his friend Lucas who happened to be busy doingsomething. "Hello Lucas, how are you? It seems you are busy," said Lucio. "Yesmy friend, I am trying to make an eagle-shaped kite. I would love to fly this as soonas I am done fixing it," answered Lucas." Can I go with you?" asked Lucio. 'Sure,my friend, together we will fly my kite," replied Lucas.Lucio and Lucas had a good time flying the eagle-shaped kite together withthe other children in the cornfield. The eagle-shaped kite glided through the air andflew higher and higher above the sky. In a few moments, Lucas tried to pull thestring but something went wrong. The eagle-shaped kite was caught tied in abranch of a mango tree. Lucas was so worried on what to do." Stay here Lucas. Iwill climb the mango tree and get your kite." After several minutes, Lucio camedown from the tree and brought his friend's kite."Thank you Lucio, you are such a helpful friend. So I will be giving you thiskite of mine. It is all yours. I will be making another one, so we can fly our kitestogether," said Lucas. Lucio was so happy because he had already a kite which hereally dreamed to have. summary​ </h2><br />

                            12. All my life, I have been driven by one dream, one goal, one vision: To overthrow a farm labor system in this nation which treats farm workers as if they were not important human beings.  Farm workers are not agricultural implements—they are not beasts of burden to be used and discarded. . . .  . . . My motivation comes from my personal life—from watching what my mother and father went through when I was growing up—from what we experienced as migrant farm workers in California.  That dream, that vision, grew from my own experience with racism—with hope—with the desire to be treated fairly and to see my people treated as human beings and not as chattel.  It grew from anger and rage—emotions I felt 40 years ago when people of my color were denied the right to see a movie or eat at a restaurant in many parts of California.  It grew from the frustration and humiliation I felt as a boy who couldn't understand how the growers could abuse and exploit farm workers when there were so many of us and so few of them.Which ideas from the excerpt would be most appropriate to include in a summary? Select two options.</h2><br />
                        <p>The idea of racism being prominent during the boy's time and how most of his freedom was limited, given that those who were the opposite of his race were given the upper hand and privelege of ruling over them as though they were lesser being. Another could be how he was raised in California, opening his eyes to the world around him with desire to overthrow the nation's farm labor system as he sees no justice in it.</p><br />
