                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Bullying is an aggressive behavior that is hurtful and often cause embarrassment and intimidates the person being bullied. This can happen to anyone. The people being bullied often feels powerless and alone. Bullying isn’t just punching someone in the face or someone calling horrible names. Bullying is a lot more than that. Bullying isn’t new to the society, it existed long ago but thanks to the development of technology people especially teenagers are now being bullied at home. Cyberbullying is a serious problem that can leave the victims feeling helpless and overwhelmed. This has become one of the most difficult issues to resolve in our society today.</p><p></p><p><strong>If</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you </strong><strong>feel</strong><strong> </strong><strong>like</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lacks </strong><strong>words</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong>graphs</strong><strong> </strong><strong>which</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>obvious</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Feel free </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>add</strong><strong> </strong><strong>some</strong><strong> </strong><strong>more</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> </strong><strong>just</strong><strong> </strong><strong>them</strong><strong> </strong><strong>so</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> </strong><strong>could</strong><strong> </strong><strong>create</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong>graphs</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Luck</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer: Cyberbullying can affect a person's mental health. It is because it could make the person's confidence go down. It can also may lead to suicide which is very dangerous.</p><p></p><br />
                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="essay-about-cause-and-effect-about-cyber-bullying">
                            7. Essay about cause and effect about cyber bullying</h2><br />
                        <strong></strong>Most people know that bullying is wrong. Calling someone names has absolutely no beneficial purpose. Moreover, hitting someone makes a bully feel good in the moment while doing permanent damage to the person being victimized. With the Internet, people now have even more opportunities to bully through cyberbullying. This includes sending crude pictures, posting fake web pages, or tweeting slanderous messages. Cyberbullying has subsequently led to a rise in a completely new kind of bullying.<p>One of the effects of bullying is that it can change the victim’s personality. It can cause people who are normally confident and happy to become self-conscious, shy, and unsure. Additionally, victims of bullying may also become sad or depressed. Their confidence might completely disappear, keeping them from trying new things or trusting people. Once a person has been bullied, they may hesitate to participate in situations where he or she might be ridiculed, such as in public speaking or in sports. A bullying victim might even begin to possess previously absent anxious<br />behavior.</p><p>Despite all the negative effects of bullying, there are even far more serious consequences. People who have been bullied sometimes become so upset, scared, or depressed that they see no worth in themselves and no way out of their torment. There have been countless reports over the past few years of students committing suicide because they were bullied. Meanwhile, there are times when victims see no recourse but to seek revenge by serious acts of violence against the bully and instigators. As a result of bullying, people can lose their ability to love and trust, denying them the chance to experience a quality relationship later in their life. They might find themselves as a submissive partner or they may want to be completely alone. Compounding all of these problems, victims often develop eating disorders, begin to self-injure, or require extensive counseling. Social bullying can also leave people without a supportive group of friends that they can lean on and spend time with.</p><p>Another unfortunate consequence of this is that bullying is often cyclical. People who have been bullied can, in an attempt to gain their power and self-esteem back, become bullies themselves. In relation to this, bullies who are not confronted or stopped may find themselves in future positions where they can bully as adults. This is where manipulative bosses and child abusers come from.</p><p>Aside from its long-term effects, some consequences of bullying can be seen and felt immediately. When one child calls another child names, the victim might cry and a bruise might appear after a punch to the arm. However, some effects of bullying are not always obvious to the naked eye. The results of bullying might grow and appear over time, damaging a person in profound ways for the long term. There are so many effects of bullying that they are impossible to count or predict. This is why it is so important to stop bullying.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Cyberbullying is a problem in societies that are advanced enough to have the technology to connect with other people online and is not easily fixable.  Cyberbullying can affect anyone but is most prominent in today’s youth.  If we can curve out this awful behavior early in their age, they are unlikely to continue down that path.   Unfortunately this is not an easy task.  This will require schools, and especially parents to be aware of the problem and act on it.  Eliminating cyberbullying will take a combined effort and wont be eliminated over night.  If the government is willing to accept that cyberbullying is a problem, laws can be put in place to help discourage this activity.  Even still, parents and schools should eliminate and stop this behavior now, then laws shouldn’t be necessary.  So schools and parents, be aware of what kids are doing on the internet and their phones, and act if they are doing something that they shouldn’t be.</p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>Human rights are said to be universal rights that every person is entitled to regardless of his/her gender, caste, creed, religion, culture, social/ economic status or location. These are norms that depict certain standards of human behaviour and are protected by law.</p><p></p><p>Basic Human Rights</p><p></p><p>Human rights have been divided into two broad categories. These are the civil and political rights, and the social rights that also include the economic and cultural rights.  Here is a detailed look at the basic human rights given to every individual:</p><p></p><p>Right to Life</p><p></p><p>Every human being on earth has the right to live. Each individual has the right of not being killed by anyone and this right is protected by the law. However, this right is subject to issues such as death penalty, self defence, abortion, euthanasia and war.</p><p></p><p>Freedom of Speech</p><p></p><p>Every human being has the right to speak freely and voice his opinions in public. However, this right comes with certain limitations such as obscenity, slur and crime provocation.</p><p></p><p>Freedom of Thought, Conscience and Religion</p><p></p><p>Every state gives its citizens the right to think freely and form conscientious beliefs. An individual also has the right to follow any religion of his choice and change it as per his free will at any point in time.</p><p></p><p>Right to Fair Trial</p><p></p><p>Under this right every individual has the right to fair trial by impartial court, right to be heard within reasonable time, right to counsel, right to public hearing and right to interpretation.</p><p></p><p>Freedom from Torture</p><p></p><p>As per the international law, every individual has the right to freedom from torture. This has been prohibited since the mid 20th century.</p><p></p><p>Freedom of Movement</p><p></p><p>This means that every individual has the right to travel, live, work or study in any part of the state he resides in.</p><p></p><p>Freedom from Slavery</p><p></p><p>As per this right, slavery and slave trades are prohibited in every form. However, unfortunately these ill practices still go on illegally.</p><p></p><p>Violation of Human Rights</p><p></p><p>While every human being is entitled to human rights, these rights are often violated. The violation of these rights occurs when actions by state ignore, deny or abuse these rights.</p><p> </p><p>Human rights are the basic rights given to every individual. Known to be universal, these rights are guarded by the law.  However, unfortunately many a times these are violated by states, individuals or groups. It is almost inhuman to deprive a person of these basic rights. This is the reason why many organizations have been established to guard these rights.</p><br />

                            19. persuasive essay about cyber bullying​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyber bullying is a serious problem in today's digital world, and it is a form of harassment that can have long-lasting effects on the victim. As more and more people spend their time online, cyber bullying has become a pervasive issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. In this essay, I will argue that cyber bullying is a harmful and destructive behavior that must be stopped.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, cyber bullying can have serious psychological effects on the victim. It can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Many victims of cyber bullying also experience social isolation and difficulty forming relationships, which can have a lasting impact on their well-being.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, cyber bullying can lead to physical harm. In some cases, victims of cyber bullying have been driven to self-harm or suicide. This is a tragic outcome that is entirely preventable if we take action to stop cyber bullying.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, cyber bullying can have a negative impact on academic performance. Students who are bullied may struggle to focus on their studies, leading to poor grades and lower academic achievement.</p><p></p><p>In order to combat cyber bullying, we must take a multifaceted approach. Parents, teachers, and other adults must be vigilant in monitoring the online activity of young people and take action if they suspect cyber bullying is occurring. Social media companies must also take responsibility for monitoring their platforms and responding quickly to reports of cyber bullying. We can also promote awareness and education about the impact of cyber bullying through public awareness campaigns and school programs.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cyber bullying is a destructive behavior that can have serious long-term consequences. It is up to all of us to take action to prevent and stop cyber bullying in our communities. By working together, we can create a safer and more positive digital world for all.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>low bat na ako huhhhuhh</strong></p><p></p><br />
