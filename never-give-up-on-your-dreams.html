STEP JUAN
Tomas Leonor, a graduate of Fine Arts from the University of the Philippines, founded and organized Step Juan, an expedition that aims to raise funds for children with cancer. He is a freelance artist and a mountaineer. He volunteers for some environment organizations.
When he was a small boy, he suffered a few health problems. His dream was to travel around the Philippines. In 2009, he started to travel but by foot to help children with cancer. He started from the northern part of the Philippines. He earned 1.5 million pesos from walking around Luzon. By 2012, he earned Php 500, 000 more. The amount was earmarked for his project of helping children with cancer. He gives medical aid and promotes public awareness about the plight of these children.
Tomas is a true modern Filipino hero. He is hardworking, persevering, and helpful. He gave up convenience for the sake of others. He never gave up hope on the children of our country. He does what is best for others and cares for them more than he cares for himself.
According to Tomas: “Real success is when you know in your heart that you have given it all your best and you have not used or stepped on anyone in order to reach that goal.”

Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive
They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones, they'll run into smoke
When the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs
Scars collected all their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts
And avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm
Just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (when the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
When the world is calling out your name
Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die</a>

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

STEP JUAN
Tomas Leonor, a graduate of Fine Arts from the University of the Philippines, founded and organized Step Juan, an expedition that aims to raise funds for children with cancer. He is a freelance artist and a mountaineer. He volunteers for some environment organizations.
When he was a small boy, he suffered a few health problems. His dream was to travel around the Philippines. In 2009, he started to travel but by foot to help children with cancer. He started from the northern part of the Philippines. He earned 1.5 million pesos from walking around Luzon. By 2012, he earned Php 500, 000 more. The amount was earmarked for his project of helping children with cancer. He gives medical aid and promotes public awareness about the plight of these children.
Tomas is a true modern Filipino hero. He is hardworking, persevering, and helpful. He gave up convenience for the sake of others. He never gave up hope on the children of our country. He does what is best for others and cares for them more than he cares for himself.
According to Tomas: “Real success is when you know in your heart that you have given it all your best and you have not used or stepped on anyone in order to reach that goal.”

Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive
They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones, they'll run into smoke
When the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs
Scars collected all their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts
And avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm
Just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (when the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
When the world is calling out your name
Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</h2><br />
