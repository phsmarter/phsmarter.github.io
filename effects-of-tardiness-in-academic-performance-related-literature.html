                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The research gap in this topic could be the lack of studies that specifically investigate the effects of taking an unwanted track on the academic performance of grade 11 students. While there are studies that explore the factors that influence students' choices of academic tracks, there is a paucity of research on the consequences of being forced or limited in terms of their choice of track and how this can impact their academic performance.</p><p></p><p>Existing literature suggests that students' academic performance is affected by various factors such as their motivation, study habits, socio-economic status, and support from family and peers. However, there is a need to explore how taking an unwanted track can affect these factors and in turn, influence the academic performance of students.</p><p></p><p>One possible connection between the research gap and existing literature is the potential impact of taking an unwanted track on students' motivation and engagement in school. Students who feel that they are not in the right track may experience a lack of motivation and interest in their studies, which can negatively affect their academic performance. Studies on the relationship between motivation and academic performance could provide insights into how taking an unwanted track can influence students' motivation and in turn, their academic achievement.</p><p></p><p>Another possible connection is the effect of limited choices on students' sense of identity and self-efficacy. Students who are not able to choose the academic track they want may feel that they have less control over their lives and are not able to pursue their interests and passions. This can lead to a loss of self-efficacy and a decrease in academic confidence, which can affect their academic performance. Research on self-efficacy and academic achievement could shed light on how taking an unwanted track can impact students' sense of identity and self-efficacy.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the effects of taking an unwanted track on the academic performance of grade 11 students is an important topic that requires further exploration. By identifying the gaps in existing literature and understanding the potential connections between these gaps, future studies can provide a more comprehensive understanding of how limited choices can influence students' academic performance.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

The impact of students social skills on their academic performance in high school </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p></p><p>Social skills are a set of abilities that enable individuals to interact and communicate effectively with others in various social situations. These skills are essential for success in both personal and professional life. In high school, students' social skills are crucial to their academic performance as they need to interact with their peers, teachers, and other members of the school community. This literature review aims to explore the impact of students' social skills on their academic performance in high school.</p><p></p><p>Social Skills and Academic Performance</p><p></p><p>According to research, students' social skills have a significant impact on their academic performance. Studies have shown that students who possess good social skills tend to perform better academically than those who lack social skills. This is because students with good social skills are more likely to engage in positive social interactions with their peers and teachers, which can enhance their learning experience.</p><p></p><p>One study found that students with strong social skills had higher grades, better attendance, and fewer discipline problems than those who lacked social skills. The researchers also found that students with good social skills were more likely to participate in extracurricular activities and had a higher likelihood of graduating from high school.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, research has shown that social skills are essential for effective communication, problem-solving, and decision-making. Students who possess these skills can collaborate effectively with their peers, work well in groups, and communicate their ideas and thoughts clearly. These abilities can enhance their academic performance by enabling them to participate in class discussions, ask questions, and express their opinions.</p><p></p><p>The Importance of Social Skills Development</p><p></p><p>Given the importance of social skills in high school students' academic performance, it is crucial to develop these skills in students. Schools can play a vital role in social skills development by providing opportunities for students to practice and enhance their social skills. These opportunities can include group projects, team-building activities, and social-emotional learning programs.</p><p></p><p>Social-emotional learning programs are designed to teach students social skills, emotional intelligence, and self-awareness. These programs can help students develop empathy, self-control, and problem-solving skills, which can enable them to interact positively with their peers and teachers.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, students' social skills have a significant impact on their academic performance in high school. Students who possess good social skills tend to perform better academically than those who lack social skills. Therefore, it is essential to develop students' social skills through various opportunities provided by schools. Social-emotional learning programs can also play a vital role in enhancing students' social skills, emotional intelligence, and self-awareness, leading to better academic performance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#KeepOnLearning</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A Literature Review of Academic Performance, an Insight into Factors and their Influences on Academic Outcomes of Students at Senior High Schools</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Abstract</p><p>The good academic performance of students at the Senior High School is of paramount importance in every educational system. Meanwhile, numerous factors influence the academic performance of students and have been researched, but many problems persist. A literature review in this area would provide the gaps and areas that need more research and will go a long way to curb the situation. The current paper used a narrative review method to review the literature on the academic performance of students at Senior High Schools and various factors affecting students’ performance. The paper elucidated how these factors negatively affect academic performance and the need for them to be minimized to improve students’ academic performance. The study found out that, truancy affects academic performance drastically and sometimes even leads to school dropout. Also, the study found out that other factors such as students’ parental levels of education and income, textbooks availability and accessibility, libraries, practical laboratory, meals provision and teachers have tremendous effects on the academic performance of students at school. Students who are above average academically and are positively exposed to these factors are likely to perform better as compared to those who are less exposed to these factors. The study recommends that factors such as truancy, parental levels of education and income, textbooks availability and accessibility, libraries, practical laboratory, meals provision and teachers should be regularly monitored and adjusted to meet students’ needs and aspirations. This will go a long way to improve the academic performance of students and hence allow them to achieve their aims in life.</p><p><strong>t</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>l</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Study</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>d</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>O</strong><strong>K</strong><strong> </strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One study found that children from broken families have a higher likelihood of experiencing emotional and behavioral problems, which can negatively impact their academic performance. These problems may include anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, which can make it difficult for them to focus on their studies and perform well in school.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, children from broken families may also have a harder time adapting to new environments and building relationships, which can lead to social isolation and further difficulties in school. They may also face financial difficulties and lack of emotional and academic support from their parents, which can affect their academic performance.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the specific subject of Grade 12 Humanities and Social Sciences, students from broken families may have a harder time understanding and engaging with the material, as well as completing assignments and participating in class discussions.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, children from broken families are at a greater risk of experiencing a range of difficulties that can negatively affect their academic performance. This is particularly relevant for students studying humanities and social sciences as the subject matter often requires critical thinking, emotional intelligence and good social skills to succeed. Therefore, it is important for educators and parents to be aware of the potential challenges that children from broken families may face and provide them with the necessary support to overcome them.</p><br />

                            29. review related literature Impact of New Normal Education to Students Academic Performance​</h2><br />
                        This study addressed increasingly important issues of student success, withdrawal and perception of the learning environment across multiple course modalities. Arguably these components form the crux of how we will make more effective decisions about how blended learning configures itself in the new normal. The results reported here indicate that blending maintains or increases access for most student cohorts and produces improved success rates for minority and non-minority students alike. In addition, when students express their beliefs about the effectiveness of their learning environments, blended learning enjoys the number one rank. However, upon more thorough analysis of key elements students view as important in their learning, external and demographic variables have minimal impact on those decisions. For example college (i.e. discipline) membership, course level or modality, expected grade or desire to take a particular course have little to do with their course ratings. The characteristics they view as important relate to clear establishment and progress toward course objectives, creating an effective learning environment and the instructors’ effective communication. If in their view those three elements of a course are satisfied they are virtually guaranteed to evaluate their educational experience as excellent irrespective of most other considerations. While end of course rating protocols are summative the three components have clear formative characteristics in that each one is directly related to effective pedagogy and is responsive to faculty development through units such as the faculty center for teaching and learning. We view these results as encouraging because they offer potential for improving the teaching and learning process in an educational environment that increases the pressure to become more responsive to contemporary student lifestyles.<br />
