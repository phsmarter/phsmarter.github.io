                                            Directions: Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow. The Influence of Video Games to Children Video games have been a part of children's life for the past few decades. It all started when Atari came up with its first gaming consul, which included a very simple game of tennis. The controller had just 1 stick and 1 button to play with. Now, we have many different types of consuls available in the market with very complex games that requires controllers with two or more sticks and a variety of buttons. Video games are almost second nature to the modern children and they are more comfortable playing them. Playing video games can have many different effects (both positive as well as negative) on children. Some of this effects include increasing hand eye coordination and increasing dexterity mental skills; a decrease interest in other interest such as studies and sports; and a very negative effect of inducing violence. One of the most positive effects of video games is increasing the dexterity of a child and improving his or her hand eye coordination. As mentioned earlier, the new video games that are coming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds of sticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to make the fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. This allows them to think quickly and improves their re The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and movements for the children to control the characters. This helps in making th much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives. 2/4 Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addicted to playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from their other responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities. Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens than playing real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many health related problems for children, as they can get obese if. they don't exercise ad stay home playing video games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children. Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they are urging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video games consuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actually get up and move. Many researchers have talked about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how it affects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actually participating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allow children to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, and commit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on the children as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it is alright. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven or disproven as of yet. We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as well as negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving their reflexes, the cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as their becoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educators take up this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children to divide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies and other responsibilities.

Indeed, mummies several thousands of years old have been discovered nearly intact. Their skin, hair, teeth, nails, and facialfeatures are still evident. This process was remarkably effective. Basically, mummification consisted of removing the internal organs, applying natural preservatives inside and outside, and then wrapping the body in layers of bandages. Their diseases in life, such as smallpox, arthritis, and nutritional deficiencies, are still diagnosable. Even their fatal afflictions are still apparent: a middle-aged Egyptian king died from a blow to the head; a child-king died from polio. The ancient Egyptians were masters of preserving dead bodies by mummifying them.2. Producers promote their products in magazines, newspapers, posters, and also through television and radio.Our life is influenced by advertising without realizing that we are cheated by the producers who used advertisements to promote their products. Advertising is a kind of business tool that is used by producers to attract people's attention to buy their products. Advertisements also seem like news of fashions, and styles. Whether we realize it or not, advertising brings more negative than positive effects.please pa answer po ibebrainliest kopo kayo pagnaka tama​</a>

As mentioned earlier, the new video games that arecoming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds ofsticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to makethe fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. Thisallows them to think quickly and improves their reflexes. The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and accurate movements for the children to control thecharacters. This helps in making the children much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives.Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addictedto playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from theirother responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities.Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens thanplaying real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many healthrelated problems for children, as they can get obese if they don't exercise ad stay home playingvideo games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children.Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they areurging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video gamesconsuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actuallyget up and move.Many researchers have talk about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how itaffects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actuallyparticipating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allowchildren to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, andcommit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on thechildren as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it isalrighi. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven ordisproven as of yet.We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as wellas negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving theirreflexes. The cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as theirbecoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educatorstakeup this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children todivide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies andother responsibilities.- (Source: www.tailoredessays.com/samples/video-games-affect-children-essay.htm)1.

                                            Biteable, we like to think we know a thing or two about creating great video commercials and ads. For fun, we decided to pool together some of our favourite commercials of all time to provide inspiration for your next video ad.What makes a great TV commercial or video ad?Since the very first television commercial ran — for $9 — more than 75 years ago, television advertising has grown into a $75 billion/year industry. Though TV’s market share has dropped as many viewers cut the cord, internet advertising has ensured that video ads are more popular than ever.So what does it take to make a good ad? Well, as you’ll see in the examples below, there are a few common traits the best commercials share.They’re memorable: From “Wassup!” to “Where’s the Beef?” the most successful ads have a way of ingraining themselves in your memory (whether you want them to or not!) Today’s average urbanite sees some 5000 advertising messages in a single day. Your job, as an advertiser, is to cut through the noise and stand out with a message that’s relevant, different, and effectively represents your brand identity.They’re shareworthy: For maximum exposure, your ad should make people want to talk about it with other people, both in real life and on social media. Usually the ads that inspire that kind of dialogue have elicited some kind of emotional reaction: they’re funny, shocking, weird, or emotionally touching.They communicate the brand’s values: The best ads capture the brand’s voice and identity, and communicate the ethos behind the company. Your audience should watch the ad and think, “this brand is for people like me.”Call to action: Lastly, an effective commercial makes it clear what it wants you to do next, whether it’s to visit a website, lease a car, or buy some candy. While some advertisers skip this step, incorporating the brand more subtly or focusing on awareness, you can really only get away with this if you’re already a household name like Nike or Apple.Create your perfect video in minutesGet started for free.Make a video — it’s free!Funniest CommercialsLet’s get this out of the way: humor is hard. What’s hilarious to one person might be downright annoying to another. When it’s effective, a funny ad can grab attention and inspire positive feelings for a brand. But a joke that falls flat can do the opposite, or even inspire a negative backlash.Moreover, experts are split on whether even a hilarious, popular ad will actually translate to increased revenue and awareness. In some cases, a funny ad can cause a so-called “vampire effect” in which viewers remember the ad, but not the product or company it’s associated with.The key, it seems, is to strike just the right balance between being funny, relevant, and informative. Here are some of the most effective, and funniest commercials we’ve seen:Old Spice: “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” (2010)When Old Spice realized that women made the majority of purchasing decisions when it came to men’s body wash products, they took a different approach with their next campaign. While the tagline “don’t let your man smell like a woman,” might not fly these days, the genuinely funny non-sequitur dialogue and Isaiah Mustafa’s perfect delivery made it a massive hit.Old Spice’s ad was perhaps the pinnacle of the absurdist, unpredictable, meme-able humor many advertisers have embraced, in hopes of creating a viral hit. And it worked. The ad took home nearly every major industry award that year and currently stands at over 55 million views on YouTube. Old Spice, meanwhile, has continued to hone their off-beat brand voice with a hugely popular follow-up campaign starring actor Terry Crews.Reebok: “Terry Tate, Office Linebacker” (2003)Slapstick violence: since the earliest days of comedy it’s been a foolproof way to make ‘em laugh. Reebok’s Super Bowl XXXVII ad had plenty, along with an amusing premise (boosting office productivity), an element of surprise, and solid one-liners and delivery.The spot was roundly praised by critics and viewers alike that year, though whether it actually succeeded in boosting Reebok’s brand is questionable. According to one poll after it aired, just 55% of viewers recalled that the ad was affiliated with Reebok. Though Reebok considered it nonetheless a success, citing a 4-fold increase in online sales, it’s still a good reminder to consider whether misaligned subject matter may cause your ad to become a victim of the ​</a>

DISCUSSION
Opinions about many things could lead to a lot of fallacies. Highly opinionated superstar could
influence a lot of people. Sometimes this movie stars promote illegal drugs which could make a lot of young
people follow their idol. Like the use of Marijuana for example, some people promote them but authorities in
many countries that its negative effect out weight the positive effect. So to say that Marijuana is good for the
health this remains an opinion.

                            5. Directions: Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow. The Influence of Video Games to Children Video games have been a part of children's life for the past few decades. It all started when Atari came up with its first gaming consul, which included a very simple game of tennis. The controller had just 1 stick and 1 button to play with. Now, we have many different types of consuls available in the market with very complex games that requires controllers with two or more sticks and a variety of buttons. Video games are almost second nature to the modern children and they are more comfortable playing them. Playing video games can have many different effects (both positive as well as negative) on children. Some of this effects include increasing hand eye coordination and increasing dexterity mental skills; a decrease interest in other interest such as studies and sports; and a very negative effect of inducing violence. One of the most positive effects of video games is increasing the dexterity of a child and improving his or her hand eye coordination. As mentioned earlier, the new video games that are coming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds of sticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to make the fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. This allows them to think quickly and improves their re The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and movements for the children to control the characters. This helps in making th much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives. 2/4 Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addicted to playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from their other responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities. Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens than playing real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many health related problems for children, as they can get obese if. they don't exercise ad stay home playing video games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children. Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they are urging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video games consuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actually get up and move. Many researchers have talked about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how it affects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actually participating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allow children to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, and commit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on the children as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it is alright. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven or disproven as of yet. We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as well as negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving their reflexes, the cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as their becoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educators take up this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children to divide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies and other responsibilities.

Their skin, hair, teeth, nails, and facialfeatures are still evident. This process was remarkably effective. Basically, mummification consisted of removing the internal organs, applying natural preservatives inside and outside, and then wrapping the body in layers of bandages. Their diseases in life, such as smallpox, arthritis, and nutritional deficiencies, are still diagnosable. Even their fatal afflictions are still apparent: a middle-aged Egyptian king died from a blow to the head; a child-king died from polio. The ancient Egyptians were masters of preserving dead bodies by mummifying them.2. Producers promote their products in magazines, newspapers, posters, and also through television and radio.Our life is influenced by advertising without realizing that we are cheated by the producers who used advertisements to promote their products. Advertising is a kind of business tool that is used by producers to attract people's attention to buy their products. Advertisements also seem like news of fashions, and styles.

The cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as theirbecoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educatorstakeup this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children todivide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies andother responsibilities.- (Source: www.tailoredessays.com/samples/video-games-affect-children-essay.htm)1.

                            10. Biteable, we like to think we know a thing or two about creating great video commercials and ads. For fun, we decided to pool together some of our favourite commercials of all time to provide inspiration for your next video ad.What makes a great TV commercial or video ad?Since the very first television commercial ran — for $9 — more than 75 years ago, television advertising has grown into a $75 billion/year industry. Though TV’s market share has dropped as many viewers cut the cord, internet advertising has ensured that video ads are more popular than ever.So what does it take to make a good ad? Well, as you’ll see in the examples below, there are a few common traits the best commercials share.They’re memorable: From “Wassup!” to “Where’s the Beef?” the most successful ads have a way of ingraining themselves in your memory (whether you want them to or not!) Today’s average urbanite sees some 5000 advertising messages in a single day. Your job, as an advertiser, is to cut through the noise and stand out with a message that’s relevant, different, and effectively represents your brand identity.They’re shareworthy: For maximum exposure, your ad should make people want to talk about it with other people, both in real life and on social media. Usually the ads that inspire that kind of dialogue have elicited some kind of emotional reaction: they’re funny, shocking, weird, or emotionally touching.They communicate the brand’s values: The best ads capture the brand’s voice and identity, and communicate the ethos behind the company. Your audience should watch the ad and think, “this brand is for people like me.”Call to action: Lastly, an effective commercial makes it clear what it wants you to do next, whether it’s to visit a website, lease a car, or buy some candy. While some advertisers skip this step, incorporating the brand more subtly or focusing on awareness, you can really only get away with this if you’re already a household name like Nike or Apple.Create your perfect video in minutesGet started for free.Make a video — it’s free!Funniest CommercialsLet’s get this out of the way: humor is hard. What’s hilarious to one person might be downright annoying to another. When it’s effective, a funny ad can grab attention and inspire positive feelings for a brand. But a joke that falls flat can do the opposite, or even inspire a negative backlash.Moreover, experts are split on whether even a hilarious, popular ad will actually translate to increased revenue and awareness. In some cases, a funny ad can cause a so-called “vampire effect” in which viewers remember the ad, but not the product or company it’s associated with.The key, it seems, is to strike just the right balance between being funny, relevant, and informative. Here are some of the most effective, and funniest commercials we’ve seen:Old Spice: “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” (2010)When Old Spice realized that women made the majority of purchasing decisions when it came to men’s body wash products, they took a different approach with their next campaign. While the tagline “don’t let your man smell like a woman,” might not fly these days, the genuinely funny non-sequitur dialogue and Isaiah Mustafa’s perfect delivery made it a massive hit.Old Spice’s ad was perhaps the pinnacle of the absurdist, unpredictable, meme-able humor many advertisers have embraced, in hopes of creating a viral hit. And it worked. The ad took home nearly every major industry award that year and currently stands at over 55 million views on YouTube. Old Spice, meanwhile, has continued to hone their off-beat brand voice with a hugely popular follow-up campaign starring actor Terry Crews.Reebok: “Terry Tate, Office Linebacker” (2003)Slapstick violence: since the earliest days of comedy it’s been a foolproof way to make ‘em laugh. Reebok’s Super Bowl XXXVII ad had plenty, along with an amusing premise (boosting office productivity), an element of surprise, and solid one-liners and delivery.The spot was roundly praised by critics and viewers alike that year, though whether it actually succeeded in boosting Reebok’s brand is questionable. According to one poll after it aired, just 55% of viewers recalled that the ad was affiliated with Reebok. Though Reebok considered it nonetheless a success, citing a 4-fold increase in online sales, it’s still a good reminder to consider whether misaligned subject matter may cause your ad to become a victim of the ​</h2><br />

influence a lot of people. Sometimes this movie stars promote illegal drugs which could make a lot of young
people follow their idol. Like the use of Marijuana for example, some people promote them but authorities in
many countries that its negative effect out weight the positive effect. So to say that Marijuana is good for the
health this remains an opinion.
