Be Strong. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Motivating friends to pursue their dreams is a noble and challenging task. It requires a combination of empathy, understanding, and persuasive skills. As a friend, you can help your friends realize their full potential and achieve their dreams by following these steps.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, try to understand their aspirations and the reasons for their lack of focus. Sometimes, friends lose their motivation due to personal or external factors such as stress, lack of support, or self-doubt. Once you have identified the root cause, it will be easier to address and overcome the challenges.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, encourage your friends to set specific goals and create a plan of action. Break down their dreams into smaller, achievable steps, and offer to help them create a realistic timeline. A plan of action provides direction and purpose, and it helps to measure progress.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, provide emotional support and be a source of encouragement. Friends need to believe in their abilities and have someone who cheers them on. Be positive and provide reassurance when they doubt themselves. Acknowledge their achievements, no matter how small, and celebrate their successes.</p><p></p><p>Fourthly, provide practical support. Sometimes, friends need a helping hand in achieving their dreams. Offer to assist them in researching scholarships or job opportunities, proofreading their application, or providing additional resources to aid their studies.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, lead by example. Show your friends that it is possible to achieve their dreams by pursuing your own goals. Share your successes and challenges, and offer advice based on your experiences.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, motivating friends to focus on their dreams requires a combination of empathy, understanding, and persuasive skills. By helping them to identify their aspirations, creating a plan of action, providing emotional and practical support, and leading by example, you can inspire them to achieve their goals. Remember, it takes time, patience, and effort, but with a little help, your friends can reach their full potential and live their dreams.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Pa brainly po</p><br />

                            11. List down at least 5 and how all these steps be a help in pursuing your goals and dreams in life.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Step 1:  Set Goals with the Greatest Positive Impact</p><p></p><p>We are often pulled in many directions, which makes it hard to accomplish even one small goal. To prioritize your goals, look at all areas of your life such as family, health, career, finances, and leisure activities. Then decide what goal(s) in each area truly motivate you and will most positively impact your life.</p><p></p><p>Goal expert Brian Tracy, in his book Flight Plan, talks about his guaranteed success formula for achieving goals. He says to write down ten goals and identify one goal on the list that would have the greatest positive impact on life, a goal that is “your major definite purpose, your primary goal, and your most important destination for the next leg of your life’s journey.” Next, Tracy recommends transferring that goal to a clean sheet of paper, and making a list of potential obstacles with solutions as well as additional information, skills and people needed in order to achieve that goal. Finally, he says, organize this information into a plan and start taking action.</p><p></p><p>Step 2: Make SMART Goals for Best Results</p><p></p><p>To make goals that are focused and achievable, they need to be S.M.A.R.T., an acronym that typically means:</p><p></p><p>Specific</p><p>Measurable</p><p>Achievable</p><p>Realistic</p><p>Time-limited</p><p>For example, instead of saying, “I want to start my own business,” a SMART goal would be: “I will start my own life coaching business that helps people with major life transitions by May 1, 2015.” The latter goal is specific in that there is no question as to what is trying to be accomplished. Also, anyone can determine whether or not it has been completed, which makes it measurable, and the time-limitation helps create the motivation.</p><p></p><p>Also part of the SMART criteria is to make sure that the goal is achievable and realistic. When we set ourselves up for potential failure, it can be disempowering and motivation can be lost. We do need to stretch ourselves when goal setting to maximize our potential, but the goal should not be so far out of reach that, more than likely, it is impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Step 3: Writing Goals Down Is Essential</p><p></p><p>In Henriette Anne Klauser’s book, Write it Down, Make it Happen: Knowing What You Want – And Getting It, she says that writing down your goals is the first step towards achieving them. She talks about Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip Dilbert, once a “lowly technology worker in Corporate America,” who spent 15 minutes a day writing down: “I will become a syndicated cartoonist.” After many rejections and through perseverance, she says, Scott became a syndicated cartoonist in over 2,000 newspapers worldwide and is now known all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Writing goals in a daily planner, a journal or even on sticky notes, helps focus our attention on them and makes them more real.</p><p></p><p>Step 4: Think of Potential Obstacles and Real Solutions</p><p></p><p>Winston Churchill said, “Success is going from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm.” Successful people fail more than unsuccessful people simply because they keep trying no matter what obstacles they come across.</p><p></p><p>Obstacles to achieving goals can include fear of failure, fear of success and lack of self-confidence. An obstacle can be less threatening if there are potential solutions. So think about some real solutions to help overcome roadblocks in the path to your success. Often the best solution is to simply re-connect with your driving force or compelling vision for achieving the goal.</p><p></p><p>Step 5: Focus on Goals Everyday</p><p></p><p>Focusing daily on our goals helps us succeed in reaching them because it’s a constant reminder of what we desire in life. Two ways to keep goals present in the mind are:</p><p></p><p>Think from the end – Dr. Wayne Dyer, internationally renowned author and speaker in the field of self-development, in his book The Power of Intention, says that to manifest what we desire, “continuously contemplate yourself as being surrounded by the conditions you wish to produce.” Imagine what life will look like once the goal is realized and the joy and satisfaction you will feel.</p><p>Visualize – Create a vision board with pictures, symbols and words relating to goals, or even a simple daily visualization practice where you imagine yourself having achieved the goal as mentioned above.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pursuing a dream requires setting specific goals and taking actionable steps towards achieving them. It also involves persistence, dedication, and hard work to overcome obstacles and challenges that may arise along the way.</p><p></p><p>Having a clear vision of what one wants to achieve and the benefits of accomplishing it can serve as a powerful motivator to keep going. Additionally, surrounding oneself with supportive and encouraging individuals can help fuel motivation and keep one accountable.</p><p></p><p>Courage is an essential ingredient for pursuing dreams because it often involves stepping outside of one's comfort zone, taking risks, and facing potential failure. Without courage, fear and doubt can hold individuals back from pursuing their goals and realizing their full potential. Ultimately, having the courage to pursue one's dreams can lead to personal growth, fulfillment, and a sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>THE Infinite Plan" is Isabel Allende's fifth novel and her first to be set in the United States, where she now lives. The Chilean-born journalist and author received considerable attention for her previous books, "The House of the Spirits," "Of Love and Shadows," "Eva Luna," and "The Stories of Eva Luna," which found their way onto the bestseller lists.</p><p>Allende writes with passion and conviction, but her work has yet to demonstrate the consistent level of originality and craftsmanship that distinguishes consummate artist from aspiring author.</p><p>Her new novel, as its title suggests, is ambitious in scope, but merely competent in execution: a large canvas, filled with characters, action, and historical scenery that gives the impression of having been painted boldly and rather hurriedly.</p>Recommended: Could you pass a US citizenship test?<p>Allende has wisely chosen an outstandingly atypical man to be the prototypically American hero of her story. The reader first meets Gregory Reeves as a little boy in the 1940s, traveling the country with his close-knit, eccentric family headed by his father, Charles Reeves, a self-styled artist and charismatic preacher who offers his audiences insights into the "divine plan."</p>TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE Could you pass a US citizenship test?PHOTOS OF THE DAY Photos of the day 02/08<p>Along with little Gregory and his older sister, Judy, this itinerant menage includes two women: Charles Reeves's wife, Nora, a Russian Jewish immigrant with a passion for opera and a commitment to the tolerant teachings of the Bahai faith, and Nora's friend - and boisterous opposite - Olga, who supplements the family income working as a fortuneteller.</p><p>When Charles falls ill, the family road-show grinds to a halt in the barrio of East Los Angeles. The blonde, blue-eyed Reeves children grow up in this environment, warmly accepted by some, taunted and ostracized by others. Gregory learns to avoid - and when necessary face down - trouble. He also makes a friend for life in a neighborhood girl named Carmen.</p><p>The novel follows Gregory, Carmen, and Gregory's sister, Judy, through their teens and into their 50s. The focus is primarily on Gregory, who also narrates alternate sections of the story, but Carmen receives a sizable share of the attention as well.</p><p>Gregory manages to make his way to college and law school, only to be catapulted into the Vietnam War and unsought heroism. Judy endures bad husbands who leave her with children she cherishes. Carmen survives the stigma of an unwanted pregnancy and the dangers of an illegal abortion to become a compassionate artist, mother, and woman.</p><p>Gregory flounders for decades, dreaming of social justice in the 1960s, trying to forget the horrors of war in his blind pursuit of money and power in the early 1980s, failing to understand himself until he is well into his 40s. His inner conflicts are believably portrayed, with the unspoken but implicit suggestion that this one man's difficulties and protracted growing pains reflect the vicissitudes of his times and places.</p><p>Allende treads a fine line between writing expressively and resorting to overblown cliches: "... he had made himself a man," she writes of Gregory, "silently enduring repeated bumps and knocks along the way, faithful to the national myth of the independent, proud, and free individual. He considered himself a good citizen willing to pay his taxes and defend his country, but somewhere he had fallen into an insidious trap, and instead of living the expected reward he was still slogging through a swamp."</p><p>Admirers of Allende's earlier work may be a little disappointed by her lack of finesse in this one, but will still find much to engage mind and heart alike.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Jose Rizal </strong>once said that "ang kabataan ang pag asa ng bayan" and "Without education and liberty, which are the soil and the sun of man, no reform is possible, no measure can give the result desired." he believe that education can help our country free from political and religious control. he believe that despite of the poor country we are the hope. </p><p>and For me i believe that education is important for us to peruse our dreams and goals in our life because it was a great feeling that you have a stable career before you build your family and having a educational degree is such a privilege not just as an individual but also for the family because of their sacrifices they make to help you grab the career you wanted. </p><p>my message from my fellow students who wants to pursue their dreams they have to work hard and look forward to the things that are right because regret will always in the end when they made a bad choice.</p><br />
