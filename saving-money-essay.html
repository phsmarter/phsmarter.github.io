Some people might argue that bicycles are impractical for carrying packages and other loads but by adding racks and baskets to bicycles, people would be amazed how much they can carry on these woderful two-wheeled vehicles. I strongly believe that more people in Phoenix should use bicycles to get from palce to place, . Second, increased use of bicycles would reduce our reliance on gasoline, preserving it for other purposes and allowing people to save the money that they'd otherwise spend on fuel. Finally, bicycling is extremely good exercise and would improve most people's strength and cardiovascular condition and help them lose weight as well. First bicycles are powered by the rider's muscles so they do not create air pollution​</a>

As online learning becomes more common and more and more resources are converted to digital form, some people have suggested that public libraries should be shut down and, in their place, everyone should be given e-materials.Proponents of this idea state that it will save local cities and towns money because libraries are expensive to maintain. They also believe it will encourage more people to read because they won’t have to travel to a library to get a book; they can simply click on what they want to read and read it from wherever they are. They could also access more materials because libraries won’t have to buy physical copies of books; they can simply rent out as many digital copies as they need.1.

Write 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th on the space provided.            _____ Some people think that automatic hand dryers don‘t dry their hands as thoroughly as paper towels. People stand in front of the hand dryers for just a few seconds, and they are disappointed that their hands do not feel dry. However, studies have shown that when people dry their hands for at least 30 seconds, automatic dryers actually dry much better than paper towels. It is difficult to get every part of your hand dry using paper towels. The blast of air makes sure that your hands are completely dry… if you take a few extra seconds. _____In addition, if the school buys automatic hand dryers, we can save money that can be spent on more important things. I have noticed that there is a terrible waste of paper towels in the restrooms. Students continuously pull on the lever, dispensing towels that they do not really need. It is annoying to find the dispenser empty. Our custodian is called several times a day to bring in bundles of replacements, just because some kids are wasteful. All of these paper towels cost a lot of money. An automatic hand dryer cost costs approximately $500, with very little additional cost over time. On the other hand, paper towels can cost $25 a case, or about $500 a year, since we use about 20 cases each year.After just one year, it would pay for itself. If we installed automatic hand dryers, we would not waste paper towels, and it would save the school a ton of money._____First of all, the automatic hand dryer is very sanitary. Instead of pulling on a lever that has been touched by a large number of students, users can just stick their hands under the air dryer. No germs can get on them because there is nothing to touch. Just think how the attendance rate would improve. Kids wouldn‘t get sick from the germ-infested paper towel dispensers we now use at our school. This would keep kids‘ hands germ-free. _____Keeping kids healthy, saving money, and helping our school stay clean are strong reasons for installing automatic hand dryers. Every day that goes by without having them means that we are continuing to have problems in our restrooms because we are using paper towels. Let‘s install automatic hand dryers as good as possible! Testing the Quality of My Reasons - Sample Issue and Point of View: Automatic motion-sensing hand dryers should be used in all school restrooms. Weak Reasons (probably won‘t convince my audience).* They are fun to use.* They warm your hands on cold days. * They dry your hands quicker than paper towels._____Finally, our bathroom is a paper towel mess! There are always piles of paper towels on the floor. Sometimes the extras fall from the dispenser unused. Many times kids bunch their used towels into a ball and aim for a basket. But if they miss the target, the paper ball stays on the floor. Sometimes the towels are even tossed to the ceiling like spitballs. Paper towels leave so much litter in the restrooms that the restrooms are a mess—even before the end of the day!_____Although some people don‘t like using hand dryers in restrooms, it may actually be argued that the motion-sensing hand dryers are a practical alternative to paper towels. More and more businesses are investing in automatic hand dryers keep the restrooms cleaner. I believe that our school would benefit from investing in automatic motion-sensing hand dryers in all the restrooms.​​</a>

Third, it allows people to save money in their fare or fuel especially nowadays that the fare for commuters increases. Fourth, it is a safe vehicle from home to your workplace or other places you may want to go and vice versa, because you don't need to be exposed in many commuters along the way and you can breathe freely, and feel the breeze while riding on the bicycle. Fifth, you can use it for recreational activities especially when you want to explore places you haven't been before. Sixth, it can improve your muscle strength and cardio-vascular condition. Finally, it can be a good exercise specifically when you want to lose weight. To some people, they might argue that bicycles are not the safest ride and are unserviceable specifically in carrying packages and other loads, but when you think of a good idea, like putting a basket, adding racks or panniers to the bicycle you can be amaze about the capability to carry the loads. People would also look wonderful riding the two-wheel vehicle feeling the breeze and it can help save our planet. Discussion Questions: 1. What is the persuasive essay all about? 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Importance of Saving Money : Money is something very much valuable and required for the survival. It’s not just one piece of paper but it holds some value, a value that has to be understood by every individual. If we quote it into a particular definition then money is, “A measure of value, medium of exchange and means of payment consisting of notes,coins and paperless payment systems like smart cards.” It is not about some class of people but about everyone, be it the lower class or the richie rich. Money holds so much that we even fail to anticipate. It holds power, ability to create jealousy, manipulation, greed and what not.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            19. Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs in the correct order to arrive at a persuasive essay. Write 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th on the space provided.            _____ Some people think that automatic hand dryers don‘t dry their hands as thoroughly as paper towels. People stand in front of the hand dryers for just a few seconds, and they are disappointed that their hands do not feel dry. However, studies have shown that when people dry their hands for at least 30 seconds, automatic dryers actually dry much better than paper towels. It is difficult to get every part of your hand dry using paper towels. The blast of air makes sure that your hands are completely dry… if you take a few extra seconds. _____In addition, if the school buys automatic hand dryers, we can save money that can be spent on more important things. I have noticed that there is a terrible waste of paper towels in the restrooms. Students continuously pull on the lever, dispensing towels that they do not really need. It is annoying to find the dispenser empty. Our custodian is called several times a day to bring in bundles of replacements, just because some kids are wasteful. All of these paper towels cost a lot of money. An automatic hand dryer cost costs approximately $500, with very little additional cost over time. On the other hand, paper towels can cost $25 a case, or about $500 a year, since we use about 20 cases each year.After just one year, it would pay for itself. If we installed automatic hand dryers, we would not waste paper towels, and it would save the school a ton of money._____First of all, the automatic hand dryer is very sanitary. Instead of pulling on a lever that has been touched by a large number of students, users can just stick their hands under the air dryer. No germs can get on them because there is nothing to touch. Just think how the attendance rate would improve. Kids wouldn‘t get sick from the germ-infested paper towel dispensers we now use at our school. This would keep kids‘ hands germ-free. _____Keeping kids healthy, saving money, and helping our school stay clean are strong reasons for installing automatic hand dryers. Every day that goes by without having them means that we are continuing to have problems in our restrooms because we are using paper towels. Let‘s install automatic hand dryers as good as possible! Testing the Quality of My Reasons - Sample Issue and Point of View: Automatic motion-sensing hand dryers should be used in all school restrooms. Weak Reasons (probably won‘t convince my audience).* They are fun to use.* They warm your hands on cold days. * They dry your hands quicker than paper towels._____Finally, our bathroom is a paper towel mess! There are always piles of paper towels on the floor. Sometimes the extras fall from the dispenser unused. Many times kids bunch their used towels into a ball and aim for a basket. But if they miss the target, the paper ball stays on the floor. Sometimes the towels are even tossed to the ceiling like spitballs. Paper towels leave so much litter in the restrooms that the restrooms are a mess—even before the end of the day!_____Although some people don‘t like using hand dryers in restrooms, it may actually be argued that the motion-sensing hand dryers are a practical alternative to paper towels. More and more businesses are investing in automatic hand dryers keep the restrooms cleaner. I believe that our school would benefit from investing in automatic motion-sensing hand dryers in all the restrooms.​​</h2><br />

For example, you can look at the gender variable, where the grouping is generally only into two, namely male  and female which are coded 1 and 2.</p><p> The number only serves as a category label, without having a numeric value like a true number.  These numbers do not have the same properties as numbers in general, so that on variables with a nominal scale, mathematical operations such as subtraction, addition, multiplication, etc. cannot be applied.</p><p> 2. <strong>Ordinal scale</strong></p><p> The ordinal scale is one type of measurement scale where the number symbols of the measurement results are in the form of a sequence or level.  Appropriate statistical tests are mode, median, frequency distribution and non-parametric statistics such as rank order correlation.</p><p> 3. <strong>Interval Scale</strong></p><p> Is a type of measurement scale that has characteristics similar to the ordinal scale, which has a certain order.  Another characteristic inherent in the interval scale is the existence of a scale unit.  Appropriate statistical tests are all statistical tests except those that are based on ratios such as the coefficient of variation.</p><p> 4. <strong>Ratio scale</strong></p><p> Ratio scale is a type of measurement scale that produces data of the highest quality.  The difference between the ratio scale and the interval scale lies in the presence of a zero value (based value).  On a ratio scale, zero is absolute, unlike on an interval scale.  The data generated by the ratio scale is ratio data.  There are no restrictions on the appropriate statistical test tools.</p><p></p><p> Learn information regarding level of measurements at https://brainly.ph/question/14034954.</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
