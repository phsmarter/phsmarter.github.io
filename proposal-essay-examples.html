Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

idea regarding the reason for his writing the Noli, “I shall do with you what was done in ages past with the
sick, who were exposed on the steps of the temple so that the worshippers, having invoked the God,
should each propose a remedy”. The task that Rizal saw clearly was the need to expose the cancers in
society. The cure or remedy will come from the Filipinos themselves. Comment on this in a short essay.
Give an example from the Noli to show how Rizal achieved his goal in writing the novel.</a>

Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                            12. Part C – Write foreign policy proposal.
Write your report to the government of Karmin in the form of a three-paragraph essay. Use this rubric to guide your response. Be sure to answer the following questions:
1. What do you think your country's foreign policy goals should be? Do you want to gain power and influence overseas or simply protect your sovereignty? Explain why you think these goals are appropriate, using historical examples.
2. Should the country align itself with NATO, the Warsaw Pact, or the Unaligned Movement? Explain your answer, using historical examples.
3. However the country chooses to align itself, what type of foreign policy should it have toward the rest of the world? Should it be more aggressive or more diplomatic? Explain your answer, using historical examples.
pls answer asap</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>As a country, Karmin's foreign policy goals should primarily focus on protecting its sovereignty and security while also promoting economic growth and stability. This can be achieved through a combination of diplomatic and military means, as well as through economic and trade agreements. Historically, countries that have prioritized their own security and economic prosperity have been able to maintain stability and prosperity for their citizens.In terms of alliances, Karmin should align itself with the Unaligned Movement. This will allow the country to maintain its independence and autonomy in decision-making while also allowing it to form partnerships and alliances on a case-by-case basis. Historically, non-aligned countries have been able to navigate the complexities of international relations more effectively as they are not bound by the constraints of a specific alliance.In terms of foreign policy towards the rest of the world, Karmin should adopt a balanced approach that combines elements of both diplomacy and assertiveness. This approach will enable the country to engage with other nations on a wide range of issues, from trade and economic cooperation to security and defense. However, it is important for the country to be prepared to defend its interests when necessary. This type of foreign policy has been shown to be effective in the past, as demonstrated by countries that have been able to maintain good relations with other nations while also effectively defending their own interests.<p></p><br />

                            22. points) In Rizal’s own introduction printed at the start of the Noli Me Tangere, Rizal gives a clear
idea regarding the reason for his writing the Noli, “I shall do with you what was done in ages past with the
sick, who were exposed on the steps of the temple so that the worshippers, having invoked the God,
should each propose a remedy”. The task that Rizal saw clearly was the need to expose the cancers in
society. The cure or remedy will come from the Filipinos themselves. Comment on this in a short essay.
Give an example from the Noli to show how Rizal achieved his goal in writing the novel.</h2><br />
