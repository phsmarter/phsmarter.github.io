Talking will be a big help in easing out your anger.​​</a>

                            2. essay about amendment on the K-12 curriculum ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:The K-12 curriculum refers to the educational program for primary and secondary education in the United States. In recent years, there have been discussions and debates about the need to amend the K-12 curriculum to better prepare students for the challenges of the modern world. While the current curriculum covers a wide range of subjects, some argue that it needs to be updated to reflect the changing needs of society.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One proposed amendment to the K-12 curriculum is to increase the emphasis on STEM subjects, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This is because there is a growing demand for workers in STEM fields, and it is important that students are prepared for these careers. Additionally, STEM education can foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, which are essential skills for success in any field.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another amendment to the K-12 curriculum is to integrate more real-world experiences and practical skills. This can include courses in financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and vocational education. These skills are important for students who may not pursue traditional academic paths and can provide them with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the workforce.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Furthermore, there is a growing movement to incorporate social and emotional learning (SEL) into the K-12 curriculum. SEL can help students develop self-awareness, social awareness, and responsible decision-making skills. This can help students become more resilient and better equipped to deal with challenges they may face in their personal and professional lives.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Lastly, the K-12 curriculum could also be amended to include a greater focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can include courses on multiculturalism, gender and sexuality, and racial justice. By promoting inclusivity and cultural understanding, students can develop a deeper appreciation for different perspectives and learn how to work effectively in diverse environments.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Overall, amending the K-12 curriculum can provide students with a more relevant and comprehensive education that prepares them for success in the 21st century. By incorporating STEM education, practical skills, social and emotional learning, and diversity and inclusion, students can develop the skills, knowledge, and values needed to succeed in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: Paraphrase niyo nalang</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>The Importance of K-12</strong></p><p></p><p>The cornerstone of a student's academic career is their K–12 education. It offers the fundamental information and abilities required for success in both the classroom and the business world. K–12 education is crucial for creating moral adults and preparing children for adult responsibilities. The K–12 curriculum focused solely on students who weren't yet prepared for the workforce. This program will pave the way for a generation of graduates who are daily prepared for future sustainable growth by providing participants with theoretical knowledge and useful skills. The program seeks to increase the language, mathematical, and scientific proficiency of Filipino students. DepEd is committed to providing a higher-quality education through tracks with the new curriculum. Students will have adequate time on each track to become experts in a subject and develop their talents.</p><p></p><br />

                            6. What is your opinion about K-12? make an essay about your opinion.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>K-12 education refers to the standard education system in the United States, which spans from kindergarten to twelfth grade. The K-12 curriculum includes a wide range of subject areas, including math, science, English, social studies, and physical education. The primary objective of K-12 education is to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in college, career, and life. </p><p></p><p>One of the key benefits of the K-12 education system is that it provides students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for the challenges and opportunities in life. By exposing students to a broad range of subject areas, K-12 education enables them to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical abilities that are essential for success in today's increasingly complex world. Additionally, K-12 education provides students with opportunities to develop social and emotional skills, such as collaboration, communication, and empathy. These skills are highly valued by employers and are essential for success in all areas of life.</p><p></p><p>However, K-12 education also faces a number of challenges in terms of ensuring equity and access for all students. There are significant disparities in educational outcomes among students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, which can limit the opportunities and life outcomes for students who come from disadvantaged communities. Additionally, there is a significant achievement gap between students of color and white students, which can contribute to systemic injustices and inequality in society.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, K-12 education plays a crucial role in preparing students for success in college, career, and life. While it has its strengths, there are also challenges that must be addressed to ensure that all students have access to high-quality education that prepares them for success in the future. Ultimately, K-12 education must continue to adapt to the changing needs and demands of society, to ensure that students are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and competencies that are necessary for success in the twenty-first century.</p><p></p><br />

                            8. argumentative essay about terminating of the k-12 program​</h2><br />
                        <p>The implementation of the K-12 program in the Philippines has been a controversial topic since it was first introduced in 2011. While some people argue that it is necessary for the country's educational system to compete globally, others believe that it should be terminated due to several issues.</p><p></p><p>One of the main arguments against the K-12 program is the financial burden it places on families. The program requires additional two years of education, which means more expenses for parents who already struggle to pay for their children's basic needs. Some families may have to sacrifice other important expenses such as food and healthcare just to keep their children in school.</p><p></p><p>Another issue with the K-12 program is the lack of facilities and teachers to accommodate the increased number of students. This has led to overcrowded classrooms, inadequate teaching materials, and a shortage of qualified teachers. As a result, students are not getting the quality education they deserve, and the program is failing to achieve its goals.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the K-12 program has been criticized for its inability to address the country's job market needs. Despite the additional two years of education, many students still struggle to find employment opportunities after graduation. This is because the program has not focused on developing the necessary skills and knowledge that are relevant to the country's job market.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the K-12 program has not lived up to its promises of providing quality education and better job opportunities. Instead, it has placed a financial burden on families, failed to provide adequate facilities and teachers, and failed to address the country's job market needs. Therefore, it is time to consider terminating the program and finding alternative solutions that will truly benefit the students and the country as a whole.</p><br />

Because some of them are still thinking about their courses and still not ready for College, many students also disagree, if K-12 wil be abolished because some of the students are already in Gr11 - 12 and it would be really unfair for them if the K-12 will be abolished. Furthermore, many of the Parents wants to agree to abolished the K-12 because of thr lack of money, Poverty, and they think its a waste of money. That's why some of the parents agree and some of them disagree, aswell in the students. That's why for me its a BIG NO because I'm struggling to find a good course and still not yet ready to go in College. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> I hope this will help you with your essay, it just seems like a little bit wrong because i didn't google.

Talking will be a big help in easing out your anger.​​</h2><br />
