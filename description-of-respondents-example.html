                        <p>I have accepted the fact that people who suffer from anxiety and depression will never be cured. Therapy is always there but I've never really seen it as an option probably because I live in the Philippines. However, I meet more and more people who have chosen to get help and so far, there are mixed opinions. The Philippines already has the Mental Health Act approved by the two houses of the senate which hopefully will be passed into law this year (2018). It's a clear indication that the country is moving towards making people aware of mental health and helping those who are in constant battle with mental health problems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            10. Directions: Write T if the statement is correct and F if it is not.F 21. To exemplify is to convince someone that your opinion on a subject is the right one.T T 22. Division and classification pattern make it easy for individuals to locate what they are looking for, butthese organizational methods are also useful for understanding complex problems and/or issues.T 23. A paragraph that demonstrates comparison and/or contrast examines how given subjects are eithersimilar or different.24. Paragraphs can be developed using a variety of patterns that reflect your thinking about the material.T 25. Declamation is like telling a story.26. Subjective description is when the writer has to stay away from emotional impressions or responses,bracketing his/her biases and the goal is to present an impartial and actual picture of an object orscene.F27. It is vital that as you write, you have a clear sense of your readers- what they might already know, howfamiliar they are with the topic.28. Folk tales contain a "story" component-characters, setting, conflict, climax and resolution. It is notsimply listing the events, it is pointing in the direction of a story using specific details.29. As you write persuasively, think of your audience and the kind of evidence your audience wouldlikely to respond to, so that your paragraph will become more convincing.30. Using transitional words and phrases that signal examples are recommended.31. Considering the type of audience and the kind of evidences your audience would likely respond to arehelpful32. When you use the division strategy, you are discussing a single item and breaking it down into itscomponents33. Objective description is when the writer is describing an impression of what is observed34. Comparison examines how the subjects are the same while contrast examines how the subjects aredifferent35. a reflection (or essay), the writers goal is to help the reader understand new terms orconcents, or to come to new understanding of terms they may be familiar with.​</h2><br />
