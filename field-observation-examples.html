Interviews were conducted with 40 patients, and 75 hours of field observations were conducted. The basic psychological process identified by the researchers was labeled “optimizing personal control to facilitate emotional comfort.” Personal control referred to the ability of patients to influence their environment; emotional comfort was defined as a state of relaxation that affected the physical status of the patient. Personal control was found to be a central feature of emotional comfort. Select one: a. Action Research b. Phenomenological Research c. Narrative Research d. Grounded Theory Research e.

bacteria and fungi and the groups that are compared are males and females. Oftentimes,
comparative research questions are useful when designing experiments. Counting the number of
microbes present in the soil is a somewhat interesting observation, but comparing the number of
microbes in a field with a high number of shrubs to one that has a low number of shrubs is more
interesting and useful.
With this in mind, its time to decide on your experimental question. Begin by thinking of a
comparison to make, then turn that into a question. The focus on your experiment should revolve
around microbial growth in some sort of medium you have at home: maybe inhibiting growth using
some additive or comparing the amount of growth in different conditions or different inoculating
sources for growth, etc.
Give a comparative question on microbes And what is the hypothesis? </a>

• Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline. This is important since an entire system or operation and all the stakeholders of an  institution or organization are at stake. Without scientific basis, someone may be affected or may suffer. For example, in the field of medicine, a new drug must first be tested to determine its efficacy in curing sickness before it can actually be prescribed.
• Research is undertaken for the continuous development and further productivity in any field. Any system that will be utilized in any organization must first be tried to determine its value and it must be better than the previous system used. Simply, research is the result am of advancing knowledge from the past.
• Research helps develop tools for assessing effectiveness of any practice and operation such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, psychological assessments, among others.
This importance of research is observed in behavioral science and physical science, among others.

                            23. Remember from the beginning of the semester- Comparative questions ask how some variable
differs among a set of groups. For example, "Do male hands have more bacteria and fungi on them.
than female hands?" is a comparative research question. The variable measured is amount of
bacteria and fungi and the groups that are compared are males and females. Oftentimes,
comparative research questions are useful when designing experiments. Counting the number of
microbes present in the soil is a somewhat interesting observation, but comparing the number of
microbes in a field with a high number of shrubs to one that has a low number of shrubs is more
interesting and useful.
With this in mind, its time to decide on your experimental question. Begin by thinking of a
comparison to make, then turn that into a question. The focus on your experiment should revolve
around microbial growth in some sort of medium you have at home: maybe inhibiting growth using
some additive or comparing the amount of growth in different conditions or different inoculating
sources for growth, etc.
Give a comparative question on microbes And what is the hypothesis? </h2><br />

                            25. Explain the ff:
• Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline. This is important since an entire system or operation and all the stakeholders of an  institution or organization are at stake. Without scientific basis, someone may be affected or may suffer. For example, in the field of medicine, a new drug must first be tested to determine its efficacy in curing sickness before it can actually be prescribed.
• Research is undertaken for the continuous development and further productivity in any field. Any system that will be utilized in any organization must first be tried to determine its value and it must be better than the previous system used. Simply, research is the result am of advancing knowledge from the past.
• Research helps develop tools for assessing effectiveness of any practice and operation such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, psychological assessments, among others.
This importance of research is observed in behavioral science and physical science, among others.

                        <p>Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline by providing evidence-based data that can be used to inform decisions and guide practices. Through research, we can develop tools to assess the effectiveness of any practice or operation, such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, and psychological assessments. Research also helps us to advance knowledge from the past and to continuously develop further productivity in any field. By having a scientific basis for any practice or methodology, we can ensure that no one is adversely affected or suffers as a result of any decisions or practices.</p><br />
