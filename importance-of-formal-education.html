                                            ACTIVITY 1 Directions: Read the passage below and choose one Technique in Summarizing various Academic Text. Essay 1: Importance of Education smmibe Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training. It can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum. In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training. Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards.​</a>

However, teachers perceive several reasons for the limited useof fieldwork in schools. Further, outdoor education is often organised asa single fieldtrip guided by outdoor educators, and little research hasbeen done on fieldwork as a regular part of formal biology education.This case study explores three secondary-school biology teachers whountypically use outdoor education as a major part of their ecologycourses for 8th grade students (median age 14). Berger and Luckmann'stheory of the process of institutionalization as a theoretical backgroundis used to interpret the pedagogical and organizational choices of thecase study teachers. Analysis of the interviews of the selected threeteachers revealed pedagogical and organizational means throughwhich outdoor teaching is institutionalized into a regular activity inbiology lessons. The teachers considered regularity, assessment practicesand the school curriculum as major tools to legitimate outdoor learningas a formal schoolwork and foster successful learning. However, they alsoemphasised students' freedom during outdoor activities. The findings arediscussed in terms of how the teachers succeeded in combining theinstitutional order of formal schooling with students' freedom in nature.​</a>

Essay on Education By: Priyanka Nagrale Countless words are written daily about the importance of education. Indubitably, education is the only valuable asset humans can achieve. Human evolution over eons is a result of education both formal and informal. Further, education is the sole basis on which the future of the human race depends.

I hope that you now pay attention to the basic elements of a position paper. Prepare to examine one in the next activities. Good Luck! Everyone speaks about education and its importance. Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</a>

However, teachers perceive several reasons for the limited useof fieldwork in schools. Further, outdoor education is often organised asa single fieldtrip guided by outdoor educators, and little research hasbeen done on fieldwork as a regular part of formal biology education.This case study explores three secondary-school biology teachers whountypically use outdoor education as a major part of their ecologycourses for 8th grade students (median age 14). Berger and Luckmann'stheory of the process of institutionalization as a theoretical backgroundis used to interpret the pedagogical and organizational choices of thecase study teachers. Analysis of the interviews of the selected threeteachers revealed pedagogical and organizational means throughwhich outdoor teaching is institutionalized into a regular activity inbiology lessons. The teachers considered regularity, assessment practicesand the school curriculum as major tools to legitimate outdoor learningas a formal schoolwork and foster successful learning. However, they alsoemphasised students' freedom during outdoor activities. The findings arediscussed in terms of how the teachers succeeded in combining theinstitutional order of formal schooling with students' freedom in nature.​</h2><br />

Human evolution over eons is a result of education both formal and informal. Further, education is the sole basis on which the future of the human race depends.

I hope that you now pay attention to the basic elements of a position paper. Prepare to examine one in the next activities. Good Luck! Everyone speaks about education and its importance. Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</h2><br />
