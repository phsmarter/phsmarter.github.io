Write your answer before the number. Not following instructions and putting an all-true or all-false answer will get no marks in this activity.1. Hazard is an undesirable catastrophe resulting from the forces that are largely beyond human control. 2. Hypocenter is the location on the surface of the Earth directly above where the earthquake starts. Epicenter is the location in the Earth where the earthquake originates. 3. Landslide is the other term for mass wasting. 4. Magnitude measures the energy released by an earthquake while intensity measures the strength of shaking it produces. 5. Surface waves travel through the interior of the Earth. On the other hand, body waves propagate only at the surface of the Earth. 6. The Richter scale is used to rate the intensity of an earthquake while Mercalli Scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake by observing its effect on people and properties. 7. Hazard maps serve as an adaptation planning tool that can support responsible, forward-looking decisions related to any possible disaster threats. 8. Tsunami is an Indonesian term basically caused by undersea earthquakes, landslides on the sea floor, volcanic eruptions and even asteroid impacts. On the other hand, lahar is a Japanese word for mudflows or mixtures of volcanic ash, blocks and water, formed on volcanoes. 9. The higher the lava's silica content, the lower its viscosity. 10. Sandboils are cavities in the ground that form when water erodes an underlying rock layer. 11. Primary waves (P-waves) travel faster, move in a push-pull pattern, travel through solids, liquids and gases, and cause less damage due to their smaller size. Secondary waves (S-waves) travel slower, move in an up-and-down pattern, travel only through solids, and cause more damage due to their greater size. 12. A seismograph is a record written by a seismogram in response to ground motions produced by an earthquake, explosion, or other ground-motion sources. 13. Philippines is just one of the 15 countries situated along the Pacific Spring of Fire. 14. Foreshocks are the energy release and ground shaking after an earthquake. 15. The most abundant volcanic gas is carbon dioxide, which is harmless. ​</a>

Large masses of clouds that spiral around a central point, or eye, characterize typhoons. Infamous for their destructive powers, typhoons can generate winds of more than 75 miles per hour and cause major flooding through their intense rainfall and storm surges. Their effects range from structural damage to trees, watercraft, and buildings to both immediate and long-term impacts on human life and livelihood.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Write your answer before the number. Not following instructions and putting an all-true or all-false answer will get no marks in this activity.1. Hazard is an undesirable catastrophe resulting from the forces that are largely beyond human control. 2. Hypocenter is the location on the surface of the Earth directly above where the earthquake starts. Epicenter is the location in the Earth where the earthquake originates. 3. Landslide is the other term for mass wasting. 4. Magnitude measures the energy released by an earthquake while intensity measures the strength of shaking it produces. 5. Surface waves travel through the interior of the Earth. On the other hand, body waves propagate only at the surface of the Earth. 6. The Richter scale is used to rate the intensity of an earthquake while Mercalli Scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake by observing its effect on people and properties. 7. Hazard maps serve as an adaptation planning tool that can support responsible, forward-looking decisions related to any possible disaster threats. 8. Tsunami is an Indonesian term basically caused by undersea earthquakes, landslides on the sea floor, volcanic eruptions and even asteroid impacts. On the other hand, lahar is a Japanese word for mudflows or mixtures of volcanic ash, blocks and water, formed on volcanoes. 9. The higher the lava's silica content, the lower its viscosity. 10. Sandboils are cavities in the ground that form when water erodes an underlying rock layer. 11. Primary waves (P-waves) travel faster, move in a push-pull pattern, travel through solids, liquids and gases, and cause less damage due to their smaller size. Secondary waves (S-waves) travel slower, move in an up-and-down pattern, travel only through solids, and cause more damage due to their greater size. 12. A seismograph is a record written by a seismogram in response to ground motions produced by an earthquake, explosion, or other ground-motion sources. 13. Philippines is just one of the 15 countries situated along the Pacific Spring of Fire. 14. Foreshocks are the energy release and ground shaking after an earthquake. 15. The most abundant volcanic gas is carbon dioxide, which is harmless. ​</h2><br />

Large masses of clouds that spiral around a central point, or eye, characterize typhoons. Infamous for their destructive powers, typhoons can generate winds of more than 75 miles per hour and cause major flooding through their intense rainfall and storm surges. Their effects range from structural damage to trees, watercraft, and buildings to both immediate and long-term impacts on human life and livelihood.</p><p></p><p>#CaRrY oN LeArNiNg</p><br />
