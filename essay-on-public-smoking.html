Then, write the hook and the thesis statement on the boxes below._____ According to recent reports, cigarette smoking in youth is getting serious. Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2011 (GYTS), a school-based national survey, showed that 13.7 percent of students are currently using tobacco. Although 92 percent of the surveyed schools already included tobacco control in their curriculum, it was not a priority in schools, division offices, and local government units. Thus, the Department of Education (DepEd) called for the effective implementation of a cohesive and comprehensive tobacco control program in schools through a new policy, DepEd Order No. 48, s. 2016._____ However, despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Ultimately, students should be intensively educated on the harms of tobacco use and health hazards of smoking including giving corrective actions to offenders. This is not only to save them from the “slow death” but to secure the nation’s public and economic health in the future.____ Therefore, DepEd Order No. 48 is a very vital policy, which should be followed and applied to all schools and DepEd offices to completely trash the ash and for everyone to savor a breath of fresh air.____ No surprise, cigarette smoking can literally “take your breath away.” It’s no secret that tobacco has finally been linked to being a bad drug which wreaks havoc on your body. Its avoidance is a general goal but for many years now, the issue on cigarette smoking particularly in schools still hasn’t declined. That’s why we should advocate in educating the youth on the adverse effects of tobacco and make it clear that just starting to smoke can end up giving them lifetime problems.Hook: _____________Thesis Statement: ____________​</a>

                                            DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

When it comes to smoking in public, one must ponder, who is more deserving of the right? Is it the citizen who is for smoking in public or is for the citizen who is against it?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Smoking in Public Spaces</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>argumentative essay about smoking is allowed in public spaces</p><p></p><p>Smoking is a highly controversial topic, and whether it should be allowed in public spaces is a question that has been debated for many years. While some argue that smoking is a personal choice and should be allowed in public spaces, others believe that it should be banned due to its negative impact on public health. In this essay, I will argue that smoking should not be allowed in public spaces.</p><p></p><p>The first reason why smoking should be banned in public spaces is because of the negative impact it has on public health. Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health problems. Secondhand smoke, which is the smoke that non-smokers inhale from smokers, can also cause serious health problems, especially for children and people with respiratory problems. Therefore, allowing smoking in public spaces puts everyone at risk, not just smokers.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why smoking should be banned in public spaces is that it can be a nuisance to others. Smoking produces a strong odor that can be unpleasant for non-smokers, and it can also cause discomfort and irritation to those with allergies or asthma. Additionally, cigarette smoke can stain clothes, furniture, and walls, leading to a loss of property value.</p><p></p><p>Finally, allowing smoking in public spaces can send the wrong message to young people. By allowing smoking in public spaces, we are normalizing a behavior that is harmful to one's health. This can lead young people to believe that smoking is a socially acceptable behavior, and increase the likelihood that they will start smoking themselves.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in public spaces due to its negative impact on public health, the nuisance it can cause to others, and the message it sends to young people. It is important to protect the health and well-being of everyone in our communities, and banning smoking in public spaces is one way to achieve this goal.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Even though people are aware of how unhealthy smoking can be, and what it can cause to their hearts and lungs, they still prefer to smoke. Today, smoking is a trend like a social media, and particularly among the teens. Although smoking makes an individual feel relaxed, at the same time it harms the body of the smokers in the long run. People have known that smoking can kill them from past 50-60 years, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are an estimated 1.3 billion smokers worldwide. This figure is anticipated to increase to 1.7 billion by 2020 (“Smoking”). People believe that banning smoking will make smokers violent and may damage the economy. Nevertheless, smoking should be cast out for several reasons, it damages the health of a person and their family member’s, victimize teenagers, humanity suffers, and endangers the life of non-smokers from second-hand smoke.</p><p></p><br />

Then, write the hook and the thesis statement on the boxes below._____ According to recent reports, cigarette smoking in youth is getting serious. Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2011 (GYTS), a school-based national survey, showed that 13.7 percent of students are currently using tobacco. Although 92 percent of the surveyed schools already included tobacco control in their curriculum, it was not a priority in schools, division offices, and local government units. Thus, the Department of Education (DepEd) called for the effective implementation of a cohesive and comprehensive tobacco control program in schools through a new policy, DepEd Order No. 48, s. 2016._____ However, despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Ultimately, students should be intensively educated on the harms of tobacco use and health hazards of smoking including giving corrective actions to offenders. This is not only to save them from the “slow death” but to secure the nation’s public and economic health in the future.____ Therefore, DepEd Order No. 48 is a very vital policy, which should be followed and applied to all schools and DepEd offices to completely trash the ash and for everyone to savor a breath of fresh air.____ No surprise, cigarette smoking can literally “take your breath away.” It’s no secret that tobacco has finally been linked to being a bad drug which wreaks havoc on your body. Its avoidance is a general goal but for many years now, the issue on cigarette smoking particularly in schools still hasn’t declined. That’s why we should advocate in educating the youth on the adverse effects of tobacco and make it clear that just starting to smoke can end up giving them lifetime problems.Hook: _____________Thesis Statement: ____________​</h2><br />

                            12. DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects.

Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe.

To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.

What is the position paper about? 2. What are the evidences /reasons of the writer? 3. If your were the writer, what will be your stand? Explain your answer.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The position paper is about whether anti-smoking ad campaigns really help or not. </p><p>2. The writer's evidences/reasons are that according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers has dropped significantly in recent years, their ads can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff, and they can help parents realize how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. </p><p>3. If I were the writer, my stand would be that anti-smoking ad campaigns are effective because they are able to motivate people to quit smoking and help parents realize the dangers of passive smoking for their kids. The evidence provided by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention also suggests that the number of smokers has declined significantly in the past decade, suggesting that the campaigns are having a positive impact.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
