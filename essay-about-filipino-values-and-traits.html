                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture and traditions of the Filipino people are deeply rooted in their history and shaped by their interactions with various foreign influences. The Philippines is a country with a rich cultural heritage, and the values that underpin Filipino culture reflect the resilience and adaptability of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p>One of the defining characteristics of Filipino culture is the emphasis on family and community. The Filipino people place great importance on the bond between family members and the sense of belonging that comes from being part of a tight-knit community. This value is reflected in the traditional concept of “bayanihan,” which emphasizes the importance of working together for the greater good of the community.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos are also known for their strong sense of hospitality and warmth towards guests. This value is reflected in the traditional practice of “pakikipagkapwa,” which means treating others with kindness and respect. Filipinos are known to go out of their way to make visitors feel welcome in their homes and communities, and this trait is a key part of their culture.</p><p></p><p>Respect for elders and the elderly is another important value in Filipino culture. The elderly are often considered the repository of wisdom and knowledge, and are accorded high regard in Filipino society. This is reflected in the traditional practice of “pagpapakonsiderado” which means to consider the feelings and needs of others.</p><p></p><p>Religion also plays a significant role in Filipino culture. Roman Catholic Christianity is the dominant religion in the Philippines, but many indigenous communities have retained their traditional spiritual practices. The values of respect and devotion to God, family and country are imbued in the Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these values, Filipino culture is also known for its rich artistic traditions. The Philippines has a long history of folk music, dance and visual arts. These traditions are often deeply connected to the natural environment and reflect the spiritual beliefs of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the culture and traditions of the Filipino people are shaped by their history and interactions with various foreign influences. The values that underpin Filipino culture reflect the resilience and adaptability of the Filipino people, and are deeply ingrained in their daily lives. These values, traditions and culture make the Filipino people who they are today, and will continue to shape their future.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Filipino food is a mixture of sweet, salty, and sour flavours. Rice figures heavily — this is Southeast Asia, after all! — and coconut is of utmost importance, with all parts of the coconut (including the sap and leaves) used in cooking and preparation. </p><p>2. Traditional games are seen as the best platform for "promoting peace, harmony, goodwill and camaraderie" in various Philippine communities especially that today's generation is different, most kids are stuck on their phones, iPods, and PSPs while sitting on a corner. </p><p>3. The Filipino culture is an exuberant story that tells of the nation's journey through the centuries. Customs reflect the people's faith, their oneness with others, their affinity with nature, and their celebration of life.</p><p></p><p>The Filipino's charm lies in their smiles, in the numerous religious festivals that venerate nature, the Divine and the cycles of life and in the virtue of pakikipag-kapwa tao that treasures relationships, with friends and strangers alike. The concept of kapwa(others) is at the core of the Filipino soul. A Filipino scholar says of the Filipino: the joy of his being is in being with others.</p><p></p><p>The nation's charm is in the diversity in ways of life across the archipelago, the resplendent colors of its folk arts and the cacophony of foreign influences that have found roots in the Filipino languages, customs and traditions. </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>ḍ̴͙̲͕̓͆͂̅͠͝</p><p>̶̛̣̤̰̋̋͌̑̾͗͂͛͛̆̇̈̿̔̎͘̚͠ ̴̡̢̧̘̪̖̪̼͙̹̩̜͎̬͕̜̜͈̣̩͎̃̈́̌̇̈́̊̿̌̆̍͋̓̀̌̊̎̀̀̈͘͜͝</p><p>̵̛̫̞̥͉͉̱̰͈͑͋̀̓͐̆͆̆̂̾̑͒̽̇̃̒̚͘͝ ̵̡̨̢̝̠͓̗̠̯̼̲̩͎͍̺̖̘͍̲̮̖̈́̈́͊͜͝ ̶̡̧̛̮͇̞͈̖̜̫͈̼̬̼̥̩́͛̈́̃̐̈́́̀̓̍̏͊̅̆̏͊͗̊̒̚͘ ̴̢̡̡̦̘̥̣͕͔̰̦͈͉͉̥̼͈͎̻͔̗́̏̾̒̀́̽͂̉͋͗͒̀̆͐͊̈́̚͜͝͝ͅ</p><p≯̛̛̦̠̗͇͈̟̘̔̐͐̅̓̒͊̆̈̓͆̂̚̕͘͜ ̶̡̧̛̦̣̞̤̫͖͓̥̭͉̯̱̺̖͖̘͉̝̤̺͑͌̐̽͌̓͌̏̋̓͆͆̊́̉̇̆̈́̓̀̚̕͠</p><p≯̺͙͇̦̯̱͈̼̝̼̯̙̝͖̭̞͋̀̉͛͊̑̓̃͝ͅ ̵̢͇͎͉̦̗̠̰͖͙͎̰̾̌͆́̉̊̋͐̄͊̓͛̌͌̽̒̍̇̑̐̎̕͘̕͜</p><p>̵̥͈̤̬͙̱̹̂̋̉̔̏̂̈̌̐̈́́̐̿̽̅͆̋͝</p><p≯̧̡̧̛̪͚͔̻̮̣͍͇̬̬͚͓͎̼̪̓̓̇͛̀́̂̄̓́́̍́̇̿̊͗́͂͘̕͘̚</p><p>̷͔̦̹̜̠͕̩̱̼͑ ̸̢̪̖̤̪̣̙̥͚̟͓̣͓̮̹͉͉͇͕͋̓̂̓̿͂</p><p>̶̧̢̛̛̙͚͚̖͓̪͔̟̬͎̥̰̈́̈́̂̽̆̊̔̿̿̓̃̎͆͆̓̐̕͘͠͠ ̵͙̥̋͆̈́̉͛͆̓̀̄̌̄͊̾̌̈́͊̔̽͝͠</p><p>̶̡̘̞̳̩̣͇̒̿͂͂͌̅̎͒͝ͅ ̷̧̙̭̝̺͔̣̫̠̇͑̄̍̀́̉͋͑̊̐̀̉̆̊̕</p><p≯̨̝̦̙͈̬̹̮͇͎̬̠͎͓͕̘̖̥̜̘͚͌͐</p><p>̴̫̜͚̮̹̪̊̑̊̌̏̍̃͆͘͜͝ ̸̨̡̳̱̮̲̫̲̦͈̳̘̮̭̹̘͖̙̄͒̀̎̔̓̑͆̓͌̀͛̑̐́̋̈́̚͝͝</p><p>̶̨̢̥̺̠̗̥͎͔͖̼̙͍͇͉̃̉̐͊̈́́̍̕͝j̴̭͔͇̣̜̟̥̯̱͖̦̻̦̳̭̝̮̲̽̈̋͗j̵̡̧̤̠̗͇̙̦̥̠̣̀̐̂̈̀̂̑̄̂̊͑͠͝ͅd̷̟̒̌͋̌̈̑̒̐̏͆́͑̇̀͂͋̊͆̚͠j̴̨̡̧͙͕̠̗̙͈̩̼͍̙̪͖̭̞̠̺̪̥̲̤̎̈͌͋͋̾͆̂̎͆̓̿̉͘͝ş̷̨̢̛͙̯̹̠̺̦͓̻͈̬̪͓͑̈̽͒͛͜͝ͅ</p><p>ess </p><br />

                            10. cite traits, values and traditions common to Filipinos​</h2><br />
                        1. The family<p>Filipinos are known to have strong family ties. This is why it’s common to see different generations or multiple families living in a single residence.</p><p></p><p>The family is at <strong>the center of the Filipino community</strong>. Children are not expected to leave their parents’ house until they get married. Even after then, many couples opt to stay with or close to their or their spouse’s parents.</p><p></p><p>Also, they’re expected to care for their aging parents instead of sending them to a retirement home.</p><p></p><p>The value that most Filipinos put into caring for one’s family can also be seen as one of the reasons why nurses and caregivers from the country provide their patients and clients with a high level of care.</p><p></p>2. Humor and positivity<p>Optimism, humor, and positivity are valued traits in the Philippines. Filipinos love celebrations and festivities. The country has a long list of national holidays, and many provinces and cities have their own sets of local holidays. Meanwhile, they still find quality time for their families to celebrate birthdays, Christmases, and other instances.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the face of difficult or challenging situations, members of the community are encouraged to look at the brighter side of things. The inclination for finding the good in the bad can be traced to the country’s location, which lies in the path of typhoons and sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p><p></p><p>In a place where natural calamities are commonplace, humor and positivity work as a coping mechanism, much like how some children laugh to hide their embarrassment after slipping or falling.</p><p></p>3. Flexibility and adaptability<p>The term <strong>bahala na</strong>, which can be translated to “whatever happens, happens,” is one of the more familiar phrases used in the country.</p><p></p><p>It is perhaps the most representative of how Filipinos value adaptability and quick thinking. The expression exemplifies one’s belief in a higher power and submitting one’s fate to elements that cannot be controlled.</p><p></p><p>People who use the term bahala na do not see anything wrong with it, as it serves as a sort of positive affirmation that allows them to deal with a problem right then and there.</p><p></p><p>However, those who call it a <strong>negative Filipino trait</strong> often view it as a form of fatalistic submission or a way to absolve one from the responsibility of their actions.</p><p></p>4. Faith and religion<p>Spirituality is deeply embedded in the Filipino culture. A form of animism was already being practiced in many pre-colonial societies and Islam has been firmly established in the southern islands even before the pre-Hispanic era.</p><p></p><p>These days, religion still plays a big part in society and the everyday lives of Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>The Catholic Church’s views still affect the passing of some laws, most towns still hold fiestas to honor their patron saints, and many regular non-working national holidays are dedicated to celebrating various religious activities and events.</p><p></p><p>To many Filipinos, religion helps shape their values and principles.</p><p></p>5. Filipino hospitality<p>Filipinos are <strong>naturally hospitable</strong>. Guests can be expected to extend a very warm welcome to their guests regardless of where they come from, how well they know their host, and why they’re visiting someone’s home.</p><p></p><p>Hosts typically provide their guests with food and entertainment and, if there’s time, a tour around the local destinations.</p><p></p><p>In the Philippines, no one leaves with an empty stomach. Before they leave, guests are even entreated to take home pasalubong or souvenirs, which often come in the form of delicacies and local sweets.</p><p></p>6. Other positive Filipino traits and characteristics<p>Aside from the ones mentioned, Filipinos also possess the following positive traits.</p><p></p>7. Respect for the elderly<p>Filipinos have high regard for their elderly, including their parents. Even young adults still practice taking their elders’ hands and saying “mano po” when they arrive at their homes.</p><p></p>8. Industrious attitude<p>Another one of the great characteristics of Filipinos is their being resourceful and industrious. They are determined to finish their set goals despite difficult circumstances and limited resources.</p><p></p>9. Generosity<p>Filipinos are naturally helpful and generous people. They give as much as they can and extend help to family members — and even strangers — when needed. This is seen through the abundance of charity drives and foundations in the country, especially when calamities arise.</p><br />

                            13. essay about filipino value system​</h2><br />
                        <p>The Filipino value system is a unique blend of cultural and historical influences that have shaped the way Filipinos think, behave, and relate to one another. It is deeply rooted in the country's history, which is characterized by colonization, revolution, and migration. The Filipino value system is also influenced by the country's geography, climate, and natural resources, which have shaped the way Filipinos live their lives.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important values in the Filipino value system is "family." Family is the cornerstone of Filipino society and is considered the most important social institution. Filipinos place a high value on the family unit, and they believe that family members should take care of one another, no matter what. This is why many Filipinos live in extended families, where several generations live together under one roof.</p><p></p><p>Another important value in the Filipino value system is "respect." Respect is a fundamental value in Filipino culture and is shown in many different ways. Filipinos show respect to their parents, elders, and authority figures. They also show respect to one another by using polite language and gestures, such as bowing or shaking hands.</p><p></p><p>"Bayanihan" is another important value in the Filipino value system. Bayanihan is a term that describes the spirit of communal unity and cooperation. Filipinos believe that they can achieve more together than they can alone, and they often work together to achieve common goals. Bayanihan is often seen in rural areas, where neighbors come together to help each other build houses or plant crops.</p><p></p><p>Another important value in the Filipino value system is "pakikisama." Pakikisama is a term that describes the ability to get along with others. Filipinos believe that it is important to maintain harmonious relationships with others, even if it means sacrificing their own interests. This value is often seen in the workplace, where Filipinos try to avoid conflict and maintain a positive working relationship with their colleagues.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the Filipino value system is a complex and multifaceted set of values that have been shaped by the country's history, culture, and geography. These values are deeply ingrained in the Filipino psyche and are reflected in the way Filipinos think, behave, and relate to one another. Understanding the Filipino value system is essential for anyone who wants to live and work in the Philippines, as it is a key factor in building relationships and achieving success in Filipino society.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The culture, traditions, and values of Egypt have a rich and complex history that can be traced back to ancient times. Egypt is a country with a diverse and multicultural society, and this is reflected in its culture, traditions, and values.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important aspects of Egyptian culture is its religion. Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of beliefs and practices that was central to the daily lives of the ancient Egyptians. The gods and goddesses of ancient Egypt were considered to be powerful and mysterious, and they were worshiped in temples and other sacred places. The most important god in ancient Egypt was the sun god, Ra, who was considered to be the creator of all life. Religion played a significant role in the lives of the ancient Egyptians, and it continues to play an important role in the lives of modern Egyptians. </p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of Egyptian culture is its art. Ancient Egyptian art is characterized by its realism and attention to detail. The ancient Egyptians were skilled in a variety of mediums, including painting, sculpture, and architecture. They used these mediums to create beautiful and intricate works of art that celebrated the gods and goddesses of their religion, as well as the pharaohs and other important figures.</p><p></p><p>Egyptian traditions and customs are also an important part of the culture. One of the most well-known Egyptian traditions is the celebration of Ramadan. During this month-long observance, Muslims fast during the day and gather with family and friends to break the fast at sunset. Another important tradition is the celebration of the Egyptian New Year, known as the Coptic New Year, which is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church and is based on the Julian calendar.</p><p></p><p>Egyptian values are also an important part of the culture. One of the most prominent values is the importance of family and community. Egyptians place a strong emphasis on family and community, and this is reflected in the way they interact with one another. They also value education and hard work, as these are seen as key to success in life.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the culture, traditions, and values of Egypt are rich and complex, shaped by a long and fascinating history. From its ancient religion and art to its modern traditions and values, Egypt offers a glimpse into a unique and vibrant culture that continues to inspire and captivate people from all over the world.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture of ancient Egypt is one that has fascinated people for thousands of years. This ancient civilization was rich in tradition and had a deep respect for their beliefs and values. From their religious practices to their daily customs, the culture of ancient Egypt was shaped by the Nile River and the surrounding desert. The Nile provided the ancient Egyptians with the resources they needed to survive, while the desert protected them from invasion.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important aspects of ancient Egyptian culture was their religion. The ancient Egyptians believed in many gods and goddesses, each of which had their own unique characteristics and responsibilities. They believed that the gods controlled the natural world and that by honoring them, they could ensure a good harvest and other blessings. The gods and goddesses were represented in temples and tombs, and their statues and images could be found throughout ancient Egypt. The people of ancient Egypt also believed in the afterlife, and they believed that the soul of the deceased would be judged by the god of the dead, Osiris, to determine if it would be granted eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of ancient Egyptian culture was their daily customs. The people of ancient Egypt had a strong sense of community and they worked together to build their society. Families were close-knit and often lived in large households. The men were responsible for farming and other labor, while the women were responsible for cooking, cleaning, and caring for the children. The people of ancient Egypt also valued education and many children were taught to read and write.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Egyptians also valued art and architecture, they were known for building grand pyramids and temples. The pyramids were built as tombs for the pharaohs and their queens. The most famous of these pyramids is the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is still standing today and considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Egyptian architecture also had a great sense of symmetry, balance and proportion. This can be seen in the temples and other buildings that they constructed.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the culture of ancient Egypt was rich in tradition and had a deep respect for their beliefs and values. Their religious practices, daily customs, art and architecture, all reflect the importance of community and the value placed on education, family, and the afterlife. The ancient Egyptians believed that by honoring their gods and goddesses, they could ensure a good harvest and other blessings, and also by building grand pyramids and temples, they could ensure that their pharaohs and their queens would have a place in the afterlife. The culture and tradition of ancient Egypt continue to inspire and fascinate people to this day.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>H</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>Y </strong><strong>T</strong><strong>O</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>P</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PO</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>!</strong></p><br />

                        <p> As a Filipino citizen, I have been exposed to the values, culture and traditions of my country since I was a child. Growing up in the Philippines has shaped me into the person I am today and has had a profound influence on my life. </p><p></p><p>The Filipino culture is one that is deeply rooted in respect for elders, family values and strong religious beliefs. Respect for elders is an important part of our culture; it is expected that children will show respect to their parents and other adults in their lives. This value has been instilled in me from an early age, teaching me to be respectful of those around me regardless of age or status. </p><p></p><p>Family values are also highly valued within Filipino culture; family members are expected to look out for each other’s well-being and support one another through difficult times. This value has taught me the importance of being there for my loved ones when they need it most, as well as how to be supportive even when things get tough. </p><p></p><p>Religion plays an important role in Filipino culture; many Filipinos practice Catholicism or some form of Christianity which influences our daily lives greatly. This value has taught me about faithfulness and humility, as well as how to live according to God’s will rather than my own desires or ambitions. It also serves as a reminder that no matter what happens in life, God will always be there with us if we turn towards Him with faith and trust Him with our lives. </p><p></p><p>These traditional values have had a great impact on modern society here in the Philippines; they serve as reminders that we should always strive towards being better people by respecting others regardless of age or status, looking out for our loved ones during difficult times and living according to God’s will rather than our own desires or ambitions. These values have helped shape who I am today by teaching me valuable lessons about life which I carry with me wherever I go – something which makes me proud to call myself a Filipino citizen!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong, pa brainliest nmn</p>Here, take a look at the pictures above. hope it helps ^-^]✓<p></p><br />

Ginagamit ito ng mga tao sa kasalukuyan upang ilarawan ang isang pagbuhos ng espiritu ng pamayanan - habang ibinibigay ng mga tao ang kanilang lahat sa karaniwang kabutihan, nang hindi inaasahan ang pagkilala o personal na pakinabang.</p><p></p><p><strong>Panliligaw (Courtship)</strong></p><p>Tayong mga Pilipino ay napaka romantikong pagdating sa usapin sa puso. Ang Serenading o Harana sa Tagalog ay isa sa pinakatanyag na uri ng panliligaw upang maipakita na ang isang lalaki ay seryoso sa kanyang hangarin sa isang babae. Ang isang serenade ay mangangailangan ng binata na kumanta ng isang love song sa harap ng bahay ng dalaga. Karaniwan, kasama niya ang kanyang mga lalaking kaibigan na kumikilos bilang back-up singers. Ang lalaki mismo o ang kanyang kaibigan ang tumugtog ng instrumento, karaniwang isang gitara, na nagbibigay ng background na musika sa kanyang kanta.</p><p></p><p><strong>Pamahiin (Superstition) </strong></p><p>Sa Pilipinas, lumago ang mga pamahiin na pamahiin sa buong bansa. Ang mga paniniwalang ito ay nagmula sa iba't ibang mga kasabihan at paniniwala ng ating mga ninuno na naglalayong maiwasan ang panganib na mangyari o upang pigilan ang isang tao na gumawa ng isang partikular na bagay.

                            26. Write a Reflective Essay about Filipino Values, Culture and Tradition that affects modern influence of today as a Filipino Citizen.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>As a Filipino citizen, I have been exposed to various values, culture, and traditions that are deeply ingrained in our society. These aspects of our identity have shaped the way we live our lives and interact with others. Our values, culture, and traditions have been passed down from generation to generation, and they continue to have a significant impact on our daily lives.</strong></p><p></p><p>One of the most prominent Filipino values that I have observed is the value of close family ties. In our culture, family always comes first. We are taught to respect and care for our elders, and we are expected to help out our family members in times of need. This value is evident in the way we celebrate important occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and other significant milestones. It is common for families to come together and celebrate these events with great enthusiasm, showcasing the unity and love that exists within our families.</p><p></p><p>Another significant aspect of Filipino culture is our deep religious faith. Religion plays a significant role in our lives, and it is reflected in our daily practices and beliefs. Our religious values have instilled in us the importance of respect, humility, and compassion towards others. We believe that by being good and living a life according to our faith, we can make the world a better place.</p><p></p><p>Filipino traditions and customs also play a vital role in shaping our identity. For instance, the practice of “bayanihan,” which is a spirit of communal unity and cooperation, is still evident in many rural areas. The concept of “utang na loob,” or a sense of indebtedness to someone who has done you a favor, is another example of how Filipino customs and traditions have shaped our character.</p><p></p><p>However, as a modern Filipino citizen, I also recognize that some aspects of our culture may not be applicable or appropriate in the modern world. For example, some traditional gender roles may not be suitable in today's society, and there is a need to promote gender equality and respect for diversity.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, Filipino values, culture, and traditions have had a significant influence on who we are as a people. As a Filipino citizen, I am proud of our rich culture and traditions, but I also recognize the need to adapt and adjust to the changing times. We need to embrace the positive aspects of our culture and traditions while also being open to change and progress. By doing so, we can continue to uphold our identity as a people and make a positive contribution to the world.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            28. what filipino trait values cultures or traditions​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>The family</p><p>Filipinos are known to have strong family ties. This is why it’s common to see different generations or multiple families living in a single residence.</p><p></p><p>The family is at the center of the Filipino community. Children are not expected to leave their parents’ house until they get married. Even after then, many couples opt to stay with or close to their or their spouse’s parents.</p><p></p><p>Also, they’re expected to care for their aging parents instead of sending them to a retirement home.</p><p></p><p>The value that most Filipinos put into caring for one’s family can also be seen as one of the reasons why nurses and caregivers from the country provide their patients and clients with a high level of care.</p><p></p><p>Humor and positivity</p><p>Optimism, humor, and positivity are valued traits in the Philippines.</p><p>Filipinos love celebrations and festivities. The country has a long list of national holidays, and many provinces and cities have their own sets of local holidays. Meanwhile, they still find quality time for their families to celebrate birthdays, Christmases, and other instances.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the face of difficult or challenging situations, members of the community are encouraged to look at the brighter side of things. The inclination for finding the good in the bad can be traced to the country’s location, which lies in the path of typhoons and sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p><p></p><p>In a place where natural calamities are commonplace, humor and positivity work as a coping mechanism, much like how some children laugh to hide their embarrassment after slipping or falling.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What are Filipinos known for?</p><p>Flexibility and adaptability</p><p>The term bahala na, which can be translated to “whatever happens, happens,” is one of the more familiar phrases used in the country.</p><p></p><p>It is perhaps the most representative of how Filipinos value adaptability and quick thinking. The expression exemplifies one’s belief in a higher power and submitting one’s fate to elements that cannot be controlled.</p><p></p><p>People who use the term bahala na do not see anything wrong with it, as it serves as a sort of positive affirmation that allows them to deal with a problem right then and there.</p><p></p><p>However, those who call it a negative Filipino trait often view it as a form of fatalistic submission or a way to absolve one from the responsibility of their actions.</p><p></p><p>Faith and religion</p><p>Spirituality is deeply embedded in the Filipino culture. A form of animism was already being practiced in many pre-colonial societies and Islam has been firmly established in the southern islands even before the pre-Hispanic era.</p><p></p><p>These days, religion still plays a big part in society and the everyday lives of Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>The Catholic Church’s views still affect the passing of some laws, most towns still hold fiestas to honor their patron saints, and many regular non-working national holidays are dedicated to celebrating various religious activities and events.</p><p></p><p>To many Filipinos, religion helps shape their values and principles.</p><p></p><p>Filipino hospitality</p><p>Filipinos are naturally hospitable. Guests can be expected to extend a very warm welcome to their guests regardless of where they come from, how well they know their host, and why they’re visiting someone’s home.</p><p></p><p>Hosts typically provide their guests with food and entertainment and, if there’s time, a tour around the local destinations.</p><p></p><p>In the Philippines, no one leaves with an empty stomach. Before they leave, guests are even entreated to take home pasalubong or souvenirs, which often come in the form of delicacies and local sweets.</p><p></p><p>Other positive Filipino traits and characteristics</p><p>Aside from the ones mentioned, Filipinos also possess the following positive traits.</p><p></p><p>Respect for the elderly</p><p>Filipinos have high regard for their elderly, including their parents. Even young adults still practice taking their elders’ hands and saying “mano po” when they arrive at their homes.</p><p></p><p>Industrious attitude</p><p>Another one of the great characteristics of Filipinos is their being resourceful and industrious. They are determined to finish their set goals despite difficult circumstances and limited resources.</p><p></p><p>Generosity</p><p>Filipinos are naturally helpful and generous people. They give as much as they can and extend help to family members — and even strangers — when needed. This is seen through the abundance of charity drives and foundations in the country, especially when calamities arise.</p><br />
