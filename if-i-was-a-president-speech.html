                            1. 3rd quarter speech about president if I am a president of this Philippines​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My fellow Filipinos,</p><p></p><p>Today, I stand before you as the President of the Philippines, humbled by the trust and confidence you have bestowed upon me. I am honored to have been elected as the leader of this great nation, and I vow to work tirelessly to serve the people of the Philippines to the best of my abilities.</p><p></p><p>As we face the challenges of the modern world, we must come together as a nation to overcome them. The problems we face are daunting, but I am confident that with hard work and determination, we can overcome any obstacle.</p><p></p><p>One of the most pressing issues we face today is poverty. Too many of our fellow Filipinos are living in extreme poverty, struggling to make ends meet. As President, I pledge to prioritize poverty reduction efforts, including increasing access to education, job training, and economic opportunities. We will work to create jobs and stimulate economic growth, particularly in the rural areas of our country.</p><p></p><p>Another critical issue we must address is corruption. Corruption undermines our government's credibility and erodes the trust of our people. As President, I vow to root out corruption at all levels of government and implement measures to prevent it from occurring in the future. We will hold those who engage in corrupt practices accountable for their actions and ensure that justice is served.</p><p></p><p>We must also prioritize investments in infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, to improve connectivity and promote economic development. Our roads, bridges, and ports must be modernized to support the growth of our economy and improve the quality of life for our citizens.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, we must address the issue of climate change. The effects of climate change are already being felt in our country, and we must take action to mitigate its impact. As President, I will work to increase investments in renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions, and promote sustainable development practices.</p><p></p><p>My fellow Filipinos, the challenges we face are great, but I am confident that together, we can overcome them. Let us work hand in hand to build a brighter future for ourselves and future generations. Thank you, and Mabuhay ang Pilipinas</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My fellow Filipinos,</p><p></p><p>I stand before you today as the President of this great nation, humbled by the trust and confidence you have placed in me to lead our country forward.</p><p></p><p>I believe that a strong and prosperous Philippines is within our reach, but it will require hard work, sacrifice, and unity. As your President, I am committed to working tirelessly to achieve our shared goals and aspirations.</p><p></p><p>One of my top priorities is to address poverty and inequality in our country. No Filipino should go hungry or without basic necessities. We will work towards creating more job opportunities and increasing access to education and healthcare for all Filipinos, regardless of their social status.</p><p></p><p>We will also prioritize the protection and promotion of human rights, and ensure that justice is served for all. No one should be above the law, including those in positions of power.</p><p></p><p>Another key area of focus will be the protection of our environment. We are blessed with beautiful natural resources, and it is our responsibility to preserve and protect them for future generations.</p><p></p><p>We will also work towards enhancing our international relationships and promoting regional stability. We recognize the importance of our relationships with other nations, and we will work towards building stronger partnerships and collaborations.</p><p></p><p>As your President, I believe in transparency, accountability, and open communication. I will be accessible to all Filipinos, and will listen to your concerns and suggestions. I am committed to working with all sectors of society to build a brighter future for our nation.</p><p></p><p>In closing, let me assure you that the Philippines has a bright future. Together, we will work towards achieving our shared goals and aspirations, and building a nation that we can all be proud of. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps </p><p>pa heart and follow po</p><p></p><p>"My fellow Filipinos,</p><p></p><p>As your President, it is my honor and privilege to address you today, during this third quarter of my term.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude for the trust and confidence that you have bestowed upon me. It is my promise that I will continue to serve the country to the best of my abilities.</p><p></p><p>The past few months have been challenging for our nation. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected not only our health but also our economy and daily lives. Rest assured that my administration is doing everything in our power to contain the spread of the virus and provide the necessary aid to those who have been affected by this crisis.</p><p></p><p>But as we move forward, let us not lose sight of our other national concerns. We need to continue our efforts to combat corruption, promote education, and uplift the lives of the poor and marginalized sectors.</p><p></p><p>As your President, I am committed to making significant strides towards these goals. I will push for more efficient and transparent governance, with a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption. I will also work towards providing access to quality education for all Filipinos, regardless of their socio-economic status.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, I will continue to prioritize the needs of our country's most vulnerable sectors, such as our farmers, fisherfolks, and informal settlers. I will make sure that they are given the opportunities and support they need to improve their lives.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, I call upon all of us to unite as one nation towards achieving these goals. Together, we can overcome any challenge that comes our way. Let us embrace the values of hard work, discipline, and compassion, as we work towards a brighter future for our country.</p><p></p><p>Maraming salamat po, at mabuhay ang Pilipinas!"</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>Thank you very much for inviting me to your wonderful state here in the great heartland of America but also pretty near the coast. It is an honor to speak from this podium, in this storied courthouse, where so many profound legal judgments were handed down that they more or less canceled each other out.</p><p>All subscriptions placed before March 1st will begin with Black Imagination After years of of popular demand from the clamoring masses, we are at last revamping and relaunching our McSweeney's...</p><p></p><p>I am a simple man with a Harvard degree and a solid understanding of tractors. When I was a young boy, my father took me on his knee and told me the principle that has guided my life ever since: “Agree with some things, disagree with other things.” His was truly the Greatest Generation, along with a few that came before and a couple that have come since.</p><p></p><p>Why am I running for president of the United States of America? That’s a good question, and perhaps there’s no good way to answer it. Or perhaps there is a good way to answer it. Either way, it’s a good question and I’m glad it was raised.</p><p></p><p>I want to talk a little bit about our nation’s children. Before this speech, a young man named Stanley Exley came up to me. Stanley is a mechanic, a noble profession if there ever was one. Or perhaps he is a chemistry professor, also noble. He was holding his small daughter, Emily, an adorable 3-year-old who was recently diagnosed with leukemia. Stanley is a straight shooter, and he came up to me and asked me a question I’ll never forget: “Do you like children?” And I looked him straight in the eye and said, “Yes, Stanley, I very much like children.” Maybe that’s not a popular opinion, but it’s what I believe. And to those of you who would say, “I don’t think children are our future,” I must reply in the strongest of terms: “I disagree.” Sometimes you have to take a stand for what you believe in.</p><p></p><p>Our country is sharply divided over a war that is being waged in a distant land. My views on this war are clear: it is happening, it is happening in Iraq, and it will continue to happen until it stops. Some people believe we should withdraw all the troops now. Some people believe we should stay and fight until we’ve established a stable nation. Some people believe we should gradually hand over control to the Iraqi government. I feel blessed to live in a country with so many beliefs.</p><p>McSweeney's is ecstatic to announce that we've been nominated for the 2020 National Magazine Award for fiction. In celebration of this incredible news, we've put together a special bundle just for...</p><p></p><p>On the subject of South African apartheid: I strongly, strongly, strongly oppose it. I’m glad it’s gone, and I hope it never comes back.</p><p></p><p>The state of our economy is in flux. Every single day, the stock market goes up or goes down or stays the same. If elected president, I will ask the Federal Reserve to take a good long look at the interest rate and decide whether or not to change it. If elected president, I will create jobs where there are none, and where there are jobs, I will create internships.</p><p></p><p>Let us take actions that will make people happy.</p><p></p><p>Let us take actions that will make people healthy or perhaps have the private sector do it.</p><p>Subscribe to our National Magazine Award-winning, somewhat accurately named, McSweeney’s Quarterly today.</p><p></p><p>Let us take actions regarding taxes.</p><p></p><p>And let us move boldly so that our children and our children’s children can look back and say, “I’m glad they moved boldly on this, this, and that.”</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><p></p><p>    Speeches Presidents Votes Campaigns </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Answer:Here is an unedited transcript of President Obama’s prepared remarks during his farewell address in Chicago, as provided by the White House.
---
It’s good to be home. My fellow Americans, Michelle and I have been so touched by all the well-wishes we’ve received over the past few weeks. But tonight it’s my turn to say thanks. Whether we’ve seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people – in living rooms and schools; at farms and on factory floors; at diners and on distant outposts – are what have kept me honest, kept me inspired, and kept me going. Every day, I learned from you. You made me a better president, and you made me a better man.
I first came to Chicago when I was in my early 20s, still trying to figure out who I was; still searching for a purpose to my life. It was in neighborhoods not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss. This is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it.Explanation:<br />

"</p><p>Reported Speech: Leni said that she​ bought some eseentials earlier.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Direct speech describes when something is being repeated exactly as it was – usually in between a pair of inverted commas. For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>She told me, “I’ll come home by 10pm.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Indirect speech will still share the same information – but instead of expressing someone’s comments or speech by directly repeating them, it involves reporting or describing what was said. An obvious difference is that with indirect speech, you won’t use inverted commas. For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>She said to me that she would come home by 10pm.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><br />

I can understand what he was saying.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tone</strong></p><p>His tone changes as he was talking about different topics. Overall, he sounded passionate and sincere of what he was addressing to the audience.</p><p></p><p><strong>Volume</strong></p><p>He was loud, but not in an overwhelming way. It was also to drown out the loud cheers from the audience. </p><p></p><p><strong>Speed (Fast or Slow)</strong></p><p>Mostly, the speed of his speech was moderate. Sometimes he slowed down but all in all, it was neither fast nor slow. </p><p></p><p><strong>Word Choice (Attitude and Certainty)</strong></p><p>At some points of the speech, he tells his personal stories, so the word choice was more casual. For the most part, he sounded professional because of his usage of elegant words. </p><p></p><p><strong>Cohesion (Organization)</strong></p><p>In my opinion, the cohesion of his speech was good. It wasn't muddy or incoherent and I understood his speech. </p><p></p><p><strong>Correctness (Rightness and Precision of Grammar) </strong></p><p>Obama's grammar was really good. There wasn't any obvious grammar errors with his speech. He sounded intelligent. </p><p></p><p>-</p><p>pa proof-read nalang. Welcome :)</p><br />

                        <p>John F. Kennedy's Inaugural speech was given on January 20th, 1961. He spoke to not only the citizens of the United States, but to the entire world. It was clear that his main goal was to unify the entire human race and to make the world a better place for everyone. John F. Kennedy was calling on all Americans to be the difference, to take a stand, to make the change, and to do what is morally right. There was a great reference to our country being the first to revolt against the will of greedy men, and that we are the heirs of that revolution with the duty to uphold and bring basic human rights to all human beings across the globe. His great use of logic and powerful emotions used throughout the speech brought this sense of duty, argued his call to action, and allowed his words to be quite effective in the unification of the citizens of the United States and the rest of the world together.</p><br />
