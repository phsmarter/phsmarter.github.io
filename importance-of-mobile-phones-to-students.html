                                            QUARTER 1 MODULE 2 Directions: Read the passages below and determine how each is mainly structured. On a sheet of paper, answer the questions that follow and put the information from each passage in an appropriate graphic organizer. Feel free to make changes of the graphic organizer if necessary. Passage 1 Earthquakes happen all over the world in areas called seismic zones. Seismic zones occur where the plates of crust covering the Earth’s surface meet each other. Inside the Earth, the mantle is always moving, which in turn moves the plates. These plates push against each other, building up tension between them. When the tension between plates becomes too great, they grind against each other, causing the Earth’s surface to tremble and shake. Passage 2 I have noticed that a lot of people are confused about mobile data and Wi-fi. Some people think that they’re the same thing. Both mobile data and Wi-fi allow you to connect to the internet. However, there are some important differences between them. Mobile data is provided by the mobile phone company. Whereas, Wi-fi is comes through cable or phone lines. Mobile data gives you internet access anywhere that your phone can get a signal. But, you can only get Wi-fi access when you are near a router. Customers are usually given a nearly unlimited amount of Wi-fi data, like an all-you-can-eat buffet. On the other hand, mobile data is often sold in limited portions, like an expensive restaurant. It is important to know which you are using so that you aren’t charged additional fees for going over your mobile data plan limits. Passage 3 In the center of Luna’s Spoliarium painting are fallen gladiators being dragged by Roman soldiers. At the left side, spectators ardently await their chance to strip off the combatants of their metal helmets and other armory. In addition, emotions are featured on the left and the right side presents a sober mood. It can be seen also in the right side; an old man carries a torch perhaps searching for his son while a woman weeps the death of her loved one. Passage 4 The first step of changing oil in a car is to gather supplies. After you have collected all of the tools and supplies, prepare your vehicle. Start the car and let it run for one to two minutes to warm the oil and the engine. Then, find a flat surface to jack the vehicle from the center under the engine. Next, locate the oil filter and oil drain plug. Put on work gloves to protect your hands and position an oil drain pan under the engine then remove the plug the rest of the way. Passage 5 What is an ice cream headache? It is when a painful sensation resonates in your head after eating something cold (usually ice cream) on a hot day. This pain is produced by the dilation of a nerve in the roof of your mouth. The nerve center is overreacting to the cold by trying to heat your brain. It is an ice cream headache when you feel those sensations which have turned many smiles to frowns. Passage 6 Some students have poor attendance. The school has tried many ways of addressing this such as teachers have sent letters and/or have talked to parents immediately, school has scheduled parent/ teacher/ guidance counsellor/ school prefect of discipline conferences with students who are habitually absent. Hopefully, this will help more students get to school every day ​</a>

                                            Directions: Read the argumentative text below and answer the questions that follow.Use of Mobile Phones in Schools     The use of mobile or cell phones in learning institutions, specifically schools, has elicited debate and bitter arguments, not only in the United States of America, but in the world as a whole. While part of society has supported the use of cellphones in schools, the other part has opposed their use bitterly. Mobile phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, have targeted students as their main market and thus they have designed various models with lots of features in order to attract them. Despite the fact that the use of mobile phones by students in schools can be used positively and constructively in order to enhance their learning, the same technological devices can be utilized negatively, which distracts them and their teachers and in turn disrupts the learning process. For instance, whilst the students can use mobile phones positively by accessing or downloading important academic materials from the worldwide web, the same can also be used to get access towards destructive pornographic or undesirable contents from online sources thus destroying students’ morals. There are various reasons as to why mobile phones should not be used by students in schools and other learning institutions through giving tangible evidence. There are various arguments from critics calling for the use of mobile phones in schools by the students.Questions:1. What makes the use of mobile phones debatable?5. What are the modal verbs used in the text?​</a>

                            10. Let Us Enhance Ourselves!It's your time to show what you have learned from the lessons.Understanding literature entails knowing the world of the writers.Thus, in order to grasp what they really want to convey in their texts,you should be ready to join the encounters worth cherishing throughsharing your honest opinion regarding how the actions, dialogues andthoughts of the characters are presented. Many writers useargumentative texts to persuade the readers to agree to their points ofview. The issue and the supporting (pros) and opposing (cons)opinions about the issue must be noted.One of most important things we do is provide relevance for you.It gives you a context within which you can develop into engaged,motivated and self-regulated learners. Relevance can help you realizehow useful all knowledge can be.1. What are the reasons for not allowing students to bring mobilephones to school?2. What facts are used to support the argument? Are theseconvincing?​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p>"I study literature because I believe there is power in stories. Literature is both intensely personal as well as a communal experience. I love examining how words, sentences, characters, plot-lines and tropes reveal who we are as humans. Humanity is a complicated thing, and requires an infinite amount of words to describe and analyze. That's the joy of studying literature, there is always a new reality to discover."<p></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p></p>i hope it helps#carry on lerning<br />

                            11. QUARTER 1 MODULE 2 Directions: Read the passages below and determine how each is mainly structured. On a sheet of paper, answer the questions that follow and put the information from each passage in an appropriate graphic organizer. Feel free to make changes of the graphic organizer if necessary. Passage 1 Earthquakes happen all over the world in areas called seismic zones. Seismic zones occur where the plates of crust covering the Earth’s surface meet each other. Inside the Earth, the mantle is always moving, which in turn moves the plates. These plates push against each other, building up tension between them. When the tension between plates becomes too great, they grind against each other, causing the Earth’s surface to tremble and shake. Passage 2 I have noticed that a lot of people are confused about mobile data and Wi-fi. Some people think that they’re the same thing. Both mobile data and Wi-fi allow you to connect to the internet. However, there are some important differences between them. Mobile data is provided by the mobile phone company. Whereas, Wi-fi is comes through cable or phone lines. Mobile data gives you internet access anywhere that your phone can get a signal. But, you can only get Wi-fi access when you are near a router. Customers are usually given a nearly unlimited amount of Wi-fi data, like an all-you-can-eat buffet. On the other hand, mobile data is often sold in limited portions, like an expensive restaurant. It is important to know which you are using so that you aren’t charged additional fees for going over your mobile data plan limits. Passage 3 In the center of Luna’s Spoliarium painting are fallen gladiators being dragged by Roman soldiers. At the left side, spectators ardently await their chance to strip off the combatants of their metal helmets and other armory. In addition, emotions are featured on the left and the right side presents a sober mood. It can be seen also in the right side; an old man carries a torch perhaps searching for his son while a woman weeps the death of her loved one. Passage 4 The first step of changing oil in a car is to gather supplies. After you have collected all of the tools and supplies, prepare your vehicle. Start the car and let it run for one to two minutes to warm the oil and the engine. Then, find a flat surface to jack the vehicle from the center under the engine. Next, locate the oil filter and oil drain plug. Put on work gloves to protect your hands and position an oil drain pan under the engine then remove the plug the rest of the way. Passage 5 What is an ice cream headache? It is when a painful sensation resonates in your head after eating something cold (usually ice cream) on a hot day. This pain is produced by the dilation of a nerve in the roof of your mouth. The nerve center is overreacting to the cold by trying to heat your brain. It is an ice cream headache when you feel those sensations which have turned many smiles to frowns. Passage 6 Some students have poor attendance. The school has tried many ways of addressing this such as teachers have sent letters and/or have talked to parents immediately, school has scheduled parent/ teacher/ guidance counsellor/ school prefect of discipline conferences with students who are habitually absent. Hopefully, this will help more students get to school every day ​</h2><br />

Whether or not students should be allowed to bring their mobile phones to school depends on the age and maturity of the students and the school's policy.

                            20. Directions: Read the argumentative text below and answer the questions that follow.Use of Mobile Phones in Schools     The use of mobile or cell phones in learning institutions, specifically schools, has elicited debate and bitter arguments, not only in the United States of America, but in the world as a whole. While part of society has supported the use of cellphones in schools, the other part has opposed their use bitterly. Mobile phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, have targeted students as their main market and thus they have designed various models with lots of features in order to attract them. Despite the fact that the use of mobile phones by students in schools can be used positively and constructively in order to enhance their learning, the same technological devices can be utilized negatively, which distracts them and their teachers and in turn disrupts the learning process. For instance, whilst the students can use mobile phones positively by accessing or downloading important academic materials from the worldwide web, the same can also be used to get access towards destructive pornographic or undesirable contents from online sources thus destroying students’ morals. There are various reasons as to why mobile phones should not be used by students in schools and other learning institutions through giving tangible evidence. There are various arguments from critics calling for the use of mobile phones in schools by the students.Questions:1. What makes the use of mobile phones debatable?5.
