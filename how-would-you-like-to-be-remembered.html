The songs I composed are mostly products of my treasured memories which I want to share with you. I wanted you to feel the happiness I once enjoyed. I want you to look at life as if pain and suffering do not exist. Living the life God gave us is the most precious thing we could do to show God how grateful we are for His gift.
