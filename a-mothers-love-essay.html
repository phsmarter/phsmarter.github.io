Activity Directions: Read the selection and answer the questions that 
follow.
Xyza and Xyriel are twins. Their mother tells them that even when 
they look alike, they have different attitudes. Xyza is more outgoing 
and I love sports. She also convinced her mom to enroll her in a 
dancing school, for she really loves dancing. Someday, she wants to 
win an international award for being a good dancer. On the other 
hand, Xyriel prefers solitary activities more. She loves drawing and 
painting. Xyriel is always with her sketch pad, and she loves 
traveling because she finds new things to draw in every place she 
visits. They both help their mother in doing house chores. They also 
study their lessons very well. Xyza and Xyriel may have different 
hobbies and personalities, but no matter how different they are, 
they really love each other, and wish they could reach their dreams 
in the future.

                        "MOTHER'S LOVE"<p></p><p></p><p>Mother is the most selfless person in this world who starts loving her children even before they come into this world. Nothing could be compared to a mother’s love in this world as it is the purest form of love. Mother is like an angel for her child, who always loves her child and supports him/her. For every child, his mother has a special place in his heart because she is the first person the child sees after his birth. This is the reason why a child and a mother have a special bond between them. But not all people are fortunate enough to have mother love in their life due to many reasons. Those who have their mother with them must love and respect her.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother is the greatest gift for a child by God. It is the mother who always loves her children without expecting anything from them in return. It won't be wrong to say that women are an inherently good mother, but they realise the power of mother-love when they become a mother. A mother can do anything to protect her child, and she is the primary support of a child. She not only morally supports the child but also prepares her child to be a better person in life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPEITHELPS</p><br />

Your mother who was delighted by her presence cooks her best dish for your friend. Your friend loved the whole lunch that she kept complementing your mother for being such a good cook. At the end of her visit, she expresses her gratitude to the whole family. Before she leaves, she approaches your mother and asks, "how much do I pay you for the lunch you cooked for me? (Ariely, 2010)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>My reaction/ or my mother’s reaction:
</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>“How much do I pay for the lunch you cooked for me?”
</p><p>Is more likely a light-hearted compliment and joke. Because you pay something in exchange of something really good. I believe the friend was superbly delighted by the cooking that she compared it to be similar  when eating in a restaurant. She supposes that the mother should be paid by her talent, time, and effort in cooking.  </p><p>Off course, visitors are treated as special and being hospitable, we just laugh off these kinds of comments. They are not meant to be offensive but rather highly appreciative.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/11367325</p><br />

Activity Directions: Read the selection and answer the questions that 
follow.
Xyza and Xyriel are twins. Their mother tells them that even when 
they look alike, they have different attitudes. Xyza is more outgoing 
and I love sports. She also convinced her mom to enroll her in a 
dancing school, for she really loves dancing. Someday, she wants to 
win an international award for being a good dancer. On the other 
hand, Xyriel prefers solitary activities more. She loves drawing and 
painting. Xyriel is always with her sketch pad, and she loves 
traveling because she finds new things to draw in every place she 
visits. They both help their mother in doing house chores. They also 
study their lessons very well. Xyza and Xyriel may have different 
hobbies and personalities, but no matter how different they are, 
they really love each other, and wish they could reach their dreams 
in the future.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: Mother's Love</p><p></p><p>A mother's love is like no other. It is unconditional, selfless, and pure. From the moment a child is born, a mother's life revolves around ensuring the wellbeing of her child. A mother is the first person that a child sees and feels, and the bond they share is unbreakable. A mother's love is a beautiful thing, but it is also incredibly powerful. It has the ability to heal and soothe, to inspire great acts of bravery, and to bring immense joy and happiness. </p><p></p><p>A mother's love is evident in all the small things she does. It's seen in the way she cooks and packs lunches for her children or how she wakes up early in the morning to make sure they get to school on time. It's the way she tucks them into bed at night, telling them stories and singing lullabies. A mother's love is also found in the way she teaches her children valuable life lessons and offers guidance when they stray off the right path. </p><p></p><p>Although a mother's love is powerful, it's not always easy. It requires patience, sacrifice, and tough love at times. Mothers have to make difficult choices, and sometimes they have to be the bad guy to ensure their child's safety and success. But even in moments of discipline, a mother's love remains unwavering. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a mother's love is a force to be reckoned with. It is the purest form of love and has the power to shape a child's life. Whether it's providing comfort in times of sadness or celebrating their successes, a mother's love is always present. It's a gift that keeps on giving even as we grow older. So let us never take our Mother's love for granted and cherish it in our hearts forever.</p><br />

Everyone has a mom and a dad, and most parents love their parents unconditionally; so in return kids should show honor towards their parents through love as well. In order to honor your mother and father, one must show respect, obedience, and especially honesty towards them. Everyone must be honest with their parents no matter how hard it is to be. The Bible and God demand honesty, especially towards your parents. In order to fully honor your parents you must also try to be completely honest with them. White lies are often told and thought of as no big deal, but after a while they will lead to bigger lies that could get people into serious trouble. Being honest with your parents is so important because your mother and father need to become fully involved with your life even if it is hard for you to let them. Your parents want to be a part of your lives, but without honesty they are unable to. Also, in order to be honest with your parents, you must also be honest with oneself. Honoring your mother and father is one of the most important things in life because it includes, respect, obedience, and honesty. One's parents need to receive great honor from their children because they love them with all of their hearts.</p><p></p><br />
