What is the main question that the film seeks to answer?3. What is your own reflection and understanding based on the film?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>  Reflection Paper about "Jose Rizal" Film of GMA by Marilou Diaz Abaya.<p></p><p></p><p>   The film "Jose Rizal" directed by Marilou Diaz-Abaya is an epic biopic that portrays the life of the Philippine national hero, Jose Rizal. The film begins with Rizal's childhood in Calamba, Laguna, where he showed exceptional intelligence and artistic talent. It then follows his journey to Europe, where he continued his studies and experienced racism and discrimination. The film also depicts Rizal's romantic relationships with Leonor Rivera and Josephine Bracken.</p><p></p><p>   The movie highlights Rizal's patriotism and his love for his country. It shows how he used his intelligence and creativity to fight for the Filipino people's rights and freedoms. The film portrays Rizal as a man of integrity, who stood up against the Spanish colonizers' oppression and corruption.</p><p></p><p>   The main question that the film seeks to answer is, "<strong>What made Jose Rizal a hero?</strong>" The movie answers this question by showcasing Rizal's love for his country, his intellectual prowess, and his unwavering dedication to fighting for the Filipino people's rights and freedoms. It also highlights his works, such as his novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," which exposed the injustices and corruption of the Spanish colonial government.</p><p></p><p>   My own reflection and understanding based on the film is that Jose Rizal was truly a remarkable individual who used his talents and intellect to bring about change and fight for his country's freedom. The film reminded me of the importance of critical thinking, education, and standing up for what is right. It also reminded me of the sacrifices that our ancestors made for us to enjoy the freedoms and rights that we have today. Overall, the film "Jose Rizal" is a masterpiece that every Filipino should watch to gain a deeper understanding of our national hero's life and legacy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Don't forget to leave a like!</p><p>Follow for more!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Dr. Jose Rizal's second homecoming</strong> can be read in Life, Works, and Accomplishments of Jose Rizal. It is under <strong>chapter 21</strong> entitled "Jose Rizal's Second Homecoming and La Liga Filipina".</p><p></p><p>Here is a 4-paragraph reflection paper about <strong>Dr. Jose Rizal's 2nd homecoming.</strong> It also includes his plans, projects, and socio-political actions.​</p><p></p>                  The Second Homecoming<p></p><p>             <strong>Rizal </strong>wanted to personally talk to <strong>Despujol </strong>concerning his <strong>Borneo colonization project.</strong> He was in Hong Kong at that time but he left the country on June 21, 1892, along with his sister Lucia. I felt really proud of his action because of his initiatives to give the landless Filipinos to at least settle in north Borneo. I wish he was not steadfast in his decision because he had no idea that a secret case had been filed against him for the <strong>anti-religious and anti-patriotic campaign</strong>.</p><p></p><p>             Rizal and Lucia arrived in Manila at noon on <strong>June 26, 1892</strong>, and on the same day, at 7:00 PM, he was able to talk with Despujol who agreed to pardon his father. Rizal was also told that he should return on the 29th of June. On the evening of July 3rd, <strong>Rizal lead a meeting in Tondo, Manila</strong> which was attended by more than 20 Filipinos including <strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong> and <strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong>. I was so amazed by how Rizal was able to convince fellow Filipino heroes and spearhead a conference for the country.</p><p></p><p>             They discussed the <strong>La Liga Filipina</strong> and Rizal thoroughly discussed the aims of this association. They even elected officers with Ambrosio Salvador as the president. In my opinion, they are slowly getting into awakening their <strong>patriotism </strong>and love for the country. If they were not able to hold the said meeting, everything will be worthless because three days after, <strong>they sabotaged Rizal</strong> and Despujol's meeting causing <strong>Rizal's imprisonment in Fort Santiago.</strong></p><p></p><p>             I was so glad about the outcome of how <strong>Rizal planned everything</strong> even if the end of his life was really tragic. We could not have the freedom we are enjoying right now if not because of his brilliant mindset and the cooperation of his fellow Filipino heroes. <strong>I am so proud of our national</strong> hero and it only proves that you do not always need physical means to win in battles.</p><p>                                                    -end-</p><p></p><p>If you want to learn more about the life and works of Rizal, please head over to this link directly:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/6934237</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
