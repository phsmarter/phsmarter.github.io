                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The K to 12 Program is a comprehensive educational reform initiative in the Philippines that aims to enhance the quality of basic education by adding two years to the old ten-year system. This initiative was implemented to address the issues and challenges in the educational system of the country. Since its implementation in 2012, it has been met with both positive and negative feedback. However, in this essay, we will be focusing on the positive effects of the K to 12 Program.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Preparing students for college and employment</p><p>The additional two years in the K to 12 Program allow students to gain more knowledge and skills that are essential in their chosen field. The program provides them with specialized courses in the last two years of senior high school, allowing them to develop their interests and passions. This preparation for college and employment leads to better job opportunities and higher salaries in the future.</p><p></p><p>Development of 21st-century skills</p><p>The K to 12 Program focuses on developing the 21st-century skills of students. It emphasizes critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. The program promotes the use of technology and interactive teaching methods, providing students with a more engaging and practical learning experience.</p><p></p><p>Better opportunities for further studies</p><p>With the additional two years of senior high school, students can now have more time to prepare for their chosen field. They can take specialized courses that cater to their interests, which can give them a better chance of getting into their desired college course. The K to 12 Program also provides them with a better chance of qualifying for scholarships and grants.</p><p></p><p>Improved quality of education</p><p>The K to 12 Program aims to enhance the quality of basic education in the Philippines. It introduces new teaching methods, innovative curriculum, and modern facilities that are essential in providing quality education. The program also promotes continuous professional development for teachers, ensuring that they are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to deliver quality education to their students.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The K to 12 Program has been implemented to address the issues and challenges in the Philippine educational system. Although it has received negative feedback, the positive effects of the program cannot be ignored. The K to 12 Program has prepared students for college and employment, developed their 21st-century skills, provided better opportunities for further studies, and improved the quality of education in the Philippines. These positive effects of the program will have a significant impact on the future of the Filipino youth and the country as a whole.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Abstract</strong>This triangulation study assessed pre-service teachers of their readiness to functionally utilize Information and Communication Technology (ICT) – based teaching strategies and techniques as corroborated with new graduates’ related experiences.Their knowledge in ICT-based teaching acquired from the educational technology courses in teacher education was correlated with their attitudes and perceptions toward the use of these strategies in causing functional learning, their perceived readiness, and technological practices. Subsequently, issues concerning the use of ICT-based strategies learned in college were sought from graduates of teacher education through exposition of experiences in their respective workplaces.This study ultimately revealed that the educational technology course experiences were not responsive enough to capacitate pre-service teachers to enact ICT-based strategies toward functional learning of their future students. They generally believe that their knowledge, potentials, and skills were not adequate to maximize ICT in designing and implementing curricular programs when they become full-fledged teachers despite their positive views on the benefits of ICT in teaching. New teacher-graduates, meanwhile, experienced limitations on the opportunities to use ICT in teaching due to lack of facilities and available resources to carry out their learned competencies. They also expressed restraint to innovate teaching as they were aghast of the demands of 21st century education. The need to revitalize the teacher education curriculum is, therefore, proposed that should be highly responsive in gearing up the potentials of pre-service teachers on ICT-based teaching in the light of 21st century education.<p></p><strong>References</strong>Bender, W.
