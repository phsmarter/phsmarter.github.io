                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reading and writing skills are very essential. Reading and talking it out loud enhances our oral communication skills. It also helps in sharpening our minds because through reading we can expand our vocabulary. Reading helps us improve our language skills. It does not only enhances our comprehension skills, but also our ability to think and analyze things. When you are a good reader, it's easier for you to analyze things and do your work. Remember that when you read, you gain knowledge. And the knowledge you get is beneficial for you, whether you are writing your essays, being on a debate, doing your thesis, or even as simple as explaining things. When you read more you accumulate more words, and when you do, your writing skills develop as well. The more you read, the more you can formulate ideas on your mind. If you are a university student, writing skills are essential with all the projects and homeworks you do. If you are a worker, your writing skills are very essential with all the paper works whether memos, simple letter, and reports that you will do.

                            18. •What is the importance of free education for you? •What are the advantages and drawbacks of free education? •Does free education in college decrease the quality of education? •How free education will benefit our society? •What are your responsibilities as a student who uses free education?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The importance of free education for me is that it allows individuals to access higher education regardless of their socio-economic status. This can lead to increased opportunities for personal and professional growth and can help to reduce inequality within our society.</p><p></p><p>The advantages of free education include increased access to education for individuals who may not have been able to afford it otherwise, as well as the potential for a more educated and skilled workforce. Additionally, free education can help to reduce the burden of student debt and improve social mobility.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also drawbacks to free education. One potential disadvantage is that it may lead to overcrowding in classrooms and a decrease in the quality of education. Additionally, free education may put a strain on public funds and could result in a decrease in funding for other public services.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, free education in college does not necessarily decrease the quality of education. However, it is important for schools and universities to ensure that they have sufficient resources and support to provide high-quality education to all students.</p><p></p><p>Free education can benefit our society by increasing access to higher education and providing individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce. This can lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which can in turn drive economic growth and development.</p><p></p><p>As a student who uses free education, my responsibilities include making the most of the educational opportunities that are available to me and working hard to achieve my goals. I also have a responsibility to give back to my community and to use my education to make positive contributions to society.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Free education is extremely important to me because it allows me to pursue my educational goals without the financial burden of tuition. It gives me access to resources and opportunities that I may not otherwise have access to. </p><p></p><p>2. The advantages of free education include being able to access higher education without the financial burden of tuition, and the ability to gain knowledge and skills that can help lead to a successful career. The drawbacks could include overcrowding of classrooms and a decrease in the quality of education due to lack of proper funding. </p><p></p><p>3. No, free education in college does not necessarily decrease the quality of education. If a college or university is properly funded and staffed, free education can be just as effective as paid education. </p><p></p><p>4. Free education will benefit our society by improving access to higher education, which can help reduce poverty, increase job opportunities, and boost economic growth. It will also enable more people to pursue their career goals and enable them to become productive members of society. </p><p></p><p>5. As a student who uses free education, my responsibility is to take advantage of the resources available to me and to make the most of the educational opportunities. I must also be mindful of my academic performance and strive to do my best. Additionally,  I must ensure that I am making an effort to support the institutions that are providing me with a free education.</p><p></p><br />

                            21. In what school did Rizal wnroll to pursue his college education?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Primary Education</strong></p><p></p><p>Rizal first attended an all-boys private school in Biñan, Laguna from 1870 to 1871 under Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz. The Maestro’s nipa hut served as the school where Rizal mastered Latin and learned Spanish. Rizal’s great interest in the art made him a frequent visitor of the painter Juancho whose house was just near the school. The old painter gave Rizal free lessons in drawing and painting, and was impressed with the artistry of the young Pepe.</p><p></p><p><strong>Secondary Education</strong></p><p></p><p>Rizal was a fast learner, and had excelled under Maestro Justiniano. It was the Maestro who suggested to Jose’s parents that he be sent to Manila to pursue higher education. On June 10, 1872, four months after the execution of Gomburza, accompanied by Paciano, Jose went to Manila and took an entrance examination at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. But his father wanted a Jesuit college instead, and so Rizal tried at the Ateneo Municipal. Father Magin Ferrando, the college registrar, refused to admit Rizal for being overly late for the registration, and being sickly and too short for his age. Through the intercession of Manuel Xerez Burgos, Jose Burgos’ nephew, he was admitted at the Ateneo.</p><p></p><p>It was in Ateneo Municipal where the young Pepe first make used of the surname Rizal (from the Spanish word ricial, meaning green field or pasture) which was uniquely chosen by Don Francisco to avoid suspicions from the Spanish authorities of their relationship with the martyr, Burgos. Rizal was an excellent student and had garnered high scholastic records in all subjects. On March 23, 1877, the 15-year old Rizal received his Bachelor of Arts diploma (equivalent to present-day high school diploma), and was among the nine sobresaliente or outstanding students of their class.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tertiary Education</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>College<strong>)</strong></p><p></p><p>After finishing his studies in Ateneo, Rizal aimed to pursue a degree in a univerity. However, Doña Teodora had a premonition that Pepe’s life will be imperiled once he acquired too much knowledge. After a long discussion with family mebers, Don Francisco and Paciano finally convinced Doña Teodora to permit Rizal to enroll in a university. In April 1877, Rizal matriculated in the University of Santo Tomas and took Philosophy and Letters (1877-88) primarily because his father liked it, and he was still undecided on what career path to take. Rizal also took a surveying course in Ateneo. The following year, he shifted to Medicine which gave him grades that he found less remarkable than those he received from Ateneo. In UST, Rizal saw and experienced the rampant discrimination of Spaniards to Filipinos. One of which was from a Dominican priest who swore that he will never ever pass Rizal in any subject under him (although records show that Rizal did not receive any failing grades). This made Rizal decide to leave UST and pursue his medical course in Spain.</p><p></p><p><strong>Education Abroad</strong></p><p></p><p>Without prior consent from his parents and with the financial support from Paciano, Rizal traveled alone to Madrid, Spain on May 3, 1882 via the steamer, Salvadora, sailing to Singapore. On November 3, he enrolled in two courses – Medicine, and Philosophy and Letters – at the Universidad Central de Madrid. He also took lessons in painting and sculpture, and studied French, German and English languages under a private instructor in the Academy of San Carlos. He continued his passion for sports, practicing fencing and shooting in the Hall of Arms of Sanz y Carbonell in Madrid, as well.</p><p></p><p>On June 21, 1884, Jose Rizal completed his medical course and was awarded the degree of Licentiate in Medicine by the Universidad Central de Madrid. By the end of school year 1884-1885, he acquired the degree of Doctor of Medicine and received his degree of Licentiate in Philosophy and Letters on June 19, 1885 as sobresaliente.</p><p></p><p><strong>Early Education in Calamba and Biñan</strong></p><p></p><p>Rizal had his early education in Calamba and Biñan. It was a typical schooling that a son of an ilustrado family received during his time, characterized by the four R’s- reading, writing, arithmetic, and religion. Instruction was rigid and strict. Knowledge was forced into the minds of the pupils by means of the tedious memory method aided by the teacher’s whip. Despite the defects of the Spanish system of elementary education, Rizal was able to acquire the necessary instruction preparatory for college work in Manila. It may be said that Rizal, who was born a physical weakling, rose to become an intellectual giant not because of, but rather in spite of, the outmoded and backward system of instruction obtaining in the Philippines during the last decades of Spanish regime.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><br />

                        <p>The life, works, and writings of Dr. Jose Rizal are included in the college curriculum of all Philippine colleges <strong>with the explicit purpose of instilling nationalism in the Filipino student. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>If you ever set foot in college, chances are you’ve taken a whole class dedicated to Dr. Jose Rizal and his works. If not, then I’ll tell you what those classes usually involved. The class curriculum studies all the thinkpieces and literature Dr. Jose Rizal wrote in the topic of Filipino culture. These materials include: The Women of Malolos, El Filibusterismo, and Noli me Tangere.</p><p></p><p>The reason why this subject is included is because of <strong>Claro M. Recto. </strong>Recto fought for a bill to be passed requiring the subject of Rizal in colleges in the 1950s because he thought it was a way for the Philippines to revitalize the feeling of nationalism. He did it with strong opposition from the Catholic Church.</p><p></p><p>In Rizal’s writing the Catholic Church is often unapologetically criticized. In his books Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo we can infer that Rizal thought of the Catholic Church institutions as filled with hypocrites and an oppressing force in the liberation and progress of the Filipino society. As a matter of fact, when Antonio Morga, a Spanish lieutenant-general, thought of the Catholic Church as a saving institution and therefore making the Spanish colonization a holy duty Rizal refuted it by expressing his belief that Christianity is a colonizing tool.</p><p></p><p>By studying the life and works of Rizal, Recto hoped that the Filipino student can awaken in them the feeling of citizenship duties, discipline, loyalty to the nation, and above all cultivate a critical mind like Rizal have.</p><p></p><p>Just like Rizal, he hoped that we feel even a little bit of the love that Rizal had for the nation that was palpable in his writing. Though this purpose is noble, I hoped that the Filipino student is not blind to Rizal’s own biases and flaws in thinking. And rather than these biases and flaws being a proof that Rizal’s ideas are useless it is instead a further aid in reconstructing his life and the kind of era he lived in.</p><p></p><p>For more information on Rizal’s writings: https://brainly.ph/question/6181618</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
