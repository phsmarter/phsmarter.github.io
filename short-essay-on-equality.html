                                            On the LGBTQ+ Community and DiscriminationThe history of the LGBTQ+ community is complex, because society does not perceive bisexuals, gays, lesbians and transgenders as a norm. Despite the fact that according to the Declaration of Independence, “all men are created equal,” the LGBTQ+ community still has to struggle for real equality. There are various forms of LGBTQ+ discrimination. It varies from unfriendly attitude to such serious problems as the refusal to employ such an individual. As a result, many LGBTQ+ representatives are forced to live life, which they cannot control. It is obvious that discrimination is considered a permanent problem for those who belong to this community. However, its acceptance process observed during the last few years proves that the LGBTQ+ community will achieve real equality in the nearest future.It is possible to say that the LGBTQ+ community still has to struggle for its equal rights because not all people are ready to accept the fact that sexual diversity is a norm. It is also necessary to remember that things that are considered traditional in current society may become unacceptable in the future. That is why it is possible to state that the LGBTQ+ community has all chances to achieve equality in the nearest future and its members will receive an opportunity to live their life to the fullest. Different LGBTQ+ organizations do their best to bring awareness to the society about the issue of discrimination due to sexual orientation. LOGICAL ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS Directions: Rearrange correctly the sentences below to form a short argumentative essay.

Actually, successful people achieve their goals in life and work through effective and efficient decision making. The decision making process is usually guided by an individual’s beliefs, values, and attitudes as well concepts. While a person can use various concepts in making decisions, they should be very careful to select a concept that is effective and contributes to huge success. Nonetheless, these concepts exist to help an individual become a better decision maker in the world around him/her. Decision Making Concepts Resonating with Me: As previously mentioned, there are various decision making concepts that enable an individual to become a better decision maker in his/her daily life. One of these concepts that resonate with me as a decision maker is the WRAP model. WRAP model is a major concept because it enables a person to make his/her decisions through intentional illumination of strategic spots or points of consideration (Heath &amp; Heath, 2013, p.24). In this case, the decision is not made on the basis of what ordinarily comes to a person’s attention but through examining hidden corners or facts. WRAP model basically involves widening options, reality-test of assumptions, attaining distance before deciding, and preparing to be wrong. The widening of options primarily focuses on expanding the set of choices through identifying new options and analyzing them. This is followed by asking craftier questions in order to filter the information and collect trustworthy ones.

As individuals become increasingly aware of their biases, they begin to question and examine them through rational decision making process in order to alter or improve their behaviors by making better decisions. In conclusion, decision making is an important concept in everyday life because it is linked to success and effectiveness in various situations. This process is usually carried out based on various concepts and models such as WRAP model. The ability of an individual to make the most appropriate decision in a particular decision is based on his/her ability to choose the best possible concept or process for decision making. However, one should not be rigid when using a particular decision making model or concept.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Women should have the right to equal pay in the workplace for several reasons:</p><p></p><p>Fairness: Women should be paid the same amount as men for doing the same job. Paying women less than men for the same work is not only unfair, but it's also a violation of basic human rights.</p><p></p><p>Gender equality: Equal pay for women helps to promote gender equality in the workplace and society at large. When women are paid less than men, it reinforces the idea that women are worth less than men, which is simply not true.</p><p></p><p>Economic benefits: Paying women the same as men for the same work can have a positive impact on the economy. When women earn more money, they have more spending power, which can help to stimulate economic growth.</p><p></p><p>Talent retention: Providing equal pay to women can help to retain talented female employees in the workforce. If women are not paid fairly, they may choose to leave their jobs, which can result in a loss of valuable skills and experience.</p><p></p><p>Legal obligation: In many countries, it is a legal requirement to provide equal pay for men and women who perform the same job. This means that employers who fail to provide equal pay can face legal action and penalties.</p><br />

                            9. On the LGBTQ+ Community and DiscriminationThe history of the LGBTQ+ community is complex, because society does not perceive bisexuals, gays, lesbians and transgenders as a norm. Despite the fact that according to the Declaration of Independence, “all men are created equal,” the LGBTQ+ community still has to struggle for real equality. There are various forms of LGBTQ+ discrimination. It varies from unfriendly attitude to such serious problems as the refusal to employ such an individual. As a result, many LGBTQ+ representatives are forced to live life, which they cannot control. It is obvious that discrimination is considered a permanent problem for those who belong to this community. However, its acceptance process observed during the last few years proves that the LGBTQ+ community will achieve real equality in the nearest future.It is possible to say that the LGBTQ+ community still has to struggle for its equal rights because not all people are ready to accept the fact that sexual diversity is a norm. It is also necessary to remember that things that are considered traditional in current society may become unacceptable in the future. That is why it is possible to state that the LGBTQ+ community has all chances to achieve equality in the nearest future and its members will receive an opportunity to live their life to the fullest. Different LGBTQ+ organizations do their best to bring awareness to the society about the issue of discrimination due to sexual orientation. LOGICAL ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS Directions: Rearrange correctly the sentences below to form a short argumentative essay.

</strong><strong>On</strong><strong> </strong><strong>my</strong><strong> </strong><strong>side</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>equality</strong><strong>
