Many students describe him as a good teacher, and they learned a lot from him. “I really love to attend Mr. Santos’s class! He speaks English well, and he tells us many wonderful stories”, his students will say. However, other students see Mr. Santos as a strict and serious teacher. “Mr. Santos is a disciplinarian and he will not hesitate to correct your mistakes especially if you misbehaved in his class”, his students also say. a. BIASb. NOT BIAS2. Members of the Gen X are all workaholic! All they think about is work, work, and more work! They do not have time anymore for their families and friends. Worse, they do not even have time to take care of themselves. a. BIASb. NOT BIAS3. Many people nowadays enjoy eating avocado. The little green fruit is packed with vitamins and minerals which are good for one’s health. Avocados are also rich in fiber which is good for removing toxins in our large intestines. However, eating too much avocados can also lead to health problems like weight gain and even obesity. Other people may also experience having an upset stomach after eating too much avocado. Always remember that it is important to eat all kinds of food in moderation. a. BIASb. NOT BIAS4. Of all my subjects this year, English 8 is the best! No other subject is better than this subject.

Reading books is really a hard thing to do. It is also a very boring activity! That is why I cannot understand people who love reading books.

NOT BIASb. BIAS8.
