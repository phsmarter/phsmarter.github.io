                                            A soft drink company has recently received customer complaints about its one-liter-sized soft drink products. Customers have been claiming that the one-liter-sized products contain less than one liter of soft drink. The company has decided to investigate the problem. According to the company records, when there is no malfunctioning in the beverage dispensing unit, the bottles contain 1.01 liters of beverage on average, with a standard deviation of 0.16 liters. A sample of 50 bottles has been taken to be measured from the beverage dispensing lot. The mean amount of beverage in these 50 bottles was 0.995 liters. Find the probability of observing a sample mean of 0.995 liters or less in a sample of bottles, if the beverage dispensing unit functions properly.</a>

Without good service, few customers would return to any restaurant. A good server does more than just wait on customers. He or she is a salesperson. (Perhaps they should be called sellers, instead.) They should not just be taking orders and delivering food. They should be selling a product- your restaurant menu.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What Is Up-Selling?</p><p>A good server knows how to up-sell. Up-selling is simply getting a customer to spend more than he was originally intending. For example:</p><p></p><p>Customer: “I’ll have a martini, strait up.”</p><p>Server: “Do you have a preference on the gin? We carry Bombay and Beefeaters.”</p><p>Customer: “Beefeaters, please.”</p><p>The server did not take the drink order and walk away. Instead, she offered a more expensive liquor. If she hadn’t the customer would have bought a martini made with well gin. That’s fine, but a good server will always try to offer something a little nicer and a little bit more expensive. A restaurant may be classified as a food and beverage operation, but that doesn’t mean its employees shouldn’t employ salesperson tactics.</p><p></p><p>Chain restaurants, such as McDonald's, employ up-selling all the time. Whenever the person working the drive-through asks if you want to super-size your number seven, or if you want the extra hash brown for thirty cents, that is up-selling in its most basic and unrefined form.</p><p></p><p>Up-Selling Basics</p><p>In a restaurant, up-selling should be done with a little more finesse. The key to up-selling is to do it in a way that the customer doesn’t know he or she is being sold something. </p><br />

                            8.  3. How would you rate food and beverage business industry in the country now? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>can you put ma ball in you jaw</p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Forecast</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>demand</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>best</strong> <strong>ability</strong></p><p></p><p>Do not rely on current year sales as indicators, especially starting March 2020 – they are an anomaly.  Perform some research in estimating the growth. For example, leveraging information from Statista, it becomes abundantly clear how much demand in the food and beverage sector has grown in the last month.</p><p></p><p>Consumers have bought considerably more amounts of edible groceries, especially packaged food, alcohol, and beverages. In terms of food and beverages, purchases of vegetarian and vegan items rose the most: sales of oat milk grew by 347% while meat alternative sales grew by just over 200%. Sales of non-perishable foods in particular have surged in March. Ultimately, food and beverage sales are up across the board.</p><p></p><p>Take prior year monthly sales and apply the researched growth rate to the next few months. Incorporate the expected surge in demand if your business in the relevant category. However, consider a possibility of demand slowing if COVID-19 prolongs and shelter in place will become the “new normal.” Plan by week, month and quarter. Incorporate consumption rates into your calculations, and forecast an anticipated dip in demand once the consumer stocks up on the product, assuming low consumption rate exists. Plan for the dip in demand and plan for leveling out of the demand over time.</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>For</strong> <strong>young</strong> <strong>brands</strong>, <strong>consider</strong> <strong>alternative</strong> <strong>methods</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>introducing</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>brand</strong></p><p></p><p>Looking to launch or promote a brand is already challenging enough, and now traditional methods of promotion are no longer available. For example, young brands no longer have the option to offer samples in stores.</p><p></p><p>So now is the time to be creative and consider alternative methods of getting your product in front of potential consumers. One idea is to sample and distribute your product to hospitals and other places on the front lines of the crisis. Not only will you get your brand and product in front of people, but your act of good faith will make you a company to remember. In addition, invest time in branding online as further discussed below.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Lower</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>trade</strong> <strong>spend</strong></p><p></p><p>Industry experts recommend that brands cease or postpone promotions for the next three months. There is not enough supply at any link of the supply chain, most importantly there are currently widespread out-of-stocks at-shelf.</p><p></p><p>By reducing promotions, you will eliminate promotionally driven spikes in volume which the supply chain cannot handle.</p><p></p><p>In addition, removing promotions will help steady the flow of inventory with an aim at improving in-stock rate throughout the supply chain. Therefore, a temporary hold on promotions can preserve the trade budget for redeployment once things settle down.</p><p></p><p>Some retailers are already reducing promotional activity as is. Failing to do so may increase the likelihood of out-of-stock conditions on the shelf and cause surges in purchasing during promotional activity thereby lowering ROIs.</p><p></p><p>However, one thing to note before you cease promotional activities is that there may be certain restrictions in place. For example, some distributors recently issued a statement requiring notice of at least 90 days prior to pulling promotions. It is important to use your data and track the information.</p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Attempt</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>increase</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>market</strong> <strong>share</strong> <strong>now</strong></p><p></p><p>Companies typically increase their market share through a number of different ways, like innovation, strengthening customer relationships, smart hiring practices and acquiring competitors. However, right now, your biggest tool to increase your market share is developing a unique brand position, which will involve spending marketing dollars.</p><p></p><p>This may sound counterintuitive, but capturing market share when the market is on the decline will produce significant ROI when the market recovers. Experts don’t recommend spending money on innovation in this stage; instead, focus on your best products and see how you can enhance their position in the marketplace. </p><p></p><p>Also, review your marketing strategies on social media. Remember at a time like this, people are spending even more time in front of screens – whether that be their social media applications, television, the Internet or streaming services.</p><p></p><p>If you are able to make your company more visible on a digital screen, now seems like the time to do so. It is also important to structure your offering and any related advertising with a sense of empathy for the ongoing crisis. Focus on how your products can help during the pandemic. This might mean pivoting your current strategy.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>These lines can lead to higher check averages and greater guest satisfaction.  Servers can also expect higher tips if these scripts are practiced to perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Tonight I'm Featuring..."</p><p></p><p>This is a soft and non-intimidating opening line that piques a guest's interest and curiosity. A good example is:</p><p></p><p>"Tonight I'm featuring O'Douls Amber non-alcoholic beer, which goes perfectly with the Club House BLT."</p><p></p><p>Guests may ask what "I'm featuring..." means. Servers can explain that they like to share the best combinations of food and beverages–those that have become popular among the staff and other guests. One in five guests will say, "Sounds good. I'll try it."</p><p></p><p>"May I Recommend..."</p><p></p><p>Once servers have established a relationship with their guests, they're in a perfect position to offer their own recommendations. Suggestions based on personal preferences always carry great credibility. A good example is:</p><p></p><p>"May I recommend the fresh baked Chocolate Amaretto Cream Pie with a frothy cappuccino? It's one of my favorites."</p><p></p><p>"Try Means Buy..."</p><p></p><p>Many guests are reluctant to experiment with unfamiliar menu items. Encourage your servers to recommend dishes that guests haven't ordered before. For example:</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever tried our special herbal tea with the bread pudding? It's our special house blend, and it's a great flavor combination!"</p><p></p><p>Practice makes perfect. Role-playing during your pre-shift briefing will help servers act naturally—without an obvious hard-sell attitude. The payoff will come in higher check averages and greater guest satisfaction. And the servers will make higher tips, too!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope i gave the answer true </p><br />

                            26. Sampling method about impact of drinking alcoholic beverages  to senior high school​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The harmful use of alcohol is the leading risk factor for death among men aged 15–59 years, and road traffic accidents rank second on global alcohol-attributable deaths [1]. In Brazil, traffic crashes (TC) caused 38,737 fatal victims in 2008 [2], and a few studies conducted in the country indicate that between 30–50% of these victims had a positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC) [3], [4]. Despite such disquieting figures, victims of TC are not systematically examined with the help of breathalyzers, rendering the report of non-fatal accidents associated with the misuse of alcohol probably underestimated. As of June 2008, a zero tolerance law was adopted in the country aiming at minimizing these figures and curbing driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). However, much has still to be done in terms of a comprehensive enforcement of such legislation in Brazil, as has been implemented in affluent countries [1], [5], [6]. Enforcement through random breath testing and sobriety checkpoints has been erratically implemented across the different Brazilian regions and localities and remains a formidable challenge in a continental-sized and deeply heterogeneous country.Alcohol availability remains high in Brazil [7], [8]. The government does not control alcohol sales and distribution through sanctioned licensing systems or monopolies, and any commercial establishment linked to food distribution or adult entertainment may sell alcoholic beverages at its discretion. Also, there are no restrictions in terms of the density of outlets and/or their operation (e.g. days and hours they may remain open), which could help reduce the number of accidents and related fatalities [9], [10]. Literature already indicates that consuming alcoholic beverages in places like bars and restaurants (alcohol outlets with consumption on-premises) increases the chance for DUI [11], [12], and the association of AO density and traffic crashes (TC) is under study worldwide [13]–[15]. A comprehensive assessment of this association is key, since the allocation and availability of such outlets can and should be part of public policies aiming at reducing alcohol-related harms. However, studies targeting a representative sample of people who purchase and consume alcoholic beverages on the premises and then drive are extremely rare due to the difficulties to define a valid sampling frame for this mobile population.<p></p>Most studies have used indirect estimation methods and/or are ecological, in the sense that individual-level data are usually not collected through face-to-face interviews on AO: some studies use telephone-based surveys [16], others obtain data from places where major harms associated with immoderate consumption are reported, such as emergency rooms [17], and analyses typically consider data aggregated at different levels, such as neighborhoods [18], counties [19], or states [20]. Recent studies have been using sophisticated methods, e.g. the portal survey methodology, in the assessment of alcohol and alcohol-related harms in context. Notwithstanding these improvements, the external validity of such methods remains far from optimal [21]–[23].<p></p><strong>Different sampling methods </strong>have been used for the sake of better estimating alcohol and drug using patterns, as well as their harmful consequences. Some of these methods are based on the structure and dynamic of networks, such as the classic snowball sampling [24] and more recently respondent-driven sampling [25], [26]. The main limitation of such methods refers to the difficulty to obtain population-based estimates, due to a variety of biases and bottlenecks [27]. Another limitation is due to the fact that methods such as classic snowball or respondent-driven sampling correspond, after Valente’s typology, to “sequenced data”, i.e. networks that are situated in between egocentric or “local networks” and “complete network data”. The latter corresponds to comprehensive assessments of a given community, using either a census or a quasi-census (saturation) approach [28].<p></p><strong>Time location/space sampling (TLS)</strong> has also been used to assess and sample hard-to-reach populations [29]–[31]. In this venue-based kind of study sampling strategies usually comprise two or three steps [32]: places are randomly selected (usually after preliminary mapping), then days and periods of time people could and should be interviewed in the different scenes, then individuals, selected with systematic sampling. Although considered as a probability-based method, the accurate and precise estimation of individuals comprising this third step is not always possible. Such limitations and caveats can be properly addressed through the use of carefully designed probability samples.<br />
