                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hi, my name is Leona. I'm currently 22 years old and I'm studying psychology right now. In the last two weeks, I've been taught how to treat a patient in psychotherapy through the lens of three different theories of psychodynamics: Freudian, Behaviorist, and Cognitive. It's been a very eye-opening experience that has helped me understand a lot more about myself and other people around me!</p><p></p><p>I've also recently found out that my uncle was diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this year. It's very difficult to cope with the idea that he's dying—especially because I'm still very young and this is my first experience witnessing death. However, I feel like a lot of my family members are trying to keep everything "positive" and "upbeat" now. My uncle doesn't seem to have his spirits as high as we would've liked, but it feels like there's a sort of unspoken rule that we shouldn't bring up anything about the fact that he might die soon.</p><p></p><p>I've noticed that my family and other relatives are especially afraid of talking about death directly. They don't like to bring up the subject, even if it's to talk about something positive, such as life insurance policies.</p><br />

She never sugarcoats anything and always tells me the truth even if it’s something I don’t want to hear. Her honesty has helped me grow as a person and I am grateful for that.</p><p></p><p>We have so many great memories together from road trips, sleepovers, concerts and even just hanging out at home. No matter what we do, we always have a great time together.</p><p></p><p>I believe that a true best friend is someone who is there for you through thick and thin, someone who you can trust and confide in, someone who is honest with you and someone who you have great memories with.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Grandparents</p><p>I was lucky enough to grow up in my grandparent’s house. Our family lived with my grandparents since I was little. As my paternal grandfather passed away when I was very young, I only remember a few memories of him. One thing I surely remember is he used to brush his teeth twice daily without fail. I adopted this habit and ever since I have been doing the same.</p><p></p><p>My maternal grandparents have been my true systems of support. I am lucky enough to have grown up around such inspirational people. My grandfather was a principal of a college, so he always emphasized the importance of education. He helped us with our homework when my parents were not available. I spent my vacations at their place as I enjoyed living with them.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, my grandparents always embraced me with open arms. They used to wait for every holiday for our arrival. My grandmother made delicious pickles and meals which we relished greatly. She taught me a few recipes too and tips and tricks that are very useful even today. I simply adore my grandparents for instilling good values in me and my parents and for giving us a safe space to grow up in.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Example of a Stressful Incident and Its Stages of Stress Response</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, I had a major project due for one of my courses in college. I had spent weeks researching and writing the paper, but as the deadline approached, I began to feel overwhelmed and anxious. On the day the paper was due, my computer crashed, and I lost all my progress. This incident triggered the three stages of the stress response: the alarm stage, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage.</p><p></p><p>The alarm stage is the first stage of the stress response. It is also known as the fight or flight response. When I realized that I had lost all my progress on the paper, my body went into a state of shock. My heart rate increased, and I began to sweat. My brain released hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which prepared me to either fight the problem or run away from it.</p><p></p><p>The resistance stage is the second stage of the stress response. It occurs when the stressor persists, and the body continues to respond to it. In my case, I had to decide what to do next. I could either give up on the project or start over. I chose to start over, which meant working long hours and sacrificing sleep and other activities. This stage is characterized by continued release of stress hormones, which can lead to physical and mental exhaustion if prolonged.</p><p></p><p>The exhaustion stage is the third and final stage of the stress response. It occurs when the body can no longer cope with the stressor, and it begins to break down. In my case, after weeks of stress and anxiety, I finally completed the project. However, I was physically and mentally exhausted. I had trouble sleeping, and I experienced headaches and other physical symptoms. This stage can lead to long-term health problems if not managed properly.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the three stages of the stress response – alarm, resistance, and exhaustion – are a natural and normal response to stressful situations. However, prolonged exposure to stress can lead to physical and mental health problems. In my case, the stress of the project caused me to experience physical symptoms and exhaustion. It is important to be aware of the stages of stress response and to take steps to manage stress effectively, such as through exercise, relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends or mental health professionals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>note: follow and mark me Brainliest for more answers </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Evolution of Life
</p><p>The diversity of life on Earth today is the result of evolution. Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since. At first, all living things on Earth were simple, single-celled organisms. Much later, the first multicellular organisms evolved, and after that, Earth’s biodiversity greatly increased. Figure below shows a timeline of the history of life on Earth. You can also find an interactive timeline of the history of life at the link
</p><p>
</p><p>Darwin and the Theory of Evolution
</p><p>The idea of evolution has been around for centuries. In fact, it goes all the way back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. However, evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin. Darwin published a book on evolution in 1859 titled On the Origin of Species. In the book, Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection. He also presented a great deal of evidence that evolution occurs.
</p><p>
</p><p>Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. As described by Darwin, evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural selection, some members of a species, being better adapted or suited to their environment, produce more offspring than others, so they pass "advantageous traits" to their offspring. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of the species. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment. This is because they evolve adaptations. An adaptation is a trait that helps an organism survive and reproduce in a given environment.
</p><p>
</p><p>Despite all the evidence Darwin presented, his theory was not well-received at first. Many people found it hard to accept the idea that humans had evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and they saw evolution as a challenge to their religious beliefs. Look at the cartoon in Figure below. Drawn in 1871, it depicts Darwin himself as an ape. The cartoon reflects how many people felt about Darwin and his theory during his own time. Darwin had actually expected this type of reaction to his theory and had waited a long time before publishing his book for this reason. It was only when another scientist, named Alfred Russel Wallace, developed essentially the same theory of evolution that Darwin put his book into print.
</p><p>
</p><p>Charles Darwin’s name is linked with the theory of evolution. This cartoon from the 1870s makes fun of both Darwin and his theory.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although Darwin presented a great deal of evidence for evolution in his book, he was unable to explain how evolution occurs. That’s because he knew nothing about genes. As a result, he didn’t know how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, let alone how they could change over time.
</p><p>
</p><p>Evolutionary Theory After Darwin
</p><p>Since Darwin’s time, scientists have gathered even more evidence to support the theory of evolution. Some of the evidence comes from fossils, and some comes from studies that show how similar living things are to one another. By the 1930s, scientists had also learned about genes. As a result, they could finally explain how characteristics of organisms could pass from one generation to the next and change over time.
</p><p>
</p><p>Using modern technology, scientists can now directly compare the genes of living species. The more genes different species share in common, the more closely related the species are presumed to be. Consider humans and chimpanzees. They share about 98% of their genes. This means that they shared a common ancestor in the not-too-distant past. This is just one of many pieces of evidence that show we are part of the evolution of life on Earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>Misconceptions About Evolution
</p><p>Today, evolution is still questioned by some people. Often, people who disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it. For example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how life on Earth first began. In fact, the theory explains only how life changed after it first appeared. Some people think the theory of evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes. In fact, the theory suggests humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived several million years ago. These and other misconceptions about evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this fundamental principle of biology.
</p><p>
</p><p>Summary
</p><p>Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since.
</p><p>Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection, presenting a great deal of evidence to support his theory.
