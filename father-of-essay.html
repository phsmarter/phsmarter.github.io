                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Secret Bond</p><p>In today’s society, a loving father son relationship is foreseeable. However, in the past, father son bonds could’ve been seen as distant and uncaring relationships. In the 1930’s, men were tough, brave, and manly and did not show many signs of affection. “The Secret Heart,” a poem by Robert P. Tristam Coffin, clarifies a father son relationship in the 1930's. The poem is shown through a father who has a strict relationship with his son, but at night, while he believes his son asleep, he exhibits his love for his son when he is not aware. The author uses imagery, form, and metaphors to establish the hidden love between this father and his son.</p><p>Throughout “The Secret Heart,” Coffin holds different views of the poem using imagery.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>because he is our almighty father in heaven, he is our savior ,our strength. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In all things, God is our loving Father. He begat us, is nurturing us through the Holy Spirit, and is preparing us for our ultimate purpose. </p><p></p><p>We may sin, we may turn away, but God will never forsake us. He will always be there, loving us through everything we do. In much of modern Christianity, God is addressed as the Father, in part because of his active interest in human affairs, in the way that a father would take an interest in his children who are dependent on him and as a father, he will respond to humanity, his children, acting in their best interests.</p><p> “We love God because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). God is the first cause of all that is good and right in the world. Wherever and whenever love exists on earth, it only exists because it is a reflection of God's perfect love that created us and sustains us.</p><p></p><p>Psalm 103:13: "The Lord is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him." Proverbs 3:11-12: "My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline, and do not resent his rebuke, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in."</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Everyone has a mom and a dad, and most parents love their parents unconditionally; so in return kids should show honor towards their parents through love as well. In order to honor your mother and father, one must show respect, obedience, and especially honesty towards them. Everyone must be honest with their parents no matter how hard it is to be. The Bible and God demand honesty, especially towards your parents. In order to fully honor your parents you must also try to be completely honest with them. White lies are often told and thought of as no big deal, but after a while they will lead to bigger lies that could get people into serious trouble. Being honest with your parents is so important because your mother and father need to become fully involved with your life even if it is hard for you to let them. Your parents want to be a part of your lives, but without honesty they are unable to. Also, in order to be honest with your parents, you must also be honest with oneself. Honoring your mother and father is one of the most important things in life because it includes, respect, obedience, and honesty. One's parents need to receive great honor from their children because they love them with all of their hearts.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Social scientists study all aspects of society—from past events and achievements to human behavior and relationships among groups. Their research provides insights into the different ways individuals, groups, and institutions make decisions, exercise power, and respond to change. They look at data in detail, such as studying the data they've collected, reanalyzing already existing data, analyzing historical records and documents, and interpreting the effect of location on culture and other aspects of society. Through their studies and analyses, social scientists offer insight into the physical, social, and cultural development of humans, as well as the links between human activity and the environment. Following are brief discussions of several major types of social scientists. Specialists in one field may find that their research overlaps work being conducted in another discipline...</p><p></p><p>#SaLiK</p><br />

                            18. my father goes to court essayintroduction,body and conclusion​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The story is set in a city in the Philippines. The young narrator begins by describing his large family. Though they are poor they are full of mischief and laughter. The children are all strong and healthy even though they often go hungry. In contrast, their rich neighbor’s children are thin and sickly although they are given plenty of good food, which their impoverished neighbors enjoy smelling over the fence. Consequently, the rich man brings a charge against the narrator’s family for stealing the spirit of his family’s food.</strong></p><p><strong>The absurd case goes to court, and the narrator’s father agrees to pay back the rich neighbor. He does this by collecting coins from all his friends present in his hat, then shaking the hat full of coins. Being charged to pay for the spirit of food which his family supposedly got from its smell, he maintains that the jingling of the coins is a fair equivalent.</strong></p><p><strong>The judge rules in the poor father’s favor, and the rich man is forced to depart with no other payment than the “spirit” of the money the poor man collected. In the Filipino context, this story favors the underprivileged families over affluent ones. It is</strong></p><p><strong>supported by the part at the end of the story where after the father gave back the “spirit of wealth” through the jingling of the coins in the straw hat, the judge immediately dismissed the case. While it is not really true in this day and age because the poor has no fair fight against the rich, the idea behind it is not quite simple. Maybe the author wanted to show the issue the other way around, thus, using a reverse psychology.</strong></p><p><strong>Filipinos are known to be light people. We don’t usually wear much burden on our shoulders. Well, we have a lot but how do we cope with every situation? By not taking it so hard, of course! In every problem, like poverty, even if they don’t get to eat much for the day, they are still smiling and laughing together and the family is still intact. Like in the story, the narrator’s family is a poor family, and yet, because they are not so sensitive, they get to play outside and laugh. In the rich family’s case, they are abundant in food and a comfortable lifestyle but are still not content with what they have and push others-like the poor family- to pay for it. In the real world, rich people tend to step down on the poor because they perceive themselves more powerful than the poor.</strong></p><p><strong>In the part where the judge asked the father where his lawyer was, and he said he doesn’t need one, it is seen as the turning point of justice in the Philippines. The law dictates that every citizen is given justice. But is it really the case? The law takes for granted the poor.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If in case both parents, father and mother, are neglecting their duties and responsibilities as home keepers, the mentioned family will only dwell in the context of a house and not a home. Moreso, the children, if there's any, will be much more affected. Growing without their guidance, no model of good behavior and sense of responsibility would put them into big trouble someday. Also, imagine the mental impact it will bring to the children. The ideals of having a family will no longer be as exciting as it is. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Having an alcoholic father could be a nightmare to many. You face it day by day. What's hard about it, is the fact that you can't seem to stop him, for it already became an addiction. Being drunk here and there, day in and day out, troubles, fights, and it's even harder for it seems to get worse everyday. </p><p></p><p>It was really hard to face it day by day, but I choose to make it as an inspiration, a motivation. It made me learn to stand not just for myself but for my  mother, brothers and sisters. It made me work harder everyday. Seeing my father being drunk makes me wanna be a better person someday, better than he does. An alcoholic father made me a stronger person today, than I am before. It made me strong enough to pass through all the problems and hindrances that may come to my way.</p><p></p><p>A problem doesn't only bring negative effects, it could bring positive ones. It's just a matter of how you see it. It's your choice to make it as something that holds you back from achieving your goals, or to see it as something that makes you grow as a person.</p><p></p><p>**hope it helps**</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>"My Father Goes to Court" is a short story written by Carlos Bulosan, which is often studied as a piece of literature in English classes. It is not a conviction and belief essay in itself, but it does explore themes related to justice, prejudice, and personal conviction.</p><p></p><p>The story centers around the character of the narrator's father, who is a poor Filipino immigrant working in the United States. One day, the father is accused of stealing and is brought to court. Despite facing discrimination and injustice, the father maintains his innocence and stands up for himself in court, even if it means facing punishment.</p><p></p><p>Through the father's character, the story explores themes related to conviction and belief, particularly the idea of standing up for oneself and one's beliefs in the face of adversity. It also touches on themes related to cultural identity and the struggles faced by immigrants in the United States.</p><p></p><p>While "My Father Goes to Court" is not a conviction and belief essay in itself, it does offer a powerful example of how personal conviction and belief can influence one's actions and shape one's identity.</p><br />

                            30. 200 essay you are a teenager in the middle of a call with close friend.you mother or father call you to do a chore​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a teenager, it can be frustrating to be interrupted in the middle of a call with a close friend by a parent asking you to do a chore. On the one hand, you want to be respectful and responsive to your parents, but on the other hand, you don't want to lose the momentum of your conversation with your friend. In this situation, it is important to find a balance between these conflicting priorities.</p><p></p><p>One approach to this situation could be to briefly acknowledge your parent's request and let them know that you will get to the chore as soon as possible. For example, you could say something like, "Thanks for reminding me, Mom. I'll do that right after I finish my call with [friend's name]." This lets your parent know that you are aware of their request and that you plan to take care of it, but also indicates that you are currently engaged in a conversation and need a few more minutes to finish.</p><p></p><p>Another approach could be to ask your parent if the chore can wait until you finish your call with your friend. Depending on the nature of the chore and your parent's availability, they may be willing to let you finish your call before you start on the chore. This approach requires a bit more communication and negotiation, but it can be a good way to prioritize your social connections and show your parents that you value your friendships.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the approach you take in this situation will depend on your specific relationship with your parents and the nature of the chore they are asking you to do. The key is to find a balance between being respectful and responsive to your parents and maintaining your connections with your friends.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As a teenager, it can be frustrating when your parents interrupt your phone calls with friends to ask you to do a chore. However, it's important to remember that your parents are just trying to help you become responsible and independent. They may have asked you to do a chore because they believe it will teach you valuable life skills or help you become more organized and self-sufficient.</p><p></p><p>When your parent calls you to do a chore, it's important to be respectful and follow their instructions. This can be difficult, especially if you're in the middle of a fun conversation with a friend, but it's important to show your parents that you appreciate their guidance and are willing to help out around the house.</p><p></p><p>One way to handle this situation is to let your friend know that your parent has asked you to do a chore, and that you'll need to end the call in order to complete it. You can apologize to your friend and let them know that you'll call them back as soon as you're finished with the chore. This will show your friend that you value their friendship, but that you also respect your parents and their rules.</p><p></p><p>Once you've ended the call with your friend, focus on completing the chore as quickly and efficiently as possible. This will show your parents that you're capable of taking on responsibilities, and that you're willing to contribute to the household. It may also help to thank your parents for asking you to do the chore, and to let them know that you appreciate their guidance and support.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it can be frustrating when your parents interrupt your phone calls with friends to ask you to do a chore. However, it's important to be respectful and follow their instructions in order to show them that you appreciate their guidance and are willing to help out around the house. By doing this, you'll be able to maintain good relationships with both your parents and your friends.</p><p></p><br />
