What ideal state of governance could be inferred from the selection?the storyBook XVI. Ke SheChapter I.1. The head of the Chi family was going to attack Chwan-yu.2. Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chi, is going tocommence operations against Chwan-yu."3. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here?4. "Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over thesacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; and itsruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do withattacking it?5. Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.6. Confucius said, "Ch iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, "When he can put forth his abilty,he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retiresfrom it. how can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen? "And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when atortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?"8. Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief does not now takeit, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants."9. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, the superior man hates that declining to say"I want such and such a thing." and framing explanations for the conduct.10. "I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.11. "So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, theymust be made contented and tranquil.12. "Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory, there are divisions anddownfalls, leavings and separations, and, wilh your help, he cannot preserve it.13. "And yet, he is planning these hostile movements within the State.-I am afraid that the sorrow bof the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen oftheir own court."Chapter II.1. Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitivemilitary expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire,ceremonies, musiC, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these thingsproceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power inten generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the princes, as a rule, the cases willbe few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers ofthe great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in whichthey do not lose their power in three generations.4. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the Greatofficers.3. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the commonpeople."Book XVIII. Wei TszeChapter I1. The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pkan remonstrated with him and died.2. Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue"Chapter IIHui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Someone said to him "Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this" he replied, "Serving men in an upright waywhere shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? if choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?Source: James Legge (translator), The Chinese Classics, volume 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893​</a>

                                            Using celebrities in advertising dates back to the late nineteenth century, and this common advertising practice has drawn a considerate amount of academic and practical attention (see Erdogan 1999 for an extensive review). Most academic investigations of celebrity endorsement have been contextualized in the realm of source credibility and attractiveness models, and suggest that celebrities exert their influence on consumers through perceived attributes such as expertise. trustworthiness, attractiveness, familiarity and likeability (Ohanian 1990, 1991). Another stream of research on celebrity endorsement, which is labeled the "match-up hypothesis." has examined the fit or match between a celebrity and the product being endorsed, and maintains that celebrity endorsement is more effective when the images or characteristics of the celebrity are well matched with the endorsed products (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990; Kamins and Gupta 1994; Till and Busier 2000). In similar vein, McCracken suggests that a "celebrity who best represents the appropriate symbolic properties" of the product should be selected, thus highlighting the importance of the cultural meanings of the celebrities in the endorsement process. Celebrities embody a collection of culturally relevant images, symbols, and values. As images of the celebrities become associated with products through endorsement, the meanings they attach to the products are transferred to consumers through purchase and consumption (McCracken 1989, 316). Therefore, the practice of celebrity endorsement should be closely related to the cultural context in which the images of celebrities are formed and individual celebrities are selected to be linked with particular products. For advertising practitioners, employing an appropriate celebrity endorser to promote a product is important but a difficult task. For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.

                                            Using celebrities in advertising dates back to the late nineteenth century, and this common advertising practice has drawn a considerate amount of academic and practical attention (see Erdogan 1999 for an extensive review). Most academic investigations of celebrity endorsement have been contextualized in the realm of source credibility and attractiveness models, and suggest that celebrities exert their influence on consumers through perceived attributes such as expertise. trustworthiness, attractiveness, familiarity and likeability (Ohanian 1990, 1991). Another stream of research on celebrity endorsement, which is labeled the "match-up hypothesis." has examined the fit or match between a celebrity and the product being endorsed, and maintains that celebrity endorsement is more effective when the images or characteristics of the celebrity are well matched with the endorsed products (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990; Kamins and Gupta 1994; Till and Busier 2000). In similar vein, McCracken suggests that a "celebrity who best represents the appropriate symbolic properties" of the product should be selected, thus highlighting the importance of the cultural meanings of the celebrities in the endorsement process. Celebrities embody a collection of culturally relevant images, symbols, and values. As images of the celebrities become associated with products through endorsement, the meanings they attach to the products are transferred to consumers through purchase and consumption (McCracken 1989, 316). Therefore, the practice of celebrity endorsement should be closely related to the cultural context in which the images of celebrities are formed and individual celebrities are selected to be linked with particular products. For advertising practitioners, employing an appropriate celebrity endorser to promote a product is important but a difficult task. For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.

The way they treat you should be your number one consideration.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. yes.

The last paragraph mentions a principle that people should seek their own place and origin within the society, what does this mean? 6. What ideal state of governance could be inferred from the selection?the storyBook XVI. Ke SheChapter I.1. The head of the Chi family was going to attack Chwan-yu.2. Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chi, is going tocommence operations against Chwan-yu."3. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here?4. "Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over thesacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; and itsruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do withattacking it?5. Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.6. Confucius said, "Ch iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, "When he can put forth his abilty,he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retiresfrom it. how can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen? "And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when atortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?"8. Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief does not now takeit, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants."9. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, the superior man hates that declining to say"I want such and such a thing." and framing explanations for the conduct.10. "I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.11. "So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, theymust be made contented and tranquil.12. "Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory, there are divisions anddownfalls, leavings and separations, and, wilh your help, he cannot preserve it.13. "And yet, he is planning these hostile movements within the State.-I am afraid that the sorrow bof the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen oftheir own court."Chapter II.1. Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitivemilitary expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire,ceremonies, musiC, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these thingsproceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power inten generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the princes, as a rule, the cases willbe few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers ofthe great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in whichthey do not lose their power in three generations.4. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the Greatofficers.3. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the commonpeople."Book XVIII. Wei TszeChapter I1. The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pkan remonstrated with him and died.2. Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue"Chapter IIHui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Someone said to him "Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this" he replied, "Serving men in an upright waywhere shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? if choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?Source: James Legge (translator), The Chinese Classics, volume 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Rulers of the state and chiefs of families are most troubled about maintaining order and keeping their people in their designated places within society. They are concerned with ensuring that the people are content and at peace, rather than worried about poverty or the number of people in their society.</p><p></p><p>The state should satisfy the people by ensuring that they are content in their designated places within society and by promoting harmony and order. It should also cultivate virtues and civil culture to attract and subdue any unruly or rebellious people.</p><p></p><p>The principle mentioned in the last paragraph is that people should strive to fulfill their designated roles within society and not try to rise above their place or seek power that is not rightfully theirs. This means that people should be content with their position and not try to disrupt the social order.</p><p></p><p>The ideal state of governance inferred from the selection is one where the rulers are concerned with the contentment and well-being of the people, and where the people fulfill their designated roles within society. This state is characterized by harmony, order, and virtue, and is governed by principles of justice and fairness.</p><br />

                            16. Using celebrities in advertising dates back to the late nineteenth century, and this common advertising practice has drawn a considerate amount of academic and practical attention (see Erdogan 1999 for an extensive review). Most academic investigations of celebrity endorsement have been contextualized in the realm of source credibility and attractiveness models, and suggest that celebrities exert their influence on consumers through perceived attributes such as expertise. trustworthiness, attractiveness, familiarity and likeability (Ohanian 1990, 1991). Another stream of research on celebrity endorsement, which is labeled the "match-up hypothesis." has examined the fit or match between a celebrity and the product being endorsed, and maintains that celebrity endorsement is more effective when the images or characteristics of the celebrity are well matched with the endorsed products (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990; Kamins and Gupta 1994; Till and Busier 2000). In similar vein, McCracken suggests that a "celebrity who best represents the appropriate symbolic properties" of the product should be selected, thus highlighting the importance of the cultural meanings of the celebrities in the endorsement process. Celebrities embody a collection of culturally relevant images, symbols, and values. As images of the celebrities become associated with products through endorsement, the meanings they attach to the products are transferred to consumers through purchase and consumption (McCracken 1989, 316). Therefore, the practice of celebrity endorsement should be closely related to the cultural context in which the images of celebrities are formed and individual celebrities are selected to be linked with particular products. For advertising practitioners, employing an appropriate celebrity endorser to promote a product is important but a difficult task. For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.

                            19. Using celebrities in advertising dates back to the late nineteenth century, and this common advertising practice has drawn a considerate amount of academic and practical attention (see Erdogan 1999 for an extensive review). Most academic investigations of celebrity endorsement have been contextualized in the realm of source credibility and attractiveness models, and suggest that celebrities exert their influence on consumers through perceived attributes such as expertise. trustworthiness, attractiveness, familiarity and likeability (Ohanian 1990, 1991). Another stream of research on celebrity endorsement, which is labeled the "match-up hypothesis." has examined the fit or match between a celebrity and the product being endorsed, and maintains that celebrity endorsement is more effective when the images or characteristics of the celebrity are well matched with the endorsed products (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990; Kamins and Gupta 1994; Till and Busier 2000). In similar vein, McCracken suggests that a "celebrity who best represents the appropriate symbolic properties" of the product should be selected, thus highlighting the importance of the cultural meanings of the celebrities in the endorsement process. Celebrities embody a collection of culturally relevant images, symbols, and values. As images of the celebrities become associated with products through endorsement, the meanings they attach to the products are transferred to consumers through purchase and consumption (McCracken 1989, 316). Therefore, the practice of celebrity endorsement should be closely related to the cultural context in which the images of celebrities are formed and individual celebrities are selected to be linked with particular products. For advertising practitioners, employing an appropriate celebrity endorser to promote a product is important but a difficult task. For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.
