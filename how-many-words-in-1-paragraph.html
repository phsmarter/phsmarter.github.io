                                             ROCKS FROM OUTER SPACE The pieces of rocks that come from outer space have three names: meteor, meteorite, and meteoroid. A meteoroid is a piece of matter moving in space. It moves as fast as 40 miles a second. It may be large or small. Most meteoroids are smaller than a grain of sand. As a meteoroid comes into the air near the earth, it catches fire. Most meteoroids burn up before they hit the earth. The flash of light from the burning meteoroid is called a meteor. If a piece of meteoroid falls to the ground, it is called a meteorite. People have studied these rocks for many years. They wanted to research ways to keep meteoroids from making holes in spacecraft. Thick walls may help. Or perhaps the spacecraft can be covered with a metal skin that will seal itself. I. Word Text Test 1. How many words are there in the title of the passage?  2.

Both can help enhance one's vocabulary, too. They can be found in the library. The words in these books are presented and listed alphabetically. 11. In communication, one's vocabulary is important. Books can help us. Among these are the dictionary and thesaurus. The two are alike in a few ways and different in many others. 12. Indeed, these books can be relied on in improving one's vocabulary to achieve good communication skills. 13. However, the two books also differ. Dictionary contains information about words- what they mean, how they are pronounced, how they are used, and how they are broken down into syllables. On the other hand, thesaurus contains synonyms and antonyms of words. It enriches one's vocabulary.14. (15-16) (17-18) (19-20) (21-23) 120.251help pls​</a>

                                            DIVING Humans do not have the capacity to breathe underwater unaided by external devices. A diver who wants to stay underwater for more than a few minutes must breathe air from a special mixture of gases. He can wear diving suits and have air pumped to him from above or he can carry tanks of air on his back and breathe through a hose and a mouthpiece. Early divers discovered that it is not enough to supply air to breathe comfortably underwater. The diver's body is under great pressure in deep water because water weighs 800 times as much as air. Tons of water push against the diver deep in the sea. When this happens, his blood takes in some of the gases he breathes. When the diver rises to the surface, the water pressure becomes less. If he rises too quickly, the gases in his blood form bubbles that make breathing difficult. He suffers from bends, causing him to double up in pain. I. Word Text Test 1.

                            12.  ROCKS FROM OUTER SPACE The pieces of rocks that come from outer space have three names: meteor, meteorite, and meteoroid. A meteoroid is a piece of matter moving in space. It moves as fast as 40 miles a second. It may be large or small. Most meteoroids are smaller than a grain of sand. As a meteoroid comes into the air near the earth, it catches fire. Most meteoroids burn up before they hit the earth. The flash of light from the burning meteoroid is called a meteor. If a piece of meteoroid falls to the ground, it is called a meteorite. People have studied these rocks for many years. They wanted to research ways to keep meteoroids from making holes in spacecraft. Thick walls may help. Or perhaps the spacecraft can be covered with a metal skin that will seal itself. I. Word Text Test 1. How many words are there in the title of the passage?  2.

Both can help enhance one's vocabulary, too. They can be found in the library. The words in these books are presented and listed alphabetically. 11. In communication, one's vocabulary is important. Books can help us. Among these are the dictionary and thesaurus. The two are alike in a few ways and different in many others. 12. Indeed, these books can be relied on in improving one's vocabulary to achieve good communication skills. 13. However, the two books also differ. Dictionary contains information about words- what they mean, how they are pronounced, how they are used, and how they are broken down into syllables. On the other hand, thesaurus contains synonyms and antonyms of words. It enriches one's vocabulary.14. (15-16) (17-18) (19-20) (21-23) 120.251help pls​</h2><br />

                            26. DIVING Humans do not have the capacity to breathe underwater unaided by external devices. A diver who wants to stay underwater for more than a few minutes must breathe air from a special mixture of gases. He can wear diving suits and have air pumped to him from above or he can carry tanks of air on his back and breathe through a hose and a mouthpiece. Early divers discovered that it is not enough to supply air to breathe comfortably underwater. The diver's body is under great pressure in deep water because water weighs 800 times as much as air. Tons of water push against the diver deep in the sea. When this happens, his blood takes in some of the gases he breathes. When the diver rises to the surface, the water pressure becomes less. If he rises too quickly, the gases in his blood form bubbles that make breathing difficult. He suffers from bends, causing him to double up in pain. I. Word Text Test 1.
