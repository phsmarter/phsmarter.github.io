The comparison of the lexical and grammatical patterns and their appropriateness in academic writing is illustrated with the help of Word Smith tool 3. Students are often required to summarize scholarly journal articles or to base reviews or critiques or research papers on scholarly sources, all of which require acts of summary. Summary is one of the most prominent features of academic writing because it gives writers access to the ides of others. You will find the most of the academic writing you do will respond to or be based on the ideas the writing- of others​</a>

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

10. MANILA, Philippines—San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped theTropang Giga’s perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20-7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. “This is a big game for us and I’m thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there,” said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to4-2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.

Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort. When the fateful plane crash took the life of my husband. Jesse, it turned my whole world and those of my children upside down But the way the nation grieved with us and the impact of the legacy Jesse left behind plucked me out of the shadows I realized that there are things greater than ourselves and that there are causes that will always be worth fighting for no matter Ilamed that shing back into our bubbles, allowing fear and get to paralyze us only leads in deeper despair.

That every food pack eases a bit of the burden on families who have lost their incomes. That every protective equipment aut makes a medical front-liner foul safer. That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals.

                                            Let’s Try Directions: Read the paragraph carefully. Afterward, answer the following questions. Why a can of soda explodes if left outside on a hot sunny day A can of soda explodes when left in the sot sun because the pressure of the can increases due to the increase in temperature, eventually making the can explode due to the pressure being too high. In the online simulation, the volume of the contained was kept constant to represent a can. Gas was pumped into the container until the pressure was 1.5 atm. When the temperature is increased to from 300k to 500k, the pressure to 2.9 atm increased. When the temperature increased from 500k to 900k, the pressure increased to 5.5atm from 2.9 atm. At 1050k, the container exploded and released the gas after the pressure built to over 6 atm. According to Gay- Lussac’s Law, when volume is held constant, as it was in the case of the soda can, pressure and temperature are directly proportional. This means as temperature increases, pressure increases, and when temperature decreases, pressure decreases. If a soda can left out in the hot sun, the temperature inside the can will continually increase, causing the kinetic energy to increase. This causes the particles to move faster and hit the walls more often., increasing the pressure. Over time the pressure continues to increase as the temperature increases, eventually reaching too high of a pressure causing the can to explode. Reasonable Risk-taking Part of my Philosophy is that a life worth living involves taking reasonable risks, whatever that may mean to a person. Without that openness, responsiveness, a person sees very little possibility for change and can sink into a rut of routines. I have known many who define themselves by their routines-and little else. These are the people an American educator spoke of when he said, “Many people should have written on their tombstones: “Died at 30, buried at 60.” How sad! I think that one of the most horrible feelings a person must have is to be on the deathbed, regretting the many things never tried, and many things done that cannot be undone. I live my life to minimize possibilities of regrets, as I hope you do. Did you ever see that Sandra Bullock movie 28 Days? She plays an alcoholic in a destructive relationship with a guy who wants only to have fun. A staff person at the clinic where she is sentences to spend 28 days for her rehab explained: “Insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over and expecting different results.” Maybe more people should watch that movie. The world may not go out of its way to help you-the world does not owe us fairness-but the world is there with more possibilities than most of us imagine. If we are responsible to ourselves- and response-able, we can continue growing in the directions that are good for us. We do not need to understand the future, which, after all, does not exist, has not yet been created A.

Because of this, I am doing all I can at Reavis to lay the groundwork for my success in college. Then, once I am in college, I will study and learn about all species of animals. Finally, will find happiness in my career at a veterinarian because when animals and my assistance, I know that I will be able to help them... 2 Abstract: The present paper focuses on identifying the most frequently used linguistic structures in research article abstracts written in English by medical doctors.

                            8. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

Many of you must feel robbed as we are al stuck in our homes forced to deal with at that is happening from a distance The pandemic has brought our lives to a halt like nothing else could competing to imagine our world anew. How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort.

That every palengke delivery made means that a market vendor and tricycle driver eam enough to put food on the table. This is how we can move forward + Furwant by regaining anchorage on amat, real things with real outcomes, ming one step after another as we strive to reach our goals.

                            17. Let’s Try Directions: Read the paragraph carefully. Afterward, answer the following questions. Why a can of soda explodes if left outside on a hot sunny day A can of soda explodes when left in the sot sun because the pressure of the can increases due to the increase in temperature, eventually making the can explode due to the pressure being too high. In the online simulation, the volume of the contained was kept constant to represent a can. Gas was pumped into the container until the pressure was 1.5 atm. When the temperature is increased to from 300k to 500k, the pressure to 2.9 atm increased. When the temperature increased from 500k to 900k, the pressure increased to 5.5atm from 2.9 atm. At 1050k, the container exploded and released the gas after the pressure built to over 6 atm. According to Gay- Lussac’s Law, when volume is held constant, as it was in the case of the soda can, pressure and temperature are directly proportional. This means as temperature increases, pressure increases, and when temperature decreases, pressure decreases. If a soda can left out in the hot sun, the temperature inside the can will continually increase, causing the kinetic energy to increase. This causes the particles to move faster and hit the walls more often., increasing the pressure. Over time the pressure continues to increase as the temperature increases, eventually reaching too high of a pressure causing the can to explode. Reasonable Risk-taking Part of my Philosophy is that a life worth living involves taking reasonable risks, whatever that may mean to a person. Without that openness, responsiveness, a person sees very little possibility for change and can sink into a rut of routines. I have known many who define themselves by their routines-and little else. These are the people an American educator spoke of when he said, “Many people should have written on their tombstones: “Died at 30, buried at 60.” How sad! I think that one of the most horrible feelings a person must have is to be on the deathbed, regretting the many things never tried, and many things done that cannot be undone. I live my life to minimize possibilities of regrets, as I hope you do. Did you ever see that Sandra Bullock movie 28 Days? She plays an alcoholic in a destructive relationship with a guy who wants only to have fun. A staff person at the clinic where she is sentences to spend 28 days for her rehab explained: “Insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over and expecting different results.” Maybe more people should watch that movie. The world may not go out of its way to help you-the world does not owe us fairness-but the world is there with more possibilities than most of us imagine. If we are responsible to ourselves- and response-able, we can continue growing in the directions that are good for us. We do not need to understand the future, which, after all, does not exist, has not yet been created A.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1:An argument is a line of reasoning designed to prove a point. ... Regardless of length and complexity, all arguments have the same basic framework: the author states some central idea, and then presents supporting evidence, laying it out in a logical pattern. The central point of an argument is called the conclusion.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>b</p><p>Inquiry.</p><p>Conviction.</p><p>Persuasion.</p><p>Negotiation.</p><p>Primarily, argument has two purposes: argument is used to change people's points of view or persuade them to accept new points of view; and argument is used to persuade people to a particular action or new behavior.</p><br />
