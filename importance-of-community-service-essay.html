                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>       Effectiveness, financial security, equity, and responsiveness are all important goals of health systems and, by extension, health services. Evidence from high-income countries suggests that school health services have the potential to perform well across a range of health-system objectives.</p><p> </p><p>        School health services are available to families and are available where the majority of adolescents are. They overcome obstacles such as transportation, inconvenient locations, and appointment systems. They have the ability to influence multiple health determinants, such as public health interventions and environmental change strategies.</p><p>        There is some evidence, mostly from high-income countries, that school health services are effective, particularly for sexual and reproductive health, obesity and physical activity improvements, self-care among youth with chronic health conditions such as asthma or diabetes, smoking cessation, and the prevention and management of infectious disease among adolescents through immunizations.</p><p></p><p>       They are completely free at the point of use. Services appear to have cost benefits in terms of adolescent health and society as a whole by reducing health disparities and secondary care facility attendance.   They are highly valued by students, parents, and communities, and they can serve as conduits between schools and communities</p><p>    </p><p>       School health services manage CHCs in a safe and effective manner, often for students who have limited access to health care. Students with CHCs who have direct access to school nursing and other health services, as well as disease-specific education, have better health and academic outcomes. Students perform better in school when they are emotionally and physically healthy, according to research. They miss fewer classes, are less likely to engage in risky or antisocial behavior, concentrate better, and perform better on tests.</p><p>        </p><p>( pa brainliest po )</p><br />
