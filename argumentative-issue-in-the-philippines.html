                            5. Your goal is to write an argumentative essay on the issue of COVID 19 Pandemic in the Philippines.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s recent COVID-19 article, he mused that “nations cohere and flourish on the belief that their institutions can foresee calamity, arrest its impact and restore stability.” More than giving a rush of blood to the head of anyone in power, this brings into front and center the role of politics in a disease process as complicated and transcendental as this pandemic. Apart from being an epidemiologic phenomenon that has caused a global death toll that can parallel if not surpass that of previous plagues of our civilization, COVID-19 had unraveled the powers of nations and their leaders—their strengths and flaws—as they try their best, following a contagion dynamic, to maintain equilibrium in their part of the world by containing the disease lest it spirals out of control and spread to other areas.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 was first reported in December last year as a mysterious respiratory illness afflicting seafood market workers in Wuhan, China. Next thing we knew, it had already spread rapidly to multiple countries and to date had ravaged the entire world with massive cases and deaths in its trail and immeasurable economic and social costs for our world to bear now and in generations to come. How did it start? Was it naturally occurring or intentionally released? Was there a delay in reporting? Was there a cover-up? What global cooperation strategies can be deployed? What nations will emerge victorious in the response? After this coronavirus pandemic, what superpower will change the world order? Which kind of politics will prevail? What will be the fate of global health governance? Which countries stand to gain? How will health systems be transformed? How will people benefit from changes in the global health security movement?</p><p></p><p>These are questions that can frame our understanding of politosomatics which explores the links between politics and pandemics. As Mika Aaltola theorized, a “dis-ease” at the individual somatic body may be viewed as part of a bigger movement in the global political hierarchy. From the deadly Spanish Flu (H1N1) pandemic in 1918 to the hyped-up (because it proved benign later) Swine Flu (also H1N1) pandemic in 2009 to the coronavirus disease of today, pandemics albeit invisible enemies are real, tangible and personal. Individuals and societies are often gripped by their resultant fear, distress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>The old and new worlds of the East and West with their differing levels of economy and health system capacities, nuance of ideologies and culture, mix of fear, paranoia and indifference became good staging grounds for pandemics. This “coming plague” storyline started in the 1990s when Avian Flu was all the rage. Initially a disease of wild birds in China that threatened the poultry industry, human practices with livestock and mutation allowed the Avian Flu virus to jump from animals to humans and the thought of migratory birds flying to many destinations and spreading the disease propagated a medico-security paradigm that looks at external health threats as an important security issue of any country.</p><p></p><p>The “yellow danger” biohazard sign to mark unsafe sites couldn’t be more straightforward. This started the whole containment drama and military-inspired bio-preparedness tactics (think of Outbreak the movie) to mitigate the impacts of infectious diseases. Although disproportionately impacting the food security sector, Avian Flu was enough to stir the health security discourse and trigger the pandemic fantasies of the world then. Until 2003, with the US-led war on terror gaining traction after the 9/11 attacks, the perfect disease storm, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) came about. Again, it started in China but the disease surprised the world when it rapidly spread to major hubs around the world because of global interconnectedness through air travel and superspreaders—infected people who could unknowingly but exponentially infect many others—causing major economic losses and social disruptions in no time. In one fell swoop, SARS met the definition of a pandemic being able to shut down modern life support systems.</p><p></p><p>These interweaving pandemic and politics stories underscore the need for individual countries, regardless of their positions and power in international politics, to develop capacities for preparedness and resilience to pandemics--the quintessential health threat to the world order.</p><p>This is at the core of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the global health security agenda.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines, if we are to benefit from, if not change, the new world order after coronavirus, should be strategic enough to use its political resources (and people) and work with global partners not only to respond to COVID-19 but also to do its role in shaping the future of global health security.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reducing the complexity of a woman to her body or equating her character to the way she dresses has been a damaging way to deny women their humanity and to victim-shame survivors of sexual assault and rape. In public schools, young girls across the country have been kicked out of proms and suspended from school for wearing clothing that was deemed too “revealing” and distracting, sometimes in light of overly rigid dress codes.  Unsurprisingly, the common targets of such policing tend to be women and it’s sadly only a microcosm of a larger culture in which women’s bodies and clothing choices are perpetually policed and shamed.</p><br />

                            13. 1.	Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of casino industry in the Philippines. Write and argumentative about your position on the issue.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pros</p><p></p><p>Increased tax revenue</p><p></p><p>The government in the Philippines is always looking for additional sources of tax revenue. However, these are often hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>An easy fix to this is to open more legal casinos. Legal casino tax revenue can increase the budget of a country by quite a lot. The more legal casinos there are the more tax money the government will see.</p><p></p><p>So the next time you hear a government official say how the Philippines need a tax reform or to tighten their belt, remind them that there is also a much simpler solution. They can encourage people to open more legal casinos.</p><p></p><p>Increased economic activity and more jobs</p><p></p><p>Opening legal casinos does not only increase tax revenue directly, but also indirectly. It does this by putting more money into the pockets of those who own and work in casinos. And the casino industry employs quite a lot of people.</p><p></p><p>Casinos also increase the cash flow in connected businesses that operate in or around them. This means that restaurants, bars, and dining areas also see a lot of windfall from legal gambling establishments.</p><p></p><p>All this money cannot stay in people’s pockets forever, of course, and has to go in the Philippine economy sooner or later. This means more money for small enterprises, individual business owners, and more money in tax revenue.</p><p></p><p>Reduces criminal activity</p><p></p><p>Casinos have gone a long way from the days when they were connected to the mob and were synonymous with criminal activity. These days, legal casinos are just like any other business and the people working there only want to earn a living for themselves and for their families.</p><p></p><p>What is more, when there are more legal casinos, the number of illegal ones decreases. As you can imagine, criminal activity is predominantly present in these illegal establishments. The less illegal casinos there are the less crime the Philippines will see.</p><p></p><p>More money for charity donations</p><p></p><p>You might be surprised to learn that the gambling industry has to give a portion of its revenue to charity, but that is indeed the case. Even when this is done on voluntary basis there is lots of discontent in the public if the gambling industry fails to meet the donation target.</p><p></p><p>Cons</p><p></p><p>The government cannot regulate all gambling venues</p><p></p><p>Land based regulators try hard to impose the law on all gambling establishments in the Philippines. However, that sometimes requires a lot of footwork and is not always practical.</p><p></p><p>Gambling venues with dubious credentials often spring up in remote parts of the Philippines that you will struggle to even get to. These are not legitimate casinos and often look exactly like you see them in films – lots of shady-looking people gambling illegally in dark and smoke-filled rooms.</p><p></p><p>Regulating these would require authorities to go to every village and close a gambling shop as a new one opens somewhere else. Obviously, this is not very practical and would cost the tax payer a lot of money.</p><p></p><p>Increase in problem gamblers</p><p></p><p>It is to be expected that once there are more casinos out there, there will also be more players who will visit them. And if there are more players that go into a casino, the higher the chances that some of them will be problem gamblers or will develop the problem later.</p><p></p><p>Experts are also suggesting an alternative view here. They say that it is obvious that there will be more problem gamblers in the first couple of years after a new casino opens. This is to be expected.</p><p></p><p>However, they also say that after that initial excitement surrounding the casino goes away, the number of problem gamblers decreases. This means that you can expect to see more people with a gambling problem frequent a casino in the first few years, but that number will likely decrease in the future</p><br />

Our Government and DOH staff and other front liners is already doing their very best to maintain the small amount of covid cases in Philippines. The transportation of covid vaccine is still on-going. The hospital staff who sacrifice their lives just to treat everyone, not minding the lack of sleep and tiredness. Also to our police men who always make sure that people who enter in a place, are safe and will not infect other people. And, the people who do the protocols. If we keep doing this, helping each other and fighting against covid-19. Surely, the Philippines will be covid-free.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines, there are currently over 2 million learners with disabilities enrolled in public and private schools across the country. These learners are entitled to special education services to help them succeed in their academic pursuits. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of special education services has been severely impacted, leading to a decline in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>One of the challenges facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is the lack of access to technology and the internet. With the implementation of distance learning, learners with disabilities who do not have access to the necessary technology and internet connection are at a disadvantage. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of learners with disabilities who are able to participate in online classes.</p><p></p><p>Another issue is the lack of training and resources for teachers who are tasked with providing special education services. Many teachers are not equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to provide effective online special education services. This has resulted in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities being compromised.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated the existing inequalities in the education system. Learners with disabilities from low-income families are particularly vulnerable, as they may not have access to the same resources and support as their peers from more affluent backgrounds. This further widens the gap in the quality of education between different groups of learners.</p><p></p><p>In light of these challenges, it is imperative that the government takes action to address the issues facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic. This includes providing learners with disabilities with the necessary technology and internet connection, as well as providing teachers with the training and resources they need to effectively deliver special education services online. Additionally, more support should be given to learners from low-income families to ensure that they are not left behind.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the pandemic has brought to light the challenges facing special education in the Philippines. It is crucial that the government takes action to address these challenges and ensure that learners with disabilities are not left behind. By providing the necessary support and resources, we can ensure that all learners have access to quality education, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Study hard,hope it help</p><br />

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected education globally, including special education. In the Philippines, where special education is still a developing field, the pandemic has highlighted the need for further improvements in the sector. Despite some positive developments, the state of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is still inadequate.</p><p></p><p>One positive development in the Philippines is the increased awareness and attention given to special education during the pandemic. The government has launched various initiatives, including the provision of assistive technology and online training for teachers to support students with special needs. Additionally, the Department of Education (DepEd) has released guidelines for distance learning for students with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>However, these initiatives fall short in addressing the needs of all students with special needs in the country. For instance, the provision of assistive technology has been limited and not enough to support all students with disabilities. Additionally, online training for teachers is not enough to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to support students with different learning needs.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exposed the already existing challenges in special education in the Philippines. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the government has failed to ensure that all children with disabilities have access to education. Many students with disabilities face barriers to enrollment, such as lack of transportation, inaccessible classrooms, and insufficient support services. The pandemic has only made these challenges more evident, with many students with disabilities unable to access distance learning materials and services.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some progress has been made in the field of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic, the state of special education is still inadequate. The government must do more to address the barriers to education faced by students with disabilities, including the provision of more assistive technology and support services, and the improvement of teacher training. Only then can students with special needs receive the education they deserve, even during these challenging times.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Oh my god, okay here's my opinion.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Many women have found themselves in this predicament, including young girls who should be enjoying their childhood. People are still blaming the women who were in these situations, which I find repulsive. They're simply being disrespectful and disregarding the women's feelings. Why do women have to cover their entire body just because men intend to do inappropriate things with it? Isn't it true that everyone should be able to wear anything they want? Instead of forcing women to wear baggy clothes, and long pants, why not just educate the men to have respect? Many lives have been ruined as a result of these acts, and they often go unpunished. It's always assumed that the woman is to blame. They believe they seduced the man to get his attention, and that he then got carried away and started doing inappropriate things, but this is far from the truth. Always believe the victim.</p><br />
