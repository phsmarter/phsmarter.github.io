She is very good at her studies and always does her work attentively in the class. Our teacher loves her. We too are very good friends. We share many things with each other. Without her, I feel very uneasy. She is well mannered and she respects my feelings. We have many good habits and our manners are very common.

When I got there, there were a lot of people than I anticipated, I started thinking if I should just go home, but then a puppy ran to me with a boy my age just a meter away. I petted the puppy, and I asked him if it was his, and he said yes. We continued talking until the sun was about to set. Then we went home after that. That was the day I met my best friend.</p><p></p><p>Sorry kung panget, inaantok na kasi ako. Paki bilang nalang, o paki bago kung di mo nagustuhan.</p><br />
