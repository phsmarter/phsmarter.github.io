FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor
Filipinos are brave and pride they stand for
To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin
The religion of Christianity in God we believed in
Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.

                                            Have you ever heard of stories about teenagers who have experienced family conflicts? These teenagers experienced issues and concerns that bother them. Direction: Read the story on “Family Conflict” and then answer the question below. Anna was brought up in a really strict religious family. It was expected that they should go to church and that they would “uphold the faith” as her parents put it. When she was younger, her parents always decide how she wears her clothes or what movies she watches. But as she got older, she found out that there were still a lot of things that she and her parents did not agree on – her choice of friends, what she wanted to study, or how she chose to spend her vacant time. Anna left home when she was 17 to study in college. She made many friends with different religions, beliefs, values and cultures. The great thing is they all respect each other’s opinion. When Anna visited home, she found it hard to deal with not being able to express her opinions with her parents as she freely did when she was with her friends. Eventually, Anna realized that if she wanted her parents to respect what she had to say, she has to try and respect their opinions too. Once she made an effort to respect their values and opinions, getting along with her parents have been a lot easier. Question: Based on the story above, how did Anna deal with her problems?​</a>

FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor
Filipinos are brave and pride they stand for
To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin
The religion of Christianity in God we believed in
Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.

                            8. Have you ever heard of stories about teenagers who have experienced family conflicts? These teenagers experienced issues and concerns that bother them. Direction: Read the story on “Family Conflict” and then answer the question below. Anna was brought up in a really strict religious family. It was expected that they should go to church and that they would “uphold the faith” as her parents put it. When she was younger, her parents always decide how she wears her clothes or what movies she watches. But as she got older, she found out that there were still a lot of things that she and her parents did not agree on – her choice of friends, what she wanted to study, or how she chose to spend her vacant time. Anna left home when she was 17 to study in college. She made many friends with different religions, beliefs, values and cultures. The great thing is they all respect each other’s opinion. When Anna visited home, she found it hard to deal with not being able to express her opinions with her parents as she freely did when she was with her friends. Eventually, Anna realized that if she wanted her parents to respect what she had to say, she has to try and respect their opinions too. Once she made an effort to respect their values and opinions, getting along with her parents have been a lot easier. Question: Based on the story above, how did Anna deal with her problems?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Religious diversity is the fact that there are significant differences in religious belief and practice. It has always been recognized by people outside the smallest and most isolated communities. But since early modern times, increasing information from travel, publishing, and emigration have forced thoughtful people to reflect more deeply on religious diversity. Roughly, pluralistic approaches to religious diversity say that, within bounds, one religion is as good as any other. In contrast, exclusivist approaches say that only one religion is uniquely valuable. Finally, inclusivist theories try to steer a middle course by agreeing with exclusivism that one religion has the most value while also agreeing with pluralism that others still have significant religious value.</p><p></p><p>What values are at issue? Literature since 1950 focuses on the truth or rationality of religious teachings, the veridicality (conformity with reality) of religious experiences, salvific efficacy (the ability to deliver whatever cure religion should provide), and alleged directedness towards one and the same ultimate religious object.</p><p></p><p>The exclusivist-inclusivist-pluralist trichotomy has become standard since the 1980s. Unfortunately, it is often used with some mix of the above values in mind, leaving it unclear exactly which values are pertinent. While this trichotomy is sometimes thought of in terms of general attitudes that a religious person may have towards other religions—approximately the attitudes of rejection, limited openness, and wide acceptance respectively—in this article they figure as theories concerning the facts of religious diversity. “Religious pluralism” in some contexts means an informed, tolerant, and appreciative or sympathetic view of the various religions. In other contexts, “religious pluralism” is a normative principle requiring that peoples of all or most religions should be treated the same.  In this article, “religious pluralism” refers to a theory about the diversity of religions. Finally, some authors use “descriptive religious pluralism” to mean what is here called “religious diversity,” calling “normative religious pluralism” views that are here called varieties of “religious pluralism.” While the trichotomy has been repeatedly challenged, it is still widely used, and can be precisely defined in various ways.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps</p><p>If its wrong please correct me </p><p>Or even report it </p><p></p><p>Thank You</p><br />

                            25. 4. How does a person explain and share his religion or faith with other religiousfaith /organizations in his or her community in the spirit of respect and unityamidst diversity?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Religious diversity is the fact that there are significant differences in religious belief and practice. It has always been recognized by people outside the smallest and most isolated communities. But since early modern times, increasing information from travel, publishing, and emigration have forced thoughtful people to reflect more deeply on religious diversity. Roughly, pluralistic approaches to religious diversity say that, within bounds, one religion is as good as any other. In contrast, exclusivist approaches say that only one religion is uniquely valuable. Finally, inclusivist theories try to steer a middle course by agreeing with exclusivism that one religion has the most value while also agreeing with pluralism that others still have significant religious value.</p><p></p><p>What values are at issue? Literature since 1950 focuses on the truth or rationality of religious teachings, the veridicality (conformity with reality) of religious experiences, salvific efficacy (the ability to deliver whatever cure religion should provide), and alleged directedness towards one and the same ultimate religious object.</p><p></p><p>The exclusivist-inclusivist-pluralist trichotomy has become standard since the 1980s. Unfortunately, it is often used with some mix of the above values in mind, leaving it unclear exactly which values are pertinent. While this trichotomy is sometimes thought of in terms of general attitudes that a religious person may have towards other religions—approximately the attitudes of rejection, limited openness, and wide acceptance respectively—in this article they figure as theories concerning the facts of religious diversity. “Religious pluralism” in some contexts means an informed, tolerant, and appreciative or sympathetic view of the various religions. In other contexts, “religious pluralism” is a normative principle requiring that peoples of all or most religions should be treated the same.  In this article, “religious pluralism” refers to a theory about the diversity of religions. Finally, some authors use “descriptive religious pluralism” to mean what is here called “religious diversity,” calling “normative religious pluralism” views that are here called varieties of “religious pluralism.” While the trichotomy has been repeatedly challenged, it is still widely used, and can be precisely defined in various ways.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps </p><p>If im wrong please correct me</p><p>Or even report me if you want</p><p></p><p>Thank You</p><p></p><p></p><br />
