                            1. Write an essay about POVERTY AND HUNGER (500 words)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p><p>             Hunger and poverty</p><p></p><p>According to the announcement from United Nation, each day about 25000 people die because of hunger. And hunger caused by poverty. It means, now, hunger and poverty is stillremaining as an urgent problem for us, for every country. We have to prevent it and save manysouls.There are many nutritious food all around the world. But the problem is, they all living in poverty, not able to buy food.</p><p>They’re trapped in severe poverty and it make their children also</p><p>live in poverty and not have much nutrition to</p><p>live. They’re being constantly living in</p><p>malnutrition. Malnutrition makes them always getting sick. It makes them not able to work and</p><p>didn’t produce money for themselves and their family. So, they keep living in poverty and</p><p>hunger. Finally, they die by the time.</p><p>What about us? Don’t we sad to hear that? Don’t you ever aware that Indonesia is one of </p><p>the country that living in hunger and poverty? You know, United Nation said that Indonesia isone of seven countries who have the most of underfed citizens. We must be sad to hear thisinformation. This is an urgent problem for us, as a citizen of Indonesia.Our presiden, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has made a program to overcome poverty. He saidthat he will make that as a first priorities. Like giving direct help like BLP (Bantuan LangsungTunai) and many other projects. But that is not enough to overcome hunger and poverty inIndonesia. And nowadays poverty and hunger is like making a scar to Indonesia. We as aneducational student, we must do something to prevent it.Wiping out hunger will overcome serious effort and make our country to become a realdevelopment country. People living in good life, have steady jobs, and able to enjoy nutritiousfood. Same like us, people who was given by God chance to enjoy it.</p><p>Let’s do the same with</p><p>them. The key is honest. Take what you must be take, and rejecting what you have to reject. Stopcorruption. Be honest. Stop poverty. Prevent hunger. </p><br />

                            2. 400 word essay about poverty​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Poverty is the worst form of violence”. – Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p></p><p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p></p><p>How Poverty is Measured?</p><p></p><p>For measuring poverty United nations have devised two measures of poverty – Absolute &amp; relative poverty.  Absolute poverty is used to measure poverty in developing countries like India. Relative poverty is used to measure poverty in developed countries like the USA. In absolute poverty, a line based on the minimum level of income has been created &amp; is called a poverty line.  If per day income of a family is below this level, then it is poor or below the poverty line. If per day income of a family is above this level, then it is non-poor or above the poverty line. In India, the new poverty line is  Rs 32 in rural areas and Rs 47 in urban areas.</p><p></p><p>Causes of Poverty</p><p></p><p>According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.</p><p></p><p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.</p><p></p><p>In some countries, especially African countries like Somalia, a long period of civil war has made poverty widespread. This is because all the resources &amp; money is being spent in war instead of public welfare. Countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. are prone to natural disasters like cyclone, etc. These disasters occur every year causing poverty to rise.</p><p></p><p>Ill Effects of Poverty</p><p></p><p>Poverty affects the life of a poor family. A poor person is not able to take proper food &amp; nutrition &amp;his capacity to work reduces. Reduced capacity to work further reduces his income, making him poorer. Children from poor family never get proper schooling &amp; proper nutrition. They have to work to support their family &amp; this destroys their childhood. Some of them may also involve in crimes like theft, murder, robbery, etc. A poor person remains uneducated &amp; is forced to live under unhygienic conditions in slums. There are no proper sanitation &amp; drinking water facility in slums &amp; he falls ill often &amp;  his health deteriorates. A poor person generally dies an early death. So, all social evils are related to poverty.</p><p></p><p>Government Schemes to Remove Poverty</p><p></p><p>The government of India also took several measures to eradicate poverty from India. Some of them are – creating employment opportunities, controlling population, etc. In India, about 60% of the population is still dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Government has taken certain measures to promote agriculture in India. The government constructed certain dams &amp; canals in our country to provide easy availability of water for irrigation. Government has also taken steps for the cheap availability of seeds &amp; farming equipment to promote agriculture. Government is also promoting farming of cash crops like cotton, instead of food crops. In cities, the government is promoting industrialization to create more jobs. Government has also opened  ‘Ration shops’. Other measures include providing free &amp; compulsory education for children up to 14 years of age, scholarship to deserving students from a poor background, providing subsidized houses to poor people, etc.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is a social evil, we can also contribute to control it. For example- we can simply donate old clothes to poor people, we can also sponsor the education of a poor child or we can utilize our free time by teaching poor students. Remember before wasting food, somebody is still sleeping hungry.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Regardless of its causes, poverty has devastating consequences for the people who live in it. Much research conducted and/or analyzed by scholars, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations has documented the effects of poverty (and near poverty) on the lives of the poor (Lindsey, 2009; Moore, et. al., 2009; Ratcliffe &amp; McKernan, 2010; Sanders, 2011). Many of these studies focus on childhood poverty, and these studies make it very clear that childhood poverty has lifelong consequences. In general, poor children are more likely to be poor as adults, more likely to drop out of high school, more likely to become a teenaged parent, and more likely to have employment problems. Although only 1 percent of children who are never poor end up being poor as young adults, 32 percent of poor children become poor as young adults</p><br />

One of the first things we see is that poverty doesn’t exist all by itself. It is simply one end of an overall distribution of income and wealth in society as a whole. Poverty is both a structural aspect of the system and consequence of how the system is organized and how people participate in it.</strong></p><p><strong>The system we have for producing and distributing wealth is capitalist. It is organized in ways that allow a small portion (the 1%) to control most of the capital (factories, machinery, tools) used to produce wealth.</strong></p><p><strong>Nowadays, as people know that poverty refers to one of the biggest issues in the world so far. Many countries around the world still suffer from it and have difficult times to get rid of it. The phenomenon of poverty, an important phenomenon hard to identify and it destroys some countries in certain aspects and this issue can cause other problems for all economic and political aspects. I think that, there are many major reasons that put the world in this a bad situation. The first and most important reason that put some countries in poverty is the political instability. Political instability is one of the factors associated with poverty. In most of the countries in the world, there is a political instability.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>PLSS FOLLOW AND LIKE FOR MORE HELPS, THANKS</p><p></p><br />

                            8. Explain Poverty through climate change (climate justice) 500 words​</h2><br />
                        <p>Climate change is an issue that is not only a matter of environmental concern, but it is also an issue that has economic, social, and political impacts. Climate change is defined as a long-term shift in weather patterns caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrialization. The effects of climate change include rising temperatures, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and changes in precipitation patterns, which all have significant consequences on the environment and society.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant effects of climate change is its impact on poverty. Climate change disproportionately affects the poorest and most vulnerable communities around the world, exacerbating existing inequalities and hindering economic development. People who live in poverty are often the most exposed to the adverse effects of climate change, such as drought, floods, and hurricanes, as they lack the resources and infrastructure to cope with these impacts. In many developing countries, agriculture is the primary source of livelihood, and climate change-induced droughts and floods significantly reduce crop yields, leading to food insecurity and malnutrition.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, climate change has a significant impact on human health, leading to an increase in the incidence of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and cholera. Poor communities are more susceptible to these diseases, as they often lack access to basic healthcare, sanitation, and clean water. The economic burden of climate change-induced health issues is substantial, particularly in developing countries, where healthcare is often inaccessible or unaffordable.</p><p></p><p>Climate change also exacerbates social and economic inequalities by disrupting the livelihoods of people in vulnerable communities, leading to increased migration and conflict. As the impact of climate change worsens, natural resources such as water, land, and food become scarce, leading to competition and conflict between communities. Poor people are often the most affected by these conflicts, as they lack the resources to protect their interests.</p><p></p><p>To address the issue of climate change-induced poverty, a concept called climate justice has emerged. Climate justice is about recognizing that those who contribute the least to climate change are often the most affected by it. It is about holding those responsible for climate change accountable for their actions and ensuring that they pay for the damage they have caused. Climate justice also means supporting vulnerable communities in adapting to the impacts of climate change and providing them with the resources and infrastructure they need to build resilience.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, climate change is not just an environmental issue; it is an economic, social, and political issue that has significant impacts on poverty. The most vulnerable communities, such as those living in poverty, are the most affected by climate change, and climate justice is essential to address the issue of climate change-induced poverty. Governments, corporations, and individuals must take responsibility for their actions and work towards a sustainable future that prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable people and the planet.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ang paghahanda sa kalamidad at tungkolin ng pamahalaan at ang bawat mamayan may mga ahensya na pamahalalang nakatalagang tauhan sa katigasan ng mamayan sa panahon ng kalamidad metro manila development agency (MMDA) ang ahensya ng nilikha upang mabigyan ng tuwirang serbisyo ang mga mamamayan ng metro manila (MCK).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>nadi em sure pero pwede na ata yanhaha</p><br />

                        <p>Poverty never gets out of the problems that most Filipino citizens face. An unknown author once said, “Poverty is a choice, and not fate.” No one ever wanted to be poor; thus there must be reasons why they had come up to their situation. Some believe that the government has something to do with the constantly increasing number of poor people, but is it really their fault? I guess they get the blames because they are the one who has all the fund of our country.</p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><p>STAY SAFE AND STUDY MORE! </p><br />

The current human genome is the result of countless mutations that occurred before the appearance of modern humans some 200,000 years and after it. Some of those mutations were really beneficial and lasted for a long time while some were outright bad or only situationally good. The tinkering with the genetic setup of a human for removal of any inefficient mutations and insertion of useful and better genes comes under transhumanism. In addition to ineffective mutations, there are also some mutations which are outright harmful and can cause different diseases and conditions. Transhumanism deals with these mutations and increases the lifespan of a person. Transhumanism is an active counter to aging. It makes a person smarter, stronger and energetic.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>https://myassignmenthelp.com/mah-bot-editor.html</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poverty has a particularly adverse effect on the academic outcomes of children, especially during early childhood. Chronic stress associated with living in poverty has been shown to adversely affect children’s concentration and memory which may impact their ability to learn. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in 2008, the dropout rate of students living in low-income families was about four and one-half times greater than the rate of children from higher-income families (8.7 percent versus 2.0 percent). The academic achievement gap for poorer youth is particularly pronounced for low-income African American and Hispanic children compared with their more affluent White peers. Underresourced schools in poorer communities struggle to meet the learning needs of their students and aid them in fulfilling their potential. Inadequate education contributes to the cycle of poverty by making it more difficult for low-income children to lift themselves and future generations out of poverty.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>It should be a perfect title if it could describe all poverty matters very well. </strong>Poverty in the Philippines is more pervasive and chronic than in surrounding ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) t nations. While the Philippines' poverty rate has fallen over the previous quarter century, the decline has been slower than in other ASEAN nations. Past economic policies that slowed growth by discriminating against agriculture and discouraging investment in human capital are partially to blame for the Philippines' sluggish progress in lowering the incidence of poverty.  These policies reinforced powerful interest groups that prevented or delayed economic progress.</p><p>In contrast, the Philippines initiated political and economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and since 1994, annual GDP growth has increased to approximately 5 %.  With quicker growth, the proportion of Filipinos living below the poverty line is dropping, but agricultural reform and higher investment in human capital would allow for a more significant decline. </p><p></p><p><strong>Learn More about the essay title:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/25826173?referrer=searchResults</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hope it Helps</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#Carry on Learning<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.<p></p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> <strong>hope it helps:) </strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Poverty can be expressed differently from many viewpoints (Spector, 2013). Poverty is characterized by their physical, mental, and spiritual state. Physically, individuals can be affected by the environment or other factors, such as, their lifestyle. Mentally, individuals affected by poverty are not educated or do not have the opportunity for advancement. Spiritually, they find themselves feeling of hopelessness. Poverty can co-exist within many subcultures that reside is particular areas, consider California. In California, there are dense populations that live below the poverty line that is also a part of other subcultures. When income, education, and lifestyles are compromised many health issues can arise. To comeback these harsh lifestyles, many groups have come together to improve and educate people who currently live in poverty. Health educators also manipulate their strategic efforts to have the most impact on the community. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> YOU</strong><strong> UNDERSTAND</strong><strong> ❤️</strong></p><br />

It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p></p><p>Having poverty is unfair, unethical, and dangerous. The Philippines should abolish poverty because its people deserve to be free of it. Poverty in the Philippines is one of the most serious problems that the government must deal with. In relation to its nature, poverty in the Philippines arose from the rapid population growth in the country. The effects of it are very visible in nature. Poverty causes many Filipinos to not pursue their education. Others seem to be contented of their lives as poor. Many parents cannot afford to send their children to school because, of the financial problem.</p><p></p><p>More Having poverty is unfair, unethical, and dangerous.

Poverty causes many Filipinos to not pursue their education. Others seem to be contented of their lives as poor. Many parents cannot afford to send their children to school because, of the financial problem. The majority who are affected of this problem are those who are living in the mountain areas because, some of them are lived in miles away from schools.</p><p></p><p>With poverty taking a toll on Filipinos, parents often can't make enough money to support their families; children then have to be taken out of school to work in harsh conditions. Statistics show that around 3.6 million children, from ages 5-17, are child laborers in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>What are solutions to poverty?</p><p></p><p>Improve food security and access to clean water</p><p></p><p>Simply eating three meals a day and getting a healthy amount of calories and nutrients can go a long way to addressing the cycle of poverty. When a person doesn't have enough to eat, they lack the strength and energy needed to work.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong><strong> </strong><strong>SIM</strong><strong>PLE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>'THANK</strong><strong> </strong><strong>YOU</strong><strong>'</strong><strong> </strong><strong>WILL</strong><strong> </strong><strong>DO</strong><strong> </strong><strong>;</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />
