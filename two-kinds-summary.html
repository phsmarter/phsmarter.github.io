A physical change is a change in the size and shape of a substance. Hardness, shape, mass, and density are physical properties which may be involved in a physical change. In a chemical change, however, new substances with different physical properties are produced.
In this investigation, you will be conducting a simple experiment. You will classify the result as a physical or chemical change. It is up to you to determine the type of change. Use the steps of the scientific method as you work.
EXPERIMENT
Supplies needed: sugar, beaker or dish, water, stirring rod or teaspoon
Instructions:
1. Place several teaspoons of sugar in a small beaker half full of water, and stir until the water is clear.
2. Pour some of the solution into a dish. Set the dish on a shelf or a windowsill. Observe the dish for a day or two. Record what you observe.
Compile a scientific report from your hypotheses, observations, data, inferences, and conclusions. Be sure to answer the questions below in your summary and include your personal findings.
What did you observe after the solution set in the dish for a day or two?
What kind of change (physical or chemical) occurred in this experiment?
How do you know the kind of change?
What happened to the sugar?
Name another mixture that could be separated in this way.
What did you find out from this experiment? Be thoughtful in your answer.</a>

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the passage below. Then write your own summary in a sentence or two . There were various kinds of diets during the Renaissance, depending on where people lived and what social class they belonged to. Most people of that time were peasants. Peasants were generally poor and did almost all of the hard work. A typical peasant meal consisted of SOUP or mush with black bread. Soup was made from scraps of vegetables or eggs. Mush was made from cooked grains. Peasants ate very little meat, which was expensive and hard to come by, since the salt needed to preserve it was very expensive. Peasants who lived near bodies of water ate fish. Wealthier people like merchants and nobles had a much more varied diet, and even their soups and broths were more flavorfut since people in these classes could afford exotic spices and sugar. Meat was also more available to them. No one really drank water during the Renaissance, since there was no way to purify it like there is today. Most people drank wine or beer.Pa sagot ng maayos:(​</a>

Paragraph 1: Elephants are the largest land animals in the world. Whales are the largest sea animals. These two huge animals may be related. Biologists now believe that the ancestors of elephants once lived in the sea. There is plenty of evidence to support this idea. For example, the shape of an elephant's head is similar to a whale's. Also, elephants are excellent swimmers. Some have chosen to swim for food to islands up to 300 hundred miles from shore. Like the whale, the elephant, too, uses sounds to show anger or for other kinds of communication. Finally, in certain ways, female elephants behave much like female whales. When an elephant or a whale baby is born, a female friend stays nearby to help the mother. Comprehension Questions: 1. What is the summary of the paragraph? 2.

Cite your source properly.The world of 2030 will be radically transformed from our world today. By 2030, no country—whether the US, China, or any other large country—will be a hegemonic power. The empowerment of individuals and diffusion of power among states and from states to informal networks will have a dramatic impact, largely reversing the historic rise of the West since 1750, restoring Asia’s weight in the global economy, and ushering in a new era of “democratization” at the international and domestic level. In addition to individual empowerment and the diffusion of state power, we believe that two other megatrends willshape our world out to 2030: demographic patterns, especially rapid aging; and growing resource demands which, in the cases of food and water, might lead to scarcities. These trends, which are virtually certain, exist today, but during the next 15-20 years they will gain much greater momentum. Underpinning the megatrends are tectonic shifts—critical changes to key features of our global environment that will affect how the world “works”.Extrapolations of the megatrends would alone point to a changed world by 2030— but the world could be transformed in radically different ways. We believe that six key game-changers—questions regarding the global economy, governance, conflict, regional instability, technology, and the role of the United States—will largely determine what kind oftransformed world we will inhabit in 2030. Several potential Black Swans—discrete events— would cause large-scale disruption (see page xi). All but two of these—the possibility of a democratic China or a reformed Iran—would have negative repercussions. Based upon what we know about the megatrends and the possible interactions betweenthe megatrends and the game-changers, we have delineated four archetypal futures that represent distinct pathways for the world out to 2030. None of these alternative worlds is inevitable. In reality, the future probably will consist of elements from all the scenarios (National Intelligence Council, 2012, p. iii).ReferenceNational Intelligence Council (2012). Global trends 2030: Alternative worlds.

                                            Activity 4.2 Instructions. Read the summary of the story below and answer the question that follows. (20 points) There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to get as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it tumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired blowing, the bamboo tree stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet," the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well - lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope." The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly.

Cite your source properly.The world of 2030 will be radically transformed from our world today. By 2030, no country—whether the US, China, or any other large country—will be a hegemonic power. The empowerment of individuals and diffusion of power among states and from states to informal networks will have a dramatic impact, largely reversing the historic rise of the West since 1750, restoring Asia’s weight in the global economy, and ushering in a new era of “democratization” at the international and domestic level. In addition to individual empowerment and the diffusion of state power, we believe that two other megatrends willshape our world out to 2030: demographic patterns, especially rapid aging; and growing resource demands which, in the cases of food and water, might lead to scarcities. These trends, which are virtually certain, exist today, but during the next 15-20 years they will gain much greater momentum. Underpinning the megatrends are tectonic shifts—critical changes to key features of our global environment that will affect how the world “works”.Extrapolations of the megatrends would alone point to a changed world by 2030— but the world could be transformed in radically different ways. We believe that six key game-changers—questions regarding the global economy, governance, conflict, regional instability, technology, and the role of the United States—will largely determine what kind oftransformed world we will inhabit in 2030. Several potential Black Swans—discrete events— would cause large-scale disruption (see page xi). All but two of these—the possibility of a democratic China or a reformed Iran—would have negative repercussions. Based upon what we know about the megatrends and the possible interactions betweenthe megatrends and the game-changers, we have delineated four archetypal futures that represent distinct pathways for the world out to 2030. None of these alternative worlds is inevitable. In reality, the future probably will consist of elements from all the scenarios (National Intelligence Council, 2012, p. iii).ReferenceNational Intelligence Council (2012).

                                            Read the paragraph. Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways. One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016). Joy In Learning English 5. Vibal Group, Inc for the Department of Education) Which sentence states the generalization? How did you know? What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot. Theme refers to the author's message about life or human nature he or she tries to convey in the story. The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</a>

Most people of that time were peasants. Peasants were generally poor and did almost all of the hard work. A typical peasant meal consisted of SOUP or mush with black bread. Soup was made from scraps of vegetables or egge. Mush was made from cooked grains. Peasants ate very little meat, which was expensive and hard to come by, since the salt needed to preserve it was very expensive. Peasants who lived near bodies of water ate fish. Wealthier people like merchants and nobles had a much more varies diet, and even their soups and broths were more flavorful since people in these classes could afford exotic spices and sugar. Meat was also more available to them. No one really drank water during the Renaissance, since there was no way to purify it like there is today. Most people drank wine or beer.​</a>

                                            MAKATO AND THE COWRIE SHELL (A Summary) By Supannee Khanchanathiti Once upon a time, there was an orphan whose name was Makato. He didn't have any ways to support himself, so he did every kind of work such as, carrying heavy things, clearing away forest, and even feeding pigs. Although he was paid only a small wage, he never idled and was satisfied of everything. As a result, people around him noticed his hard work and were very pleased of him. Makato dreamed of going on an adventure to a far and bigger place where the land was fertile, and the people were kind. He left his village and set out into the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a long month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhotai. He met an old woman who helped her. He told her that he had come from a far place and he wanted to see the king, who he had heard was kind. He worked with the king's elephants and he started working for her. After some time working, he finally met with the king. During the encounter, he picked up a cowrie shell that was lying on the road and offered it to the king (Cowrie shells were used for money, but just one was practically worthless). When Makato offered the shell to the king, the king said he could keep it. Makato was wondering what he could repay to honor the king's gift. He saw some lettuce seeds at a stall in the market and thought that he could grow them. He asked the woman about them, and she let him have as many as would stick to his finger in retum for his treasured cowrie shell . He made the lettuces grew abundantly. The next time he saw the king, he gave one to him and told him he grew them from the shell that he had given him. The king was very impressed and gave him a job in the castle. Eventually. Makalo grew up and married the daughter of the king. 1. Describe Makalo. 2. Give at least two transition signals used in the story.​</a>

                            10. DIRECTIONS: Read the passage below. Then write your own summary in a sentence or two . There were various kinds of diets during the Renaissance, depending on where people lived and what social class they belonged to. Most people of that time were peasants. Peasants were generally poor and did almost all of the hard work. A typical peasant meal consisted of SOUP or mush with black bread. Soup was made from scraps of vegetables or eggs. Mush was made from cooked grains. Peasants ate very little meat, which was expensive and hard to come by, since the salt needed to preserve it was very expensive. Peasants who lived near bodies of water ate fish. Wealthier people like merchants and nobles had a much more varied diet, and even their soups and broths were more flavorfut since people in these classes could afford exotic spices and sugar. Meat was also more available to them. No one really drank water during the Renaissance, since there was no way to purify it like there is today. Most people drank wine or beer.Pa sagot ng maayos:(​</h2><br />

Whales are the largest sea animals. These two huge animals may be related. Biologists now believe that the ancestors of elephants once lived in the sea. There is plenty of evidence to support this idea. For example, the shape of an elephant's head is similar to a whale's. Also, elephants are excellent swimmers. Some have chosen to swim for food to islands up to 300 hundred miles from shore. Like the whale, the elephant, too, uses sounds to show anger or for other kinds of communication. Finally, in certain ways, female elephants behave much like female whales. When an elephant or a whale baby is born, a female friend stays nearby to help the mother. Comprehension Questions: 1.

Cite your source properly.The world of 2030 will be radically transformed from our world today. By 2030, no country—whether the US, China, or any other large country—will be a hegemonic power. The empowerment of individuals and diffusion of power among states and from states to informal networks will have a dramatic impact, largely reversing the historic rise of the West since 1750, restoring Asia’s weight in the global economy, and ushering in a new era of “democratization” at the international and domestic level. In addition to individual empowerment and the diffusion of state power, we believe that two other megatrends willshape our world out to 2030: demographic patterns, especially rapid aging; and growing resource demands which, in the cases of food and water, might lead to scarcities. These trends, which are virtually certain, exist today, but during the next 15-20 years they will gain much greater momentum. Underpinning the megatrends are tectonic shifts—critical changes to key features of our global environment that will affect how the world “works”.Extrapolations of the megatrends would alone point to a changed world by 2030— but the world could be transformed in radically different ways. We believe that six key game-changers—questions regarding the global economy, governance, conflict, regional instability, technology, and the role of the United States—will largely determine what kind oftransformed world we will inhabit in 2030. Several potential Black Swans—discrete events— would cause large-scale disruption (see page xi). All but two of these—the possibility of a democratic China or a reformed Iran—would have negative repercussions. Based upon what we know about the megatrends and the possible interactions betweenthe megatrends and the game-changers, we have delineated four archetypal futures that represent distinct pathways for the world out to 2030. None of these alternative worlds is inevitable. In reality, the future probably will consist of elements from all the scenarios (National Intelligence Council, 2012, p. iii).ReferenceNational Intelligence Council (2012). Global trends 2030: Alternative worlds.

                            17. Activity 4.2 Instructions. Read the summary of the story below and answer the question that follows. (20 points) There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to get as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it tumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired blowing, the bamboo tree stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet," the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well - lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope." The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives up, no matter how hard life was before and even now... the FILIPINO remains to be PLIANT like the Bamboo..1. What is the Filipino positive characteristics describe in the selection? 2.

                            19. Underline the main idea in the following texts and restate them in your own words in one to two sentences. Use appropriate reporting verbs. Cite your source properly.The world of 2030 will be radically transformed from our world today. By 2030, no country—whether the US, China, or any other large country—will be a hegemonic power. The empowerment of individuals and diffusion of power among states and from states to informal networks will have a dramatic impact, largely reversing the historic rise of the West since 1750, restoring Asia’s weight in the global economy, and ushering in a new era of “democratization” at the international and domestic level. In addition to individual empowerment and the diffusion of state power, we believe that two other megatrends willshape our world out to 2030: demographic patterns, especially rapid aging; and growing resource demands which, in the cases of food and water, might lead to scarcities. These trends, which are virtually certain, exist today, but during the next 15-20 years they will gain much greater momentum. Underpinning the megatrends are tectonic shifts—critical changes to key features of our global environment that will affect how the world “works”.Extrapolations of the megatrends would alone point to a changed world by 2030— but the world could be transformed in radically different ways. We believe that six key game-changers—questions regarding the global economy, governance, conflict, regional instability, technology, and the role of the United States—will largely determine what kind oftransformed world we will inhabit in 2030. Several potential Black Swans—discrete events— would cause large-scale disruption (see page xi). All but two of these—the possibility of a democratic China or a reformed Iran—would have negative repercussions. Based upon what we know about the megatrends and the possible interactions betweenthe megatrends and the game-changers, we have delineated four archetypal futures that represent distinct pathways for the world out to 2030. None of these alternative worlds is inevitable. In reality, the future probably will consist of elements from all the scenarios (National Intelligence Council, 2012, p. iii).ReferenceNational Intelligence Council (2012).

                            20. Read the paragraph. Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways. One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016). Joy In Learning English 5. Vibal Group, Inc for the Department of Education) Which sentence states the generalization? How did you know? What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot. Theme refers to the author's message about life or human nature he or she tries to convey in the story. The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The generalization in the paragraph is that Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways, but it holds the greatest message of all time - the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. This is stated in the last sentence of the paragraph. The examples presented to validate this generalization are the three ways in which Asma's letter is different from a typical Christmas greeting card, and the message of love and justice that the letter contains. The words and phrases that introduce these examples are "One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ...And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth.

Most people of that time were peasants. Peasants were generally poor and did almost all of the hard work. A typical peasant meal consisted of SOUP or mush with black bread. Soup was made from scraps of vegetables or egge. Mush was made from cooked grains. Peasants ate very little meat, which was expensive and hard to come by, since the salt needed to preserve it was very expensive. Peasants who lived near bodies of water ate fish. Wealthier people like merchants and nobles had a much more varies diet, and even their soups and broths were more flavorful since people in these classes could afford exotic spices and sugar. Meat was also more available to them. No one really drank water during the Renaissance, since there was no way to purify it like there is today. Most people drank wine or beer.​</h2><br />

                            30. MAKATO AND THE COWRIE SHELL (A Summary) By Supannee Khanchanathiti Once upon a time, there was an orphan whose name was Makato. He didn't have any ways to support himself, so he did every kind of work such as, carrying heavy things, clearing away forest, and even feeding pigs. Although he was paid only a small wage, he never idled and was satisfied of everything. As a result, people around him noticed his hard work and were very pleased of him. Makato dreamed of going on an adventure to a far and bigger place where the land was fertile, and the people were kind. He left his village and set out into the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a long month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhotai. He met an old woman who helped her. He told her that he had come from a far place and he wanted to see the king, who he had heard was kind. He worked with the king's elephants and he started working for her. After some time working, he finally met with the king. During the encounter, he picked up a cowrie shell that was lying on the road and offered it to the king (Cowrie shells were used for money, but just one was practically worthless). When Makato offered the shell to the king, the king said he could keep it. Makato was wondering what he could repay to honor the king's gift. He saw some lettuce seeds at a stall in the market and thought that he could grow them. He asked the woman about them, and she let him have as many as would stick to his finger in retum for his treasured cowrie shell . He made the lettuces grew abundantly. The next time he saw the king, he gave one to him and told him he grew them from the shell that he had given him. The king was very impressed and gave him a job in the castle. Eventually. Makalo grew up and married the daughter of the king. 1. Describe Makalo. 2. Give at least two transition signals used in the story.​</h2><br />
