                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The existing literature of the Philippine ethnic groups at the time of conquest and conversion into Christianity was mainly oral, consisting of epics, legends, songs, riddles, and proverbs. The conquistador, especially its ecclesiastical arm, destroyed whatever written literature he could find, and hence rendered the system of writing (e.g., the Tagalog syllabary) inoperable. Among the only native systems of writing that have survived are the syllabaries of the Mindoro Mangyans and the Tagbanua of Palawan.</p><p></p><p>       The Spanish colonial strategy was to undermine the native oral tradition by substituting for it the story of the Passion of Christ (Lumbera, p. 14). Although Christ was by no means war-like or sexually attractive as many of the heroes of the oral epic tradition, the appeal of the Jesus myth inhered in the protagonist’s superior magic: by promising eternal life for everyone, he democratized the power to rise above death.</p><p></p><p>&lt; hope it helps. </p><p>&lt;follow for more.</p><p></p><br />

On LENGUA PARA DIABLO, What does it tell us about the current Philippine society? Discuss this in reference to our level of poverty, unemployment rate and quality of education today​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Apo on the wall by Bj Patino is a poem that talks about the narration of a child’s point of view about his rigorous Father and the hanging photo around the wall called “Apo”. The poem tells the reality of life during the reigning of Marcos alongside with the Martial Law. It is a reflection of the scenario of what and how the Filipinos experienced the tragic and traumatic event throughout the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. “Apo on the wall” shows the real situation concerning with the different perspective between millennial and those who lived through Martial law. This masterpiece of Bj Patino advocates reasonably close to the realization of giving importance on looking back to our past, moving forward through our present and ensuring the success of our future.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. In our culture father is considered the “haligi ng tahanan”, they are the face of the family. The father reflects what kind of family you are into. They are the role models of the family. What if a father loses his able to speak for himself?</p><p></p><p>The story shows how unemployment and poverty greatly affects the situation of the family, particularly if the father is the one that is unemployed. The father in the story lost his pride and ability to speak for himself. He lost it all due to the reason that he has no work and no longer can support and contribute to his family financially. He has no more confidence to share his own views and opinions and looked down by his’ own children.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The story said “The devil ate his words” he doesn’t more gain respect from his kids, no more pride and especially his dignity was lost. The situation is truly happening now in the society. This usually happens to young family that is caused by early pregnancy for they don’t have enough proper knowledge and education. These situations are really present to our community. The situation is really difficult to the father because he needs to sacrifice all of his pride and ego to stay home and monitor to their kids. There are many possibilities that may happen the father may have another affair or may use drugs of abuse. Not just that the kids may mock their fathers and be ashamed of them for they are not earning. This is really disheartening from the father’s side. That is why proper education and guidance of the family is really important. So that we won’t have these kinds of situations in our society for the main reason of this is LACK OF EDUCATION!</p><br />
