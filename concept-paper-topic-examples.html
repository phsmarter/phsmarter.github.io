The presence of the hazardous substancesbrought about by these three major types of pollution: land, air and water gravely affects ourhealth. For instance, a person may acquire skin problems and other deformities from the toxicwastes present in the land that we live in such as garbage, pesticides, heavy metals and otherchemicals. Air pollution caused by toxic gases, solid and liquid particles or aerosols, and otherhazardous air pollutants adversely contaminate the air that we breathe. Long-term exposure to airpollutants has been linked with diseases of the heart and lungs, cancers and other healthproblems. Lastly, water pollution observed in our primary water sources like oceans, rivers, anlakes is caused by the presence of industrial wastes, sewage and waste waters, chemical fertilizerand pesticides to be specific. Infectious diseases can be acquired through contaminated water arcan cause cholera, jaundice, liver damage and stomach illness in people.TopicSentence:ClassificationExamples of Hazardous SubstancPollution1.a.b.C.d.​</a>

"Blue printed" thesis statement is a statement that includes the main areas of support in theorder you will introduce them in your essay and thus acts as a blue print for the essay8. The Yankee Doodle Restaurant is a great place to eat, because the staff is friendly, the food isdelicious, and the atmosphere is relaxing is an example of blue printed thesis statement9. A thesis statement should reflect the main idea of an essay.10. Thesis Statement is the first sentence at the beginning of each paragraph,11. Something is implicit when it is cleared stated and spelled out and there is no room forconfusion, as in the writing of a contract or statute12. It is easy to write a concept paper but with careful study and research13 Clarification is an analysis of an abstract concept through investigation of examples and theidentification of critical and less critical attributes.14. To contrast is to give the opposite of the term that is defining.15. You can use definition, explication and clarification in making your concept paperanswer ​</a>

You have to read and understand these concepts and answer the activities afterwards, Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. Conflict Perspective An interactionist studying socialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication. For example, dressing baby boys in blue and baby girls in pink is one small way we convey messages about differences in gender roles. Symbolic Interactionism​</a>

                                            DAY 2LESSON PROPER:Textual aids refer to non-textual elements that help readersunderstand the content of the text. They also refer to elements thatstand- out from the main text such as titles and subtitles, bold,italicized and underlined texts. Non-textual elements includeillustrations, maps, tables, graphs and charts.These aids have two main functions, namely: first, to direct the readers"attention to important ideas in the text and second, to provide moreinformation as a supplement to what is already written.1. Titles and subtitles provide initial idea on what the text is all about, thusactivating what the readers already know about the topic. According to EliteEditing (2015), these aids "represent the key concepts (title) and supportingideas (subtitles) in the paper". The layering or positioning of these aidsconvey the ideas" level ofimportance and their prominent text formatdistinguish the idea that they contain from the rest of the text.Here is an interactive example so that you will understand betterhow titles and subtitles work as textual aids.NOTE TO LEARNERS: notice how the titles and subtitlespresented below and think of the answers to the questions thatfollow. Discussion of the answers follows after the example.1. What do you notice with these textual aids? How do theylook like?2. Between Title 1 and Title 2, which do you think is theoverall title of the article? Why do you say so?3. From all the titles, which are the key concepts and whichare the supporting details? Why do you say so?4. Based on how the sample is presented, do you think thepositioning of these titles is correct and appropriate? Whydo you say so?5. Given the titles and subtitles, what do you think is thearticle about? What do you already know about it?​</a>

You have to read and understand these concepts and answer the activities afterwards, Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. Conflict Perspective An interactionist studying socialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication. For example, dressing baby boys in blue and baby girls in pink is one small way we convey messages about differences in gender roles. Symbolic Interactionism​</h2><br />
