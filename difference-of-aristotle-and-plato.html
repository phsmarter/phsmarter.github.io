                            5. What are the views of plato and aristotle to elements?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Plato (c. 428–c. 348 BCE) and Aristotle (384–322 BCE) are generally regarded as the two greatest figures of Western philosophy. For some 20 years Aristotle was Plato’s student and colleague at the Academy in Athens, an institution for philosophical, scientific, and mathematical research and teaching founded by Plato in the 380s. Although Aristotle revered his teacher, his philosophy eventually departed from Plato’s in important respects. Aristotle also investigated areas of philosophy and fields of science that Plato did not seriously consider. According to a conventional view, Plato’s philosophy is abstract and utopian, whereas Aristotle’s is empirical, practical, and commonsensical. Such contrasts are famously suggested in the fresco School of Athens (1510–11) by the Italian Renaissance painter Raphael, which depicts Plato and Aristotle together in conversation, surrounded by philosophers, scientists, and artists of earlier and later ages. Plato, holding a copy of his dialogue Timeo (Timaeus), points upward to the heavens; Aristotle, holding his Etica (Ethics), points outward to the world.

                            6. what is the difference between Socratic, Plato and Aristotle about the nature of man?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC and lasted through the Hellenistic period (323 BC-30 BC). Greek philosophy covers an absolutely enormous amount of topics including: political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology (the study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality), logic, biology, rhetoric, and aesthetics (branch of philosophy dealing with art, beauty, and taste). Greek philosophy is known for its undeniable influence on Western thought. Although there were Greek philosophers before their respective births, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are the only three worth focusing on during this period.</p><p></p><p>Socrates, born in Athens in 470 BC, is often credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy. The cloud of mystery surrounding his life and philosophical viewpoints propose a problem; a problem so large that it’s given a name itself: The Socratic Problem. Since he did not write philosophical texts, all knowledge related to him is entirely dependent on the writings of other people of the time period. Works by Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, and Aristophanes contain all of the knowledge known about this enigmatic figure. His largest contribution to philosophy is the Socratic method. The Socratic method is defined as a form of inquiry and discussion between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to illuminate ideas. This method is performed by asking question after question with the purpose of seeking to expose contradictions in one’s thoughts, guiding him/her to arrive at a solid, tenable conclusion. The principle underlying the Socratic Method is that humans learn through the use of reasoning and logic; ultimately finding holes in their own theories and then patching them up.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Plato, student of Socrates, also has mystery surrounding him. His birth day is estimated to fall between 428 BC and 423 BC. He’s known for being the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. My favorite of Plato’s contributions to philosophy, and the one I’m going to focus on, is the Theory of Forms. This theory was created to solve two problems, one of ethics and one of permanence and change. The ethical problem is: how can humans live a fulfilling life in an ever changing world if everything that they hold close to them can be easily taken away? The problem dealing with permanence and change is: How can the world appear to be both permanent and changing? The world we perceive through senses seems to be always changing–which is a pretty clear observation. The world that we perceive through the mind, seems to be permanent and unchanging. Which world perceived is more real? Why are we seen two different worlds?</p><p></p><p>To find a solution to these problems, Plato split the world into two: the material, or phyiscal, realm and the transcendent, or mental, realm of forms. We have access to the realm of forms through the mind, allowing us access to an unchanging world. This particular world is invulnerable to the pains and changes of the material world. By detaching our souls from the material world and our bodies and developing our ability to concern ourselves with the forms, Plato believes this will lead to us finding a value which is not open to change. This solves the ethical problem. Splitting existence up into two realms also leads us to a solution to the problem of permanence and change. Our mind perceives a different world, with different objects, than our senses do. It is the material world, perceived through the senses, that is changing. It is the realm of forms, perceived through the mind, that is permanent.</p><p></p><p>Aristotle, student of Plato, lived from 384 BC-322 BC. At eighteen, he joined Plato’s Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven. There, he honed his talents of understanding the world. In his understanding of the world, he wrote his theory of the universals–which I find to be extremely intriguing. The problem of the universals is the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what exactly are they.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Socrates (c. 469 - 399 B.C.) was a hugely important Greek philosopher from the Classical period (often known as the Socratic period in his honor). Unlike most of the Pre-Socratic philosophers who came before him, who were much more interested in establishing how the world works, Socrates was more concerned with how people should behave, and so was perhaps the first major philosopher of Ethics. An enigmatic figure known to us only through other people's accounts (principally the dialogues of his student Plato), he is credited as one of the founders of Western Philosophy. He is considered by some as the very antithesis of the Sophists of his day, who claimed to have knowledge which they could transmit to others (often for payment), arguing instead that knowledge should be pursued for its own sake, even if one could never fully possess it. He made important and lasting contributions in the fields of Ethics, Epistemology and Logic, and particularly in the methodology of philosophy (his Socratic Method or  'elenchus '). His views were instrumental in the development of many of the major philosophical movements and schools which came after him, including Platonism (and the Neo-Platonism and Aristotelianism it gave rise to), Cynicism, </p><br />

Socrates was also seen as a great philosopher and, as his pupil, Plato was greatly influenced by his teachings. Plato then became the teacher of Aristotle who, although a long-term pupil, was able to find many faults in Plato’s theories and in fact became a great critic of his teacher. Despite his criticisms though, Aristotle was influenced by Plato, making their works, which target the same aspects of philosophy, easily comparable.</p><br />

                            21. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle</h2><br />
                        :<br />Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC and lasted through the Hellenistic period (323 BC-30 BC). Greek philosophy covers an absolutely enormous amount of topics including: political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology (the study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality), logic, biology, rhetoric, and aesthetics (branch of philosophy dealing with art, beauty, and taste). Greek philosophy is known for its undeniable influence on Western thought. Although there were Greek philosophers before their respective births, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are the only three worth focusing on during this period.<br /><br />Socrates, born in Athens in 470 BC, is often credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy. The cloud of mystery surrounding his life and philosophical viewpoints propose a problem; a problem so large that it’s given a name itself: The Socratic Problem. Since he did not write philosophical texts, all knowledge related to him is entirely dependent on the writings of other people of the time period. Works by Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, and Aristophanes contain all of the knowledge known about this enigmatic figure. His largest contribution to philosophy is the Socratic method. The Socratic method is defined as a form of inquiry and discussion between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to illuminate ideas. This method is performed by asking question after question with the purpose of seeking to expose contradictions in one’s thoughts, guiding him/her to arrive at a solid, tenable conclusion. The principle underlying the Socratic Method is that humans learn through the use of reasoning and logic; ultimately finding holes in their own theories and then patching them up.<br /><br />Plato, student of Socrates, also has mystery surrounding him. His birth day is estimated to fall between 428 BC and 423 BC. He’s known for being the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. My favorite of Plato’s contributions to philosophy, and the one I’m going to focus on, is the Theory of Forms. This theory was created to solve two problems, one of ethics and one of permanence and change. The ethical problem is: how can humans live a fulfilling life in an ever changing world if everything that they hold close to them can be easily taken away? The problem dealing with permanence and change is: How can the world appear to be both permanent and changing? The world we perceive through senses seems to be always changing–which is a pretty clear observation. The world that we perceive through the mind, seems to be permanent and unchanging.<br /><br />To find a solution to these problems, Plato split the world into two: the material, or phyiscal, realm and the transcendent, or mental, realm of forms. We have access to the realm of forms through the mind, allowing us access to an unchanging world. This particular world is invulnerable to the pains and changes of the material world. By detaching our souls from the material world and our bodies and developing our ability to concern ourselves with the forms, Plato believes this will lead to us finding a value which is not open to change. This solves the ethical problem. Splitting existence up into two realms also leads us to a solution to the problem of permanence and change. Our mind perceives a different world, with different objects, than our senses do. It is the material world, perceived through the senses, that is changing. It is the realm of forms, perceived through the mind, that is permanent.<br /><br />Aristotle, student of Plato, lived from 384 BC-322 BC. At eighteen, he joined Plato’s Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven. There, he honed his talents of understanding the world. In his understanding of the world, he wrote his theory of the universals–which I find to be extremely intriguing. The problem of the universals is the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what exactly are they. To avoid confusion, a universal is a metaphysical term describing what particular things have in common, focusing strictly characteristics or qualities. His theory states that universals exist only where they are instantiated (the concept that it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object). In simpler terms, he believes universals exist only in things, never apart from things–differing from his teacher, Plato, on this. Aristotle believes that a universal is identical in each of its instances. All round things are similar in that there is the same universal, characteristic, throughout.<br /><br />These three laid the foundations of many of the believes of the rest of the Western world. Philosophers such as John Locker and Descartes use the theories these brilliant minds brought forth in their own works. I’m very interested to read your opinions, specifically on the Plato theory.<br /><br />Hope its help <br />

Si Plato ay isang alagad ng Socrates at kalaunan ay nagpatuloy upang maitaguyod ang kanyang sariling akademya ng pilosopiya. Namatay si Plato noong 348 BC. Si Aristotle ay isang estudyante ni Plato sa kanyang akademya. Ang lahat ng mga ito ay kabilang sa parehong paaralan ng pag-iisip na nagsimula nang higit o mas kaunti sa Socrates. Hinahayaan maunawaan ang kanilang pilosopiya nang paisa-isa:
</p><p>
</p><p>Socrates &amp; Plato: Ang problema kay Socrates ay wala siyang tiyak na pilosopiya ng kanyang sarili, ni siya ay nagdidikta ng anuman sa sinuman. Ang pinakamahalagang kontribusyon ng Socrates ay ang kanyang dialectic na paraan ng pagtatanong, na naging pundasyon ng bato para sa pilosopiya ng kanluran. Halos bawat pag-unlad na ginawa sa larangan ng agham ay batay sa pamamaraang Sokratiko. Ang pamamaraan ay walang anuman kundi ang pagtatanong ng isang serye ng mga katanungan na may lohika at pag-iwas sa bawat hypothesis nang paisa-isa. Karamihan sa mga oras na tinalakay niya ang tungkol sa etika, birtud at katarungan gamit ang pamamaraang ito. Anuman ang nalalaman natin tungkol sa Socrates ay sa pamamagitan ng mga gawa ng kanyang mga alagad na "Plato" at "Xenophon". Bagaman ang karamihan sa mga mananalaysay at pilosopo ay sumasang-ayon sa mga akda ni Plato na pinakamahusay na naglalarawan kay Socrates. Si Plato ay kasinghusay sa panitikan bilang pilosopiya. Inilarawan niya ang Pilosopiya ng Socrates sa pamamagitan ng kanyang mga sinulat at extrapolates ito sa maraming mga okasyon upang isama ang kanyang sariling lasa. Samakatuwid napakahirap na paghiwalayin ang dalawa.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were Greek philosophers who made significant contributions to the field of ethics, particularly in the area of Virtue Ethics. Although they shared some similarities in their beliefs, there were also some significant differences.</p><p></p><p>Socrates believed that the pursuit of virtue was the most important goal in life. He argued that a virtuous person would naturally be happy and that virtue could be learned through a process of questioning and self-examination. For Socrates, virtue was not about following rules or laws but rather about developing a deep understanding of oneself and one's place in the world.</p><p></p><p>Plato, on the other hand, believed that virtue was an objective reality that existed outside of human experience. He argued that there were universal forms or ideals of virtue that humans should strive to emulate. According to Plato, the highest form of virtue was wisdom, which could only be achieved through the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the world.</p><p></p><p>Aristotle, who was a student of Plato, developed his own version of Virtue Ethics. He believed that virtue was a habit or disposition to act in a certain way, rather than a set of rules or ideals. Aristotle argued that there were two types of virtues: intellectual virtues, which could be acquired through education and training, and moral virtues, which could only be developed through practice and habituation. For Aristotle, the highest form of virtue was practical wisdom, which involved using moral virtues to make the right choices in specific situations.</p><p></p><p>In summary, while Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle all believed that virtue was essential to a fulfilling life, they had different ideas about what virtue was and how it could be attained. Socrates emphasized self-examination and personal understanding, Plato focused on the pursuit of universal ideals, and Aristotle saw virtue as a habit that could be developed through practice and education.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: &lt;3</strong></p><p></p><br />
