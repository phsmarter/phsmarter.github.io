                                            Reality TV shows are good entertainment Reality shows are a very popular forma di entertainment on TV sodass These are dozens of different types of programmes such as gng contests. cooking competitions or going to live in the jungle. about Firstly, I think that there is a lot of variety in reality TV. People at home can choose which types of programme they want to watch depending on what they are interested in. Some people like watching, singang, or cooking competitions while others prefer watching programmes building houses or travelling around the world. In addition, reality TV programmes are a great opportunity to discover talented singers, dancers, or chefs. Several people who take part in these programmes get jobs as a results being on TV. Another advantage is that the people on the shows have interesting experiences and meet new people. On the other hand, some people think that reality TV is an easy way for them to become famous. However, most succesful singers, actors or chefs have worked hard all their lives and are good at their job because of their bardwork. Also, sometimes the people on the shows have to do really difficult or dangerous things. The competitions are very hard and there is only one winner. Another disadvantage is that some programmes always follow the same format and this can be boring to watch. To sum up, I think that reality TV is a good entertainment. There is a lot of variety which means there is something for everyone and they are interesting to watch. What is being talked about in the text? Do you agree/disagree with this?

Statistics show that inStates with capital punishment, murder rates are the same or almost the same as instates without capital punishment. It is also true that it is more expensive to put aperson on death row than in life imprisonment because of the costs of maximumsecurity. Unfortunately, capital punishment has been used unjustly. Statistics showthat every execution is of a man and that nine out of ten are black. So prejudiceshows right through2. Sunday is my favorite day of the week. I like it because on Sunday, I watch footballOn the other days, I also get to watch football but not all day. There are other sportson other days to watch on TV. Sunday lunch is a favorite of mine because I eat withmy father in front of the TV. Some days my dad doesn't make it home from workuntil after I'm in bed. Some weeks my dad travels, and I don't see him for severaldays. The highlight of the day is when we watch the Dolphins play Dad and I get soexcited, we yell and cheer together.

Mr. Sweet always made the narrator feel special. Sheloved to be around him and was overjoyed whenever he would visit her. Mr Sweetplayed with the children just as if he were a child himself. Mr. Sweet also displayed agreat deal of respect for the narrator and her family. Even though his alcoholism andlifestyle was a bad influence on the children, his virtues far outweighed his faults. MrSweet had a positive impact on the children that would last their entire lives. He wascompassionate, caring and honest, and the children learned to respect themselvesand others form their experiences with Mr. Sweet. He also inspired the children tosucceed. Mr. Sweet's lifestyle did not make him an excellent role model for thechildren, but he was always an excellent companion.The motive of the fictional autobiographers of Charlotte Bronte's novels must havebeen to "sum" and existence, "bound" a life, and find safety in the "strait limits" of anenclosed mind. Because all three autobiographers, William Crimsworth, Jane Eyreand Lucy Snowe, seem to need oversimplify both their own natures and the worldsin which they live in. They are all different, however, they go and do it in basically thesame way! Repressing what her more instinctual impulses tell her about the complextruths of experience, this is how they generate personal mythologies by which torationalize their lives.Club Palm Resort's isolation created dissatisfaction among some vacationers.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                            5. Reality TV shows are good entertainment Reality shows are a very popular forma di entertainment on TV sodass These are dozens of different types of programmes such as gng contests. cooking competitions or going to live in the jungle. about Firstly, I think that there is a lot of variety in reality TV. People at home can choose which types of programme they want to watch depending on what they are interested in. Some people like watching, singang, or cooking competitions while others prefer watching programmes building houses or travelling around the world. In addition, reality TV programmes are a great opportunity to discover talented singers, dancers, or chefs. Several people who take part in these programmes get jobs as a results being on TV. Another advantage is that the people on the shows have interesting experiences and meet new people. On the other hand, some people think that reality TV is an easy way for them to become famous. However, most succesful singers, actors or chefs have worked hard all their lives and are good at their job because of their bardwork. Also, sometimes the people on the shows have to do really difficult or dangerous things. The competitions are very hard and there is only one winner. Another disadvantage is that some programmes always follow the same format and this can be boring to watch. To sum up, I think that reality TV is a good entertainment. There is a lot of variety which means there is something for everyone and they are interesting to watch. What is being talked about in the text? Do you agree/disagree with this?

Statistics show that inStates with capital punishment, murder rates are the same or almost the same as instates without capital punishment.

Mr. Sweet also displayed agreat deal of respect for the narrator and her family. Even though his alcoholism andlifestyle was a bad influence on the children, his virtues far outweighed his faults. MrSweet had a positive impact on the children that would last their entire lives. He wascompassionate, caring and honest, and the children learned to respect themselvesand others form their experiences with Mr. Sweet. He also inspired the children tosucceed. Mr. Sweet's lifestyle did not make him an excellent role model for thechildren, but he was always an excellent companion.The motive of the fictional autobiographers of Charlotte Bronte's novels must havebeen to "sum" and existence, "bound" a life, and find safety in the "strait limits" of anenclosed mind. Because all three autobiographers, William Crimsworth, Jane Eyreand Lucy Snowe, seem to need oversimplify both their own natures and the worldsin which they live in. They are all different, however, they go and do it in basically thesame way! Repressing what her more instinctual impulses tell her about the complextruths of experience, this is how they generate personal mythologies by which torationalize their lives.Club Palm Resort's isolation created dissatisfaction among some vacationers.

This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
