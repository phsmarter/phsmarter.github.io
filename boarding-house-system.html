Used inmyriad applications, including ATM machines, retail point-of-sale terminals, car navigation and industrial controls. The touch screen became wildly popular for smart phones and tablets.3.__________ A device used to store files and capable of transferring files to the computer.4.__________The main circuit board of a computer. It contains all the circuits and componentsthat run the computer.5._________ The processor is the main “brain” or “heart” of a computer system. It performs all of the instructions and calculations that are needed and manages the flow of information through a computer.6._________ It (internal storage, main memory or memory) is the computer's working storage space that holds data, instructions for processing and processed data (information) waiting to be sent to secondary storage. Physically, primary storage is a collection of RAM chips.7._________ (Random Access Memory) RAM is volatile, meaning it holds data only when the power is on. When the power is off, RAM's contents are lost.8._________ Printed-circuit boards (also called interface cards) that enable the computer to use a peripheral device for which it does not have the necessary connections or circuit boards. They are often used to permit upgrading to a new different hardware.9._________ Installed in the back corner of the PC case, next to the motherboard. It converts 120vac (standard house power) into DC voltages that are used by other components in the PC.10_________ Also known as hard drive, is a magnetic storage device that is installed inside the computer. The hard drive is used as permanent storage for data. In a Windows computer, the hard drive is usually configured as the C: drive and contains the operating system and applications.​</h2><br />
