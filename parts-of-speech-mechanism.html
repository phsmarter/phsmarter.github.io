                                            Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne "...We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes." A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master. "Monsieur is going to leave home?" "Yes," returned Phileas Fogg. "We are going round the world." Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment. "Round the world!" he murmured. "In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose." "But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head from right to left. "We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We'll buy our clothes on the way.

Make haste!" Passepartout mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke, then? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all, Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt-but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto! By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg. What do you think it means? What were your clues?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.THE STOMACH muscles churn and mix the food with digestive juices that have acids and enzymes, breaking it into much smaller, digestible pieces.</p><p>2. THE SKELETAL SYSTEM provides mechanical support; stores minerals and produce red blood cells​.</p><p>3.THE INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM protects the body's internal environment and stores fat. It is composed of skin, hair, nails, glands, and nerves.</p><p>4.BLOOD allows for transport of nutrients, wastes, water, and heat, and is also a conduit of communication between organ systems.</p><p>5.ENDOCRINE GLANDS secrete hormones into the bloodstream for the regulation of cellular activities. Endocrine glands belong to the ductless glands of the endocrine system. An endocrine system is a group of glands producing hormones.</p><p>6.THE LARYNX plays an essential role in human speech. During sound production, the vocal cords close together and vibrate as air expelled from the lungs passes between them.</p><p>7.BRONCHIAL TUBES (BRONCHUS). One tube goes into your right lung, and the other goes into your left lung. The bronchial tubes go into your lungs and keep branching off into smaller and smaller tubes until the sacs at the end called alveoli are reached.</p><p>8.Air enters the respiratory system through the nose and mouth and passes down the throat (pharynx) and through the voice box, or larynx. The entrance to the larynx is covered by a small flap of tissue (epiglottis) that automatically closes during swallowing, thus preventing food or drink from entering the airways.</p><p>9.Upon inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and flattens and the chest cavity enlarges. This contraction creates a vacuum, which pulls air into the lungs. Upon exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and returns to its domelike shape, and air is forced out of the lungs.</p><p>10.ALVEOLI,Gas exchange takes place in the millions of alveoli in the lungs and the capillaries that envelop them.

                            25. Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne "...We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes." A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master. "Monsieur is going to leave home?" "Yes," returned Phileas Fogg. "We are going round the world." Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment. "Round the world!" he murmured. "In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose." "But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head from right to left. "We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We'll buy our clothes on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, Word 1. overspread 2. returned 3. stupefied 4. carpet-bag 5. mackintosh 6. stout 7. native 8. chary 9. hitherto 10. wardrobes part of speech and some stout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!" Passepartout mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke, then? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all, Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt-but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto! By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg. What do you think it means? What were your clues?​</h2><br />
