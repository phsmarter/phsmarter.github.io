He simply recounts the story of a prince 'who escapes from the valley of happiness,' to search for perpetual bliss. However, he realizes that this kind of happiness does not exist (“Moral - Examples and Definition of Moral.” Literary Devices, May 28, 2017) ___________10.

The essence of structuralism is the belief that things cannot be understood in isolation, they have to be seen in thecontext of larger structures which contain them.5. Feminist criticism attempts to correct this balance by evaluating and combatung such attitudes-by questioning, forexample, why none of the characters in Shakespeare's play Othello ever challenge the right of a husband to murder a wife accused ofadultery.6. Gender Crrücism is originally an offshoot of feminist movements, gender criticism today includes a number ofapproaches, Including the so-called "masculinist approach recently advocated by poet Robert Bly.7. Like an essay, a critique uses a informal, academic writing style and has a clear structure, that is, an introduction, bodyand conclusion8. Critique is a genre of academic writing that briefly summarizes and critically evaluates a work or concept.9. Before you start writing, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the work that will be critiqued._10. Structuralism focused on how human behavior is determined by social, cultural and psychological structures.​</h2><br />
