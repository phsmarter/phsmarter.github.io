                                            Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs in the correct order to arrive at a persuasive essay. Write 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th on the space provided.            _____ Some people think that automatic hand dryers don‘t dry their hands as thoroughly as paper towels. People stand in front of the hand dryers for just a few seconds, and they are disappointed that their hands do not feel dry. However, studies have shown that when people dry their hands for at least 30 seconds, automatic dryers actually dry much better than paper towels. It is difficult to get every part of your hand dry using paper towels. The blast of air makes sure that your hands are completely dry… if you take a few extra seconds. _____In addition, if the school buys automatic hand dryers, we can save money that can be spent on more important things. I have noticed that there is a terrible waste of paper towels in the restrooms. Students continuously pull on the lever, dispensing towels that they do not really need. It is annoying to find the dispenser empty. Our custodian is called several times a day to bring in bundles of replacements, just because some kids are wasteful. All of these paper towels cost a lot of money. An automatic hand dryer cost costs approximately $500, with very little additional cost over time. On the other hand, paper towels can cost $25 a case, or about $500 a year, since we use about 20 cases each year.After just one year, it would pay for itself. If we installed automatic hand dryers, we would not waste paper towels, and it would save the school a ton of money._____First of all, the automatic hand dryer is very sanitary. Instead of pulling on a lever that has been touched by a large number of students, users can just stick their hands under the air dryer. No germs can get on them because there is nothing to touch. Just think how the attendance rate would improve. Kids wouldn‘t get sick from the germ-infested paper towel dispensers we now use at our school. This would keep kids‘ hands germ-free. _____Keeping kids healthy, saving money, and helping our school stay clean are strong reasons for installing automatic hand dryers. Every day that goes by without having them means that we are continuing to have problems in our restrooms because we are using paper towels. Let‘s install automatic hand dryers as good as possible! Testing the Quality of My Reasons - Sample Issue and Point of View: Automatic motion-sensing hand dryers should be used in all school restrooms. Weak Reasons (probably won‘t convince my audience).* They are fun to use.* They warm your hands on cold days. * They dry your hands quicker than paper towels._____Finally, our bathroom is a paper towel mess! There are always piles of paper towels on the floor. Sometimes the extras fall from the dispenser unused. Many times kids bunch their used towels into a ball and aim for a basket. But if they miss the target, the paper ball stays on the floor. Sometimes the towels are even tossed to the ceiling like spitballs. Paper towels leave so much litter in the restrooms that the restrooms are a mess—even before the end of the day!_____Although some people don‘t like using hand dryers in restrooms, it may actually be argued that the motion-sensing hand dryers are a practical alternative to paper towels. More and more businesses are investing in automatic hand dryers keep the restrooms cleaner. I believe that our school would benefit from investing in automatic motion-sensing hand dryers in all the restrooms.​​</a>

                                            Lyle wants to write an essay about how the government should cut back on some of its current expenditures on space exploration. He wants to acknowledge that NASA has made several achievements related to space exploration and that those achievements have played a significant role in boosting the morale of the country. He also wants to emphasize that space exploration is less significant than a host of everyday issues the country faces. He wants to suggest that redirecting some of the funds spent on space missions to fields such as education or medical research would be more beneficial to humanity. Given Lyle's ideas for his essay, which of the following is the best thesis statement?
A. 
Although space exploration is not a profitable venture, it is necessary for humanity to understand the universe.
B. 
Space exploration is a waste of money and resources, but NASA should continue to fund its next planned mission to Mars.
C. 
While it is not advisable to stop space exploration entirely, the government should prioritize spending on important issues where the benefits may be more tangible.
D. 
Space exploration acts like a magnet, pulling away both intellectual resources and the tax payer's dollars only to produce inconsequential results.
E. 
Before trying to unravel the mysteries of space, we should learn about our own planet.</a>

A man who has a goodmanner does not hurt the feelings of others, and therefore he is on good terms with his friends andneighbors and also with others. In this way he helps to keep peace in society.But a man whose manners are bad has no respect for others. He uses words carelessly andbehaves rudely towards other and causes a lot of ill-will and unpleasantness. In the end, it is himselfwho suffers the most. Everyone avoids him and he is forced to live in isolation.To live well in society, money alone is not enough. We should also have good manners, for it ishuman nature to seek friendship, and friendship cannot be bought with money.

Write 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th, 5th and 6th on the space provided.            _____ Some people think that automatic hand dryers don‘t dry their hands as thoroughly as paper towels. People stand in front of the hand dryers for just a few seconds, and they are disappointed that their hands do not feel dry. However, studies have shown that when people dry their hands for at least 30 seconds, automatic dryers actually dry much better than paper towels. It is difficult to get every part of your hand dry using paper towels. The blast of air makes sure that your hands are completely dry… if you take a few extra seconds. _____In addition, if the school buys automatic hand dryers, we can save money that can be spent on more important things. I have noticed that there is a terrible waste of paper towels in the restrooms. Students continuously pull on the lever, dispensing towels that they do not really need. It is annoying to find the dispenser empty. Our custodian is called several times a day to bring in bundles of replacements, just because some kids are wasteful. All of these paper towels cost a lot of money. An automatic hand dryer cost costs approximately $500, with very little additional cost over time. On the other hand, paper towels can cost $25 a case, or about $500 a year, since we use about 20 cases each year.After just one year, it would pay for itself. If we installed automatic hand dryers, we would not waste paper towels, and it would save the school a ton of money._____First of all, the automatic hand dryer is very sanitary. Instead of pulling on a lever that has been touched by a large number of students, users can just stick their hands under the air dryer. No germs can get on them because there is nothing to touch. Just think how the attendance rate would improve. Kids wouldn‘t get sick from the germ-infested paper towel dispensers we now use at our school. This would keep kids‘ hands germ-free. _____Keeping kids healthy, saving money, and helping our school stay clean are strong reasons for installing automatic hand dryers. Every day that goes by without having them means that we are continuing to have problems in our restrooms because we are using paper towels. Let‘s install automatic hand dryers as good as possible! Testing the Quality of My Reasons - Sample Issue and Point of View: Automatic motion-sensing hand dryers should be used in all school restrooms. Weak Reasons (probably won‘t convince my audience).* They are fun to use.* They warm your hands on cold days. * They dry your hands quicker than paper towels._____Finally, our bathroom is a paper towel mess! There are always piles of paper towels on the floor. Sometimes the extras fall from the dispenser unused. Many times kids bunch their used towels into a ball and aim for a basket. But if they miss the target, the paper ball stays on the floor. Sometimes the towels are even tossed to the ceiling like spitballs. Paper towels leave so much litter in the restrooms that the restrooms are a mess—even before the end of the day!_____Although some people don‘t like using hand dryers in restrooms, it may actually be argued that the motion-sensing hand dryers are a practical alternative to paper towels. More and more businesses are investing in automatic hand dryers keep the restrooms cleaner. I believe that our school would benefit from investing in automatic motion-sensing hand dryers in all the restrooms.​​</h2><br />

For example, you can look at the gender variable, where the grouping is generally only into two, namely male  and female which are coded 1 and 2.</p><p> The number only serves as a category label, without having a numeric value like a true number.  These numbers do not have the same properties as numbers in general, so that on variables with a nominal scale, mathematical operations such as subtraction, addition, multiplication, etc. cannot be applied.</p><p> 2. <strong>Ordinal scale</strong></p><p> The ordinal scale is one type of measurement scale where the number symbols of the measurement results are in the form of a sequence or level.  Appropriate statistical tests are mode, median, frequency distribution and non-parametric statistics such as rank order correlation.</p><p> 3. <strong>Interval Scale</strong></p><p> Is a type of measurement scale that has characteristics similar to the ordinal scale, which has a certain order.  Another characteristic inherent in the interval scale is the existence of a scale unit.  Appropriate statistical tests are all statistical tests except those that are based on ratios such as the coefficient of variation.</p><p> 4. <strong>Ratio scale</strong></p><p> Ratio scale is a type of measurement scale that produces data of the highest quality.  The difference between the ratio scale and the interval scale lies in the presence of a zero value (based value).  On a ratio scale, zero is absolute, unlike on an interval scale.  The data generated by the ratio scale is ratio data.
