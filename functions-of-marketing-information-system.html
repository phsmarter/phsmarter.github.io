                                            REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a member of the advisory board, I would suggest the following redesigns to increase communication and collaboration across departments, and improve curriculum integration for students in all areas of study:</p><p></p><p>1. Cross-functional teams: Encourage the creation of cross-functional teams that bring together faculty members from different departments to work on common projects or initiatives. This will help break down silos between departments and encourage collaboration.</p><p></p><p>2. Interdisciplinary courses: Develop interdisciplinary courses that require students from different departments to work together on projects or case studies. This will help students see the connections between different business functions and develop a more holistic view of the business world.</p><p></p><p>3. Shared teaching and research spaces: Encourage the creation of shared teaching and research spaces that can be used by faculty members from different departments. This will facilitate informal communication and collaboration between faculty members.</p><p></p><p>4. Joint faculty appointments: Consider joint faculty appointments between departments. This will help break down departmental barriers and encourage collaboration between faculty members.</p><p></p><p>5. Curriculum integration: Work to integrate the curriculum across different departments. For example, accounting courses could include more information on marketing or management, and marketing courses could include more information on finance or accounting. This will help students develop a more well-rounded understanding of business.</p><p></p><p>By implementing these redesigns, the business school can encourage greater collaboration between departments, and provide students with a more integrated and well-rounded business education.</p><br />

                            10. REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.
