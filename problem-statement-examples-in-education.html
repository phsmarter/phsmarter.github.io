Complete the table by writing thestatements that fall under fact, judgement and actionThe K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providingsufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, producelifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurshipand employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added twoyears of Senior High School (SHS) The courses that can be learned from SHS includeaccounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary andhospitality workAlthough the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there isstil a mismatch between our schooling system and working system As regards theimplementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materialsprovided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materialsfor one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack ofsufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem.Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers aswell. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with theimplementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016.Despite these observations, Department of Education (DEPED) is optimistic that theseshortages and problems will overcame as they claim that these are being addressedMeanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) laudeDepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its Chairman, additional twoyears of education should not be seen as a burden.(Barrot, 2016, p. 92)FACTJUDGEMENTACTION​pa helpp!</a>
