                                            Martina is a seamstress. She has worked in the garment manufacturing industry since shedropped from college. After a few years, she decided to resign from the factory to beself-employed. She set up a small shop in their house where she accepted sewing jobs fromfriends and relatives. During the first few months of her shop, she did all the work by herself.She purchased the fabrics directly from the wholesalers to minimize the cost and to ensurethat she would get the best designs with the best quality. After purchasing the fabric, shewould lay the pattern carefully to ensure that the grainline is parallel with the selvage toefficiently use the fabric. The next thing she would do was to mark the pattern on paper, andthen she would fix it to the fabric using pins and adhesives. After that, she would cut thefabric manually, then sew it based on the pattern. She would then package the finishedproduct and wait for the customer to pick it up after a few days.Since she produced high-quality outputs, she became popular in the area. Hence, she gainedmore customers. Her work increased from two to five dresses per week, so she decided tohire a new seamstress. Together, they were able to produce eight to ten clothes per weekwith a total of 40 per month. They barely had any sleep to produce this number of clothes, asthey had to work day in, day out to finish on time. Thus, Martina decided to hire three moreworkers. All five of them had to do all the process to finish a product. They had a great team.With Martina as the leader, it seems like they were a family rather than co-workers since theycommunicated informally, and there was no rule or policies except that they were expectedto report on time and do the job excellently.As Martina’s business grew, she is now thinking of expanding their company’s size. She hiredyou to give her advice on this.            1. In the given scenario, what is the appropriate organizational structure design for
Martina, given that her business grew.2. Do you think that the number of employees Martina has is appropriate? Why or why
not?3. Is there standardization present in the organization? Why is it important in the said
case?4. Why would it be necessary for the organization to change its organizational
structure? Explain your answer.​</a>

                                            Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center. If you follow the three Rs - reduce, reuse, and recycle,you can help save the world's forests. varagraph.

                            13. Martina is a seamstress. She has worked in the garment manufacturing industry since shedropped from college. After a few years, she decided to resign from the factory to beself-employed. She set up a small shop in their house where she accepted sewing jobs fromfriends and relatives. During the first few months of her shop, she did all the work by herself.She purchased the fabrics directly from the wholesalers to minimize the cost and to ensurethat she would get the best designs with the best quality. After purchasing the fabric, shewould lay the pattern carefully to ensure that the grainline is parallel with the selvage toefficiently use the fabric. The next thing she would do was to mark the pattern on paper, andthen she would fix it to the fabric using pins and adhesives. After that, she would cut thefabric manually, then sew it based on the pattern. She would then package the finishedproduct and wait for the customer to pick it up after a few days.Since she produced high-quality outputs, she became popular in the area. Hence, she gainedmore customers. Her work increased from two to five dresses per week, so she decided tohire a new seamstress. Together, they were able to produce eight to ten clothes per weekwith a total of 40 per month. They barely had any sleep to produce this number of clothes, asthey had to work day in, day out to finish on time. Thus, Martina decided to hire three moreworkers. All five of them had to do all the process to finish a product. They had a great team.With Martina as the leader, it seems like they were a family rather than co-workers since theycommunicated informally, and there was no rule or policies except that they were expectedto report on time and do the job excellently.As Martina’s business grew, she is now thinking of expanding their company’s size. She hiredyou to give her advice on this.            1. In the given scenario, what is the appropriate organizational structure design for
Martina, given that her business grew.2. Do you think that the number of employees Martina has is appropriate? Why or why
not?3. Is there standardization present in the organization? Why is it important in the said
case?4. Why would it be necessary for the organization to change its organizational
structure? Explain your answer.​</h2><br />

                            19. Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center. If you follow the three Rs - reduce, reuse, and recycle,you can help save the world's forests. varagraph.

                            30. TRUE OR FALSE (10pts) Directions: Read and identify the following statements. Write T if the statement is correct and D if otherwise. 1. Assembly and subassembly drawings are two different things. 2. Assembly Drawing made faster CAD design because the same sub-assembly can be inserted several times into the main assembly. 3. Assembly Drawing shows the relationship of two or more parts of an item when assembled 4. Assembly drawings are very helpful to machine assemblers 5. Assembly drawings include main BOM than can contain all the parts for the whole machine. 6. Assembly model checking time in the assembly drawing is prolonged because each sub-assembly must be checked one by one. 7. It is easier to job out parts of the fixture to be made by contractors or machine shops thru assembly drawings8. Manufacturers that build products start the assembly process by creating a BOM. 9. Sub-assembly Drawings is also known as Unit assembly 10. Sub-assembly is a part of much larger assembly.​</h2><br />
