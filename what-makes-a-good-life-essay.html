Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.

Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great.

This could help ease that heavy feeling in your chest. Second, do physical activities. This can be activities like exercise or any sport. Third, talk to someone about your feeling. Talking will be a big help in easing out your anger.​​</a>

                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                                            The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

                                            Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</a>

</p><p>
</p><p>The 7 year old me going with Dad to a swimming pool. It was just him and I that went and so we arrived and settled down. Went down with Dad into the swimming pool and he aided me in swimming. Had a good swim, really enjoyed it, went out of the pool for a break and Dad had to go do something, asking me to remain in place and not to go anywhere. I was a good boy and I obeyed his instructions. However not this time, I had the urge to go back swimming again. Without my Dad's supervision, I entered the water slowly, submerged in the water, heads up, hands stretching out to the sides of the pool for support. So I started moving my hands, one by one, by the side of the pool, forth and back several times. I did so until I was confident (for no logical reason) that I am able to swim without any support, just by randomly flapping my arms and legs I'll do fine. I pushed away from the side of the pool completely unaware of the consequences (1.5 meters deep, no life vest, absolutely inexperienced in swimming). Randomly moving my limbs, vigorously, confident that I'll be able to keep my head above the surface; I did, for a few seconds and inevitably found myself drowning. Lucky enough to take a breath without swallowing water, held my breath and submerged. The surprising thing is that I had no feelings of fear, shock or whatsoever. I felt calm, so calm that I didn't resistant fighting back to the surface. My head was up throughout the time I was sinking, sinking slowly. I can still remember how that as if it was as if I felt safe, not worried about dying, as if accepting faith. I still didn't feel that I was running out of breath throughout the time, it was a miracle that I didn't for at least half a minute. A man was passing by and from his point of view he noticed a young figure submerged under the water, aware that this kid might actually need help. Feeling pity, he reached his hand into the water and I have seen the hand reach out to me as it grabs me and pulls me out to the light. I don't remember what happened next but the man was my Dad, breaking down into tears after discovering that he rescued and saved me by chance, having no idea it was me.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?

                            11. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                            13. The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

                            20. Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</h2><br />

                            22. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war? In times of peace? 7-10. Make believe that you are one of the following: (a. teacher b. policeman c. doctor d. businessman) How can you show that you are a true Filipino in terms of solving community and national problems? ​</h2><br />
