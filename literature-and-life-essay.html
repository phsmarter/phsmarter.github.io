                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To write is to forget. Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life. Music soothes, the visual arts exhilarates, the performing arts (such as acting and dance) entertain. Literature, however, retreats from life by turning in into slumber. The other arts make no such retreat— some because they use visible and hence vital formulas, others because they live from human life itself.</p><p>This isn't the case with literature. Literature simulates life. A novel is a story of what never was, a play is a novel without narration. A poem is the expression of ideas or feelings a language no one uses, because no one talks in verse.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a lover of literature, I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that "literature adds reality." Literature has the unique ability to transport readers to different worlds, times, and experiences, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the complexities and nuances of human life.</p><p></p><p>But literature does more than just provide a temporary escape from reality. It also helps us to better understand and navigate the reality we live in. Through literature, we encounter diverse perspectives and ideas that broaden our understanding of the world and the people around us. We learn about different cultures, histories, and ways of life that we may not have been exposed to otherwise.</p><p></p><p>In this way, literature enriches the competencies that daily life requires. It helps us to develop empathy, critical thinking, and communication skills, as well as a greater awareness and understanding of the world. These are all essential skills that we rely on in our personal and professional lives.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, literature has the power to bring beauty and meaning to our lives, especially in times when life may feel mundane or monotonous. It can provide solace and comfort during difficult times, and offer new ways of looking at the world that can inspire and uplift us. In this sense, literature can "inigate the deserts" of our lives, bringing new life and vitality to our daily experiences.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, literature adds reality in a multitude of ways. It expands our understanding of the world and the people around us, enriches the competencies we need to navigate daily life, and brings beauty and meaning to our lives. Whether we are lost in a captivating novel or studying a classic work of literature, the power of literature to enrich and deepen our reality is undeniable.</p><p></p><p><strong> If you have any other questions,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>just </strong><strong>let </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>know</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>narin </strong><strong>ty</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

                            30.  This is simple and I believe you can do this! Poet Fernando Pessoa once said that "Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life." Write an essay where you explain your reasons for agreeing, or not agreeing, with the quote above.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>„To write is to forget. Literature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life. Music soothes, the visual arts exhilarates, the performing arts (such as acting and dance) entertain. Literature, however, retreats from life by turning in into slumber. The other arts make no such retreat— some because they use visible and hence vital formulas, others because they live from human life itself. This isn't the case with literature. Literature simulates life. A novel is a story of what never was, a play is a novel without narration. A poem is the expression of ideas or feelings a language no one uses, because no one talks in verse.“</p><p></p><br />
