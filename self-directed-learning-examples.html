                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Energy is transferred between trophic levels when one organism eats another and gets the energy-rich molecules from its prey's body. However, these transfers are inefficient, and this inefficiency limits the length of food chains.</p><p></p><p>2. biogeochemical cycle are found everywhere around us.</p><p></p><p>Many biogeochemical cycles affect our daily lives in many ways. A prime example of one of these cycles is the water cycle. The constant changing states of water and how it interacts with our environment ( both gas, ice, and liquid states). Some key words with the water cycle include condensation, precipitation, and evaporation</p><p></p><p>Another great example in our everyday lives is the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The constant respiration from animals and photosynthesis from plants creates a constant cycle which has been continuing for millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Other cycles include the nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and sulfur cycle. Even today scientists are beginning to discover new cycles such as weather patterns, and human impact on the environment, which can drastically change the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles.</p><p></p><p>3. A biogeochemical cycle is a process where a type of element moves through nature. An element moves through nature by the break down and build up of molecules the element is a part of. To give an example, think about carbon. Carbon is present in gaseous CO2 in the atmosphere. Vegetation sequesters CO2 through photosynthesis. Plants turn CO2 into sugars to store energy absorbed by the sun. These sugars are then stored by the plant for later catabolic purpose.</p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning<br />
