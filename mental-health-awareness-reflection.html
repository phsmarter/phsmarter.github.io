                                            Portfolio Output 1: "My Diary” Instruction: During these pandemic times, I have actively volunteered in some non-profit organizations to help people, specifically in checking their mental health by providing tele-counseling while they are experiencing quarantine. Às many of my clients encounter new experiences." ivost of them do experience changes in their views, beliefs, including the stress that piles up in their head. In our non-profit organization, we tend to provide our digital consumers ways to cope with this "new normal” in our society. One of which is keeping a simple diary. During the time of Sigmund Freud (1944), keeping a Diary is one of the oldest methods for collecting data about the individual's personality. In my field as a practicing psychologist, I sometimes suggest that my students have a personal diary to record their behavior, thinking, and experiences, no matter how absurd their experiences are. In this way, I let my students be aware of their surroundings, their decisions and themselves. As our lesson implies, knowing the "selt" starts when we exercise the awareness of our identity. In this portfolio, you are tasked to have your own simple personal diary. Below is a format that you should follow to start the daily writing/recording of your diary. Your front cover may be a reflection of what you want to be. In doing so, you are free to create your own front cover. You may use any available writing material for this. This personal diary is to be sustained until the end of the subject course. Also, this must be submitted on the last day of the semester as one of the prerequisites in passing the subject.​</a>

An interview with John Moe (writer, humorist,
and National Public Radio host ) on the
pandemic and mental health
The percentage of people reporting symptoms of
depression, and a disorder level of depression is way up,
John emphasizes, and this does not show signs of
decreasing anytime soon.
“There’s this concept I read about called the
bereavement multiplier, where for every person who dies
of COVID-19, there are on average nine people in their
immediate family who will be grieving. If you take that
number and multiply it times the number of people who
have died, you have millions of people feeling stuck,
missing work, and not functioning at their best.”
John thinks that trauma, which is “completely under-
recognized as a source for mental disorders” explains the
rapidly increasing numbers of people experiencing mental
illness during the pandemic. He believes this influx of new
cases will put a tremendous strain on a mental health
care system that is already ill-equipped to receive them
and tells us that “there are parts of the country where
there’s barely any health professionals for the number of
people who live there.”
Along with bringing much-needed awareness to this
problem, John feels that some sort of system needs to be
put into place to effectively treat the growing amount of
people experiencing mental illness. He feels this can only
happen when there is proper representation of mental
health professionals on the White House Council on
Coronavirus.

                            6. Portfolio Output 1: "My Diary” Instruction: During these pandemic times, I have actively volunteered in some non-profit organizations to help people, specifically in checking their mental health by providing tele-counseling while they are experiencing quarantine. Às many of my clients encounter new experiences." ivost of them do experience changes in their views, beliefs, including the stress that piles up in their head. In our non-profit organization, we tend to provide our digital consumers ways to cope with this "new normal” in our society. One of which is keeping a simple diary. During the time of Sigmund Freud (1944), keeping a Diary is one of the oldest methods for collecting data about the individual's personality. In my field as a practicing psychologist, I sometimes suggest that my students have a personal diary to record their behavior, thinking, and experiences, no matter how absurd their experiences are. In this way, I let my students be aware of their surroundings, their decisions and themselves. As our lesson implies, knowing the "selt" starts when we exercise the awareness of our identity. In this portfolio, you are tasked to have your own simple personal diary. Below is a format that you should follow to start the daily writing/recording of your diary. Your front cover may be a reflection of what you want to be. In doing so, you are free to create your own front cover. You may use any available writing material for this. This personal diary is to be sustained until the end of the subject course. Also, this must be submitted on the last day of the semester as one of the prerequisites in passing the subject.​</h2><br />

The percentage of people reporting symptoms of
depression, and a disorder level of depression is way up,
John emphasizes, and this does not show signs of
decreasing anytime soon.
“There’s this concept I read about called the
bereavement multiplier, where for every person who dies
of COVID-19, there are on average nine people in their
immediate family who will be grieving. If you take that
number and multiply it times the number of people who
have died, you have millions of people feeling stuck,
missing work, and not functioning at their best.”
John thinks that trauma, which is “completely under-
recognized as a source for mental disorders” explains the
rapidly increasing numbers of people experiencing mental
illness during the pandemic. He believes this influx of new
cases will put a tremendous strain on a mental health
care system that is already ill-equipped to receive them
and tells us that “there are parts of the country where
there’s barely any health professionals for the number of
people who live there.”
Along with bringing much-needed awareness to this
problem, John feels that some sort of system needs to be
put into place to effectively treat the growing amount of
people experiencing mental illness. He feels this can only
happen when there is proper representation of mental
health professionals on the White House Council on
Coronavirus.
