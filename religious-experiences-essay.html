A cry for freedom was underscored in various patriotic literary output from different regions of our country 2. Most common forms of oral literature like the riddle, the proverbs and the song, always seem to assume that the audience is familiar with the situations, activities and objects mentioned in the course of expressing a thought or emotion. 3. New literary forms such as free verse ſin poetryl, the modern short story and the critical essay were introduced. 4. It was deeply entrenched with the firm establishment of English as the medium of instruction in all schools and with literary modernism that highlighted the writer's individuality and cultivated consciousness of craft, sometimes at the expense of social consciousness. 5. The Filipino writer has become more conscious of his art with the proliferation of writer's workshops here and abroad and the bulk of literature available to him via the mass media including the internet. 6. Literature in this period may be classified as religious prose and poetry and secular prose and poetry. 7. While the early Filipino poets grappled with the verities of the new language, Filipinos seemed to have taken easily to the modern short story. 8.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Our experiences, environment and even genetics form our beliefs and attitudes. In turn, these beliefs influence our behaviour, and determine our actions. Beliefs that are widely accepted become part of our culture and, in many ways, shape the society we live in.</p><p></p><p>Religion is probably the strongest belief system that has existed for thousands of years. In many ways, it is a code of conduct, a rule book that allows believers to function in a non-primitive or cultured manner. The earliest forms of religion were established to facilitate social bonding. In fact, it is also believed that religious practices are adaptive and have emerged to sustain survival and reproductive advantages through gene selection or gene-culture coevolution dynamics.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>It is no surprise then, that this system is crucial to thinking patterns and plays a vital role in formation of self-identity and a collective identity of a community, which then shapes attitudes, cultural norms and influences individual and group behaviour. Children are particularly perceptive to religious beliefs and the concepts of Gods and other supernatural agents, which leads to a teleological bias of accepting explanations of phenomenon, based on the purpose they serve rather than their postulated causes, which persist into adulthood (Kelemen, 2004). These attitudes are contingent upon factors such as beliefs about God's existence, immortality and omnipresence; attributions about psychological characteristics such as fairness, compassion and harshness; and attributions about God's causal involvement and motives in one's life events.   </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Most, if not all religions, have some thematic principles that make them similar to one another, namely concepts of god and love, honesty, altruism, miracle workings and peacekeeping. However, every religion has elements and ideologies that set them apart from the other. These ideological differences may not be overt and easy to discern, but they are present and account for a lot of disharmony and discord at times. This is mainly due to irrational and distorted deductions of religious scriptures by some followers which go against the fundamental principles. Moreover, coexistence of diverse religions in a single community or nation is a comparatively recent trend. Sacrifices and wars in the name of religion are not unheard of, with some of the significant examples being The Crusades, Sati System, Buddhist Burma, Jihadists and the Witch Hunt, which ended thousands of lives. What is even more mind-boggling is the dichotomous function that religion seems to serve, where it imbibes compassion and kindness towards all, but also instigates religious hatred, violence and religious martyrdoms, especially in radical believers.</p><p></p><p>Most religions enforce moral behaviour through positive and negative reinforcement by infusing ‘god-fearing’ elements in scriptures, such as the concept of karma and reincarnation in Hinduism, heaven-hell and salvation in Christianity, paradise and hell in Islamism, peaceful afterlife and reincarnation in indigenous Chinese folk religions, and release from the cycle of reincarnations and reaching enlightenment in Buddhism. This was further reiterated through Shariff and Norenzayan’s (2011) study where they found that individuals are more likely to behave in a moral or honest manner when they believe in fearsome and punishing supernatural agents. In their subsequent studies, they concluded that the concept of hell exists to make people act in a moral and ethical manner, whereas the concept of heaven (or its equivalent in other religions) exists to make people feel good, and has a direct and positive relation with happiness. However, another possible explanation for this suggests that it may have nothing to do with religious beliefs. Rather, the religious scriptures or rituals act as a moral reminder, through priming, and impel us to act in a moral and honest manner.<br /></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps po!!</p><br />

It was deeply entrenched with the firm establishment of English as the medium of instruction in all schools and with literary modernism that highlighted the writer's individuality and cultivated consciousness of craft, sometimes at the expense of social consciousness. 5. The Filipino writer has become more conscious of his art with the proliferation of writer's workshops here and abroad and the bulk of literature available to him via the mass media including the internet. 6. Literature in this period may be classified as religious prose and poetry and secular prose and poetry. 7. While the early Filipino poets grappled with the verities of the new language, Filipinos seemed to have taken easily to the modern short story. 8.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders.

It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
