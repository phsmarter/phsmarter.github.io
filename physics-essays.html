                        <br /><br />A physical change <br />.<br />is a type of change in which the form of matter is altered but one substance is not transformed into another. The size or shape of matter may be changed, but no chemical reaction occurs. Physical changes are usually reversible.<br />occur when objects or substances undergo a change that does not change their chemical composition. This contrasts with the concept of chemical change in which the composition of a substance changes or one or more substances combine or break up to form new substances.<br />The changes in which only physical properties of substances are changed and no new substance is formed is called a physical change. It is a reversible change. Example: Boiling and freezing of water.<br />The change of matter which occurs without changing its chemical composition is called a physical change. The physical change only affects the physical properties of the matter i.e size, shape, volume, density, state or colour. No new products are formed during the physical change of a matter.<br />.<br />#CarryOnLearning<br />#MarkMeAsBrainliest<br />#RateMyAnswer<br />#LikeMyAnswet<br />#ThankYou :)<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>I</strong><strong>mportance of physical education</strong></p><p></p><p>Physical education is a vital aspect of the general education system because it provides students with knowledge and experience concerning physical and mental wellness. The education system should encourage physical education to help students understand the importance of physical activity and provide them with opportunities for healthy development. Physical education is often viewed as less important than other fields of study, such as science, mathematics, or history. However, the benefits of physical education are undeniable.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant benefits of physical education is that it helps students maintain good physical health. Physical education teaches students about the importance of exercise and the effects of a sedentary lifestyle. It assists students in achieving developmental milestones and leads to stronger, healthier muscles, bones, and joints. It can also help individuals reduce the incidence of obesity and other health problems that result from a lack of physical activity.</p><p></p><p>Physical education also teaches students social and teamwork skills. It is an excellent avenue for young people to learn the art of communication, respect for others, and perseverance. It is also a way for students to experience camaraderie, learn how to participate in group activities, and work toward common goals. Physical education teaches students that being active involves more than just physical activity; it also promotes mental and emotional health.</p><p></p><p>Physical education strengthens the intellectual, psychological, and emotional development of students. Academic performance improves when students engage in physical activity; this is because physical activity enables the brain to work better, allowing the student to focus and learn more effectively. Physical activity also reduces stress, anxiety, and tension. Participating in physical education is an excellent way for students to reduce these psychological and emotional pressures, thereby enhancing their quality of life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, physical education leads to a more active and healthy lifestyle. The skills and knowledge developed through physical education can be applied to daily routines, which leads to a lifetime of healthy habits. The lessons and exercises that students learn in physical education classes lead to better decision-making regarding lifestyle choices, thus enabling them to adopt habits that promote an active and healthy lifestyle.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, physical education is an integral part of the education system because it provides students with skills and knowledge needed for their overall health and wellness. It reinforces the importance of physical activity, social skills, intellectual, psychological, and emotional development, leading to a more active and healthy society. Physical education offers invaluable resources for students and is essential for the holistic development of individuals.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        What is the physical self?Physical self-concept is the individual's perception of themselves in areas of physical ability and appearance. Physical ability includes concepts such as physical strength and endurance, while appearance refers to attractiveness.What is the importance of physical self?The physical self has been shown to be an important contributor to overarching global perceptions of self-worth in multidimensional, hierarchical models of self-esteem (Fox, 1997). The tenets of James and Harter on importance have at least in part been addressed within the physical domain.It is very hard for everyone to feel fully satisfied with every part of their body. Some physical characteristics are hard or even impossible to change. There are some of my physical appearance that has been bothering me for my entire life.

                        <p><strong>ANSWER :</strong></p><p><strong>( WHY BEING PHYSICALLY FIT CAN BE HEALTHY )</strong></p><p><strong> Health has been defined by WHO as the state of total wellbeing, of both the body and the mind. It is essential to understand that a perfect state of health is defined by many parameters. Some of which are physical, while others prefer a person’s emotional state.</strong></p><p><strong>Our health is our most valuable wealth. A healthy person is someone free from diseases and can perform physical activities without getting tired. A person’s physical fitness measures health and fitness. It can be achieved through proper nutrition and careful eating habits. Nutrition plays a vital role because we are what we eat. Health cannot be ignored because our body needs to be healthy to function correctly. Eating fruits and vegetables boosts one’s health. While eating junk food hurts our health. Regular exercises can help us to build a healthy and fit body that would be resistant to diseases.</strong></p><p><strong>A healthy body and mind are essential to achieve complete wellbeing. If we are healthy, we can resist our bodies from being attacked by germs. Our bodies are really sensitive and therefore, must be handled with necessary precautions. We can develop healthy habits like eating and sleeping on time to boost our overall health. This helps in becoming a healthier version of ourselves. Holistic growth can be achieved if we focus on all the aspects of our health. Such as nutrition, wellness, spirituality, and mental health. There are plenty of exercises that will boost our physical health and help us to become stronger. A stronger body would lead to less fatigue while performing any activity. It is advised that we must exercise for at least 2 hours every day for better health. We can even join fitness classes to take professional help and practice the art of health and wellness in a better way.
</strong></p><p><strong>A healthy person is physically fit. This perception has changed, and now people believe that a healthy person is mentally and physically fit. Mental health and physical health can be inter-related in some cases. A relaxed mind can be achieved by meditating, and meditation, in turn, has a positive impact on physical health. It should be noted that physical health is not measured by the shape or size of a person. Even a thin person can be healthier than someone fatter.  </strong></p><p><strong>The metabolism of the body is largely responsible for our health and fitness. A better metabolism would mean faster absorption of nutrients into our bodies. While a slower metabolism would mean a slower absorption of food. A higher metabolism rate can be achieved by keeping the body healthy. This is possible when we start taking care of our nutrition. Healthy nutrition is not only rich in vegetables and fruits, but it is balanced and has a moderate amount of everything in a balanced proportion. The key to a healthy body starts with the art of balancing our intake and being aware of what harms us and what is good for us.</strong></p><p><strong>Health can be defined as a holistic way of the growth of the human body and mind. A healthy person’s body is in complete harmony with his mind. We can practice the art of health and wellness by keeping in mind that our bodies are made from living tissues. Those tissues require nutrition to grow, and the food we eat is directly responsible for the nutrients that reach our tissues. Keeping that in mind, we must understand the importance of a balanced meal.</strong></p><p><strong>( that's all I can say )</strong></p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNING!</strong><p><strong>

Physical fitness has many benefits to the human body mentally, physically, and spiritually, it helps us form healthier habits such as daily physical activity, eating habits, and can reduce the chances of developing type 2 </p><br />
