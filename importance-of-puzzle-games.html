Learning the meaning of a word through its use in a sentence or paragraph is the most practical way to build vocabulary, as dictionaries are not always available when the reader encounters an unfamiliar word. Readers should be aware that many words can have multiple meanings. </p><p></p><p>Only by being sensitive to the context in which a word is used can the reader decide on an appropriate definition to fit the context. Readers should rely on contextual clues when providing a clear hint of meaning, or when just a general meaning is needed for the reader's purposes. Context clues should not be used when exact meaning is required when clues suggest multiple possible definitions, when nearby words are unfamiliar, and when the unfamiliar word is a common word that would be needed. Again; In these cases, a dictionary should be consulted.</p><p></p><p>Contextual cues come in a variety of forms. Among them are: </p>1. DEFINITION / DESCRIPTION CLUE<p>Definition or description clue number one A formal definition of the new phrase may be provided, or the context of the sentence or the sentence that follows may provide an adequate explanation. The phrase "that is," commas, dashes, and parentheses all serve as definitional hints.</p><p></p>2. EXAMPLE CLUES<p>When a reader comes across a new word, there may occasionally be an example nearby that clarifies what it means. Words that provide example clues include, such as, and for example.</p>3. SYNONYM RESTATEMENT CLUE<p>Because it reiterates a thought that is already communicated in close-by familiar terms, a word's meaning may become clear to the reader. Words with the same meaning are synonyms.</p><p></p>4. CONTRAST / ANTONYM CLUE<p>Words with opposing meanings are called antonyms. An opposite meaning context cue compares the meanings of two words, one of which is unfamiliar. However, but, however, and similar words may serve as contrast cues.</p><p></p>5. MOOD / TONE CLUE<p>The unknown word's definition must fit the tone that the author has created.</p><p></p>6. EXPERIENCE CLUE<p>On occasion, a reader is familiar with how certain things or people behave in a particular circumstance. This information offers the key to a word's meaning.</p><p></p>7. ANALYSIS OR STRUCTURE CLUE<p>A word's constituent parts may provide clear indications of its meaning. The use of this kind of context clue can be facilitated by a reader's familiarity with prefixes, roots, and suffixes. A reader's vocabulary can increase by dozens of words only by learning one word part. The strength of word parts resides in the capacity to synthesize the roots and affixes of a word with its context to ascertain the author's meaning.</p><p></p>8. INFERENCE CLUE<p>The observant reader may have access to enough hints to infer the meaning from the text.</p><p></p>9. CAUSE AND EFFECT CLUE<p>The author provides an explanation of the meaning of the word. Contextual cues may be indicated by words like "because," "because," "hence," "thus," "so," etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about context clues here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/8899065#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
