Governments will adopt a new set of Sustainable Development Goals, work together to draft a meaningful climate agreement, and craft a framework to provide the financial resources needed to deliver on a global sustainable development agenda. Those participating would be wise to remember that inclusive sustainable development can be realized only when all human rights – including gender equality – are protected, respected, and fulfilled.</p><br />

                            8. Essay about  present and future​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Past Present and Future
</p><p>
</p><p>Past present future covers hopes and dreams from my mother that carried over to me.
</p><p>It’s about my love for reading and learning leading me to my path and anchor in life. It’s about my children and husband being secure enough to support and push me to be better and to do better.
</p><p>Allowing me to do the same for them. It’s about giving me a platform and resources to
</p><p>Reach out and help others.
</p><p>
</p><p>My parents were married and started a family young sixteen and twenty three respectively. In actuality it felt like they had three sets of kids. I was in the second set. The first set of three Lisa, Barry and Sonya were born down south in Augusta Arkansas. They started the second set my sister Patrice and I shortly after arriving in Chicago. Making me the youngest of five children. There was so much space between me and my siblings that much of the time I felt like an only child. The times were different we were born in different eras. Our upbringing was different. Eventually I just ended up by myself. My sisters and brother were having kids of their own when I was eight. I have a nephew who’s more like a brother
</p><p>
</p><p>Later on when it was my time to graduate from high school my parents started the third set of kids. I have a sister that was born a month before I graduated, making her the youngest of six. I had my first child two years later.
</p><p>
</p><p>My educational experience was a little weird. I don’t remember learning much in school. My mom did a lot of home schooling and because of that when I started kindergarten I knew everything so I thought. I knew everything through eighth grade, making school easy for me. I believe it was a testament to my mom being the best teacher ever.
</p><p>As my mom learned I learned soaking it up likes a sponge. My mom only had a high school diploma but she never stopped reading, researching, and learning. Her hope was that her children would do better than her. I hope to fulfill that dream.
</p><p>
</p><p>My hobbies past present and most likely future are and will be the same. The vehicle is just different. My love of books is what saved me as a child. It helped me build my self-esteem. It taught me about the world when I had no hopes of seeing it. Learning is a hobby. When you unintentionally research and listen just for the fun of it every day. Reading and learning go hand in hand. My reading type is very eclectic fiction, nonfiction, romance mystery sci-fi and many more. When you are that open learning comes in many forms.
</p><p>
</p><p>My greatest achievement so far is first and foremost my marriage. It has withstood many of trials and tribulations. My husband Walter and I married very young in an age where people didn’t think it was possible to last this long. We were twenty and twenty-one and we’ve been married eighteen years with six children between us. We work very hard at it we try to communicate, date, vacations, surprises whatever is needed. My children are next I try to let them know “they are smart…

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Equality or non-discrimination is that state where every individual gets equal opportunities and rights. Every individual of the society yearns for equal status, opportunity, and rights. However, it is a general observation that there exists lots of discrimination between humans. Discrimination exists because of cultural differences, geographical differences, and gender. Inequality based on gender is a concern that is prevalent in the entire world.  Even in the 21st century, across globe men and women do not enjoy equal privileges. Gender equality means providing equal opportunities to both men and women in political, economic, education and health aspects.</p><p></p><p>A nation can progress and attain higher development growth only when both men and women are entitled to equal opportunities. Women in the society are often cornered and are refrained from getting equal rights as men to health, education, decision-making and economic independence in terms of wages.</p><p></p><p>The social structure that prevails since long in such a way that girls do not get equal opportunities as men. Women generally are the caregivers in the family. Because of this, women are mostly involved in household activities. There is lesser participation of women in higher education, decision-making roles, and leadership roles. This gender disparity is a hindrance in the growth rate of a country. When women participate in the workforce increases the economic growth rate of the country increases. Gender equality increases the overall wellbeing of the nation along with economic prosperity.</p><p></p><p>For overall wellbeing and growth of a nation, scoring high on gender equality is the most crucial aspect. Countries with less disparity in gender equality have progressed a lot. The government of India has also started taking steps to ensure gender equality. Several laws and policies are prepared to encourage girls. “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana” (Save girl, and make girls educated) campaign is created to spread awareness of the importance of girl child.

                        <p>Gender equality is not just the concern of half of the world’s population; it is a human right, a concern for us all, because no society can develop – economically, politically, or socially – when half of its population is marginalized. We must leave no one behind.</p><p></p><p>This is a year of global action. Governments will adopt a new set of Sustainable Development Goals, work together to draft a meaningful climate agreement, and craft a framework to provide the financial resources needed to deliver on a global sustainable development agenda. Those participating would be wise to remember that inclusive sustainable development can be realized only when all human rights – including gender equality – are protected, respected, and fulfilled.</p><br />

Not only does nursing offer a vast array of job opportunities and a decent salary, but it also gives you the ability to make a difference in someone’s life. The education required to become a licensed practical nurse is not as tedious as some other jobs, but becoming a nurse is more than just going to college and taking your boards. The daily routines of licensed practical nurses cover a lot of bases, but usually remain pretty similar across the boards no matter where you work. The job outlook of licensed practical nurses in the future is promising, and I believe a career in nursing in my future is also very promising.</p><br />

They are also used as visual aids in glasses to correct defects of vision such as myopia and hypermetropia.</p><p>A lens is a transmissive optical device which focuses or disperses a light beam by means of refraction. A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or molded to a desired shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.</p><p></p><p>hope this is the answer you expect</p><p></p><p>#KEEPONLEARNING</p><br />

                        As much as I would love for gender equality to become an accomplishment soon, I genuinely question that it will entirely come to a possibility. Although numerous of nations claim that they are not gender one-sided, many people still consider themselves as more superior than the opposite gender. Throughout most of Earth’s entire life time, women are most likely to become inferior to their male opponents. This sort of separation is exceptionally dangerous and can prompt troublesome ways of life, such as difficult lifestyles and one gender being submissive to another.The degrees and reasons for the amount of inequality differ from all across the world.<br /><br />

                        <br />“The world is flat” so there are many reasons for people to consider that the world is more and more exciting, comfortable, interesting in the future. But in my own opinion, the future will be more firghtening than it is exciting. Because of the following reasons.<br />Firstly, because of developing of technology, economics, the increasing of population therefore humanrace will need more the natural resource and certainly, we have to speed up the exploitative actions. As a result, that resource will come into exhaution because everything has its limit and in the future, I think the next generation will be harder to live and exist. Besides the above consequence, the effect of the uncontrolled exploitation is being the reason of the Act of God as flood, mudslide, floodside etc., which causes many disasters for the living of people allover the world. For example, the uncontrolled exploitation to the watershed in the North-West areas of Vietnam has caused many the floodslide, mudslide and many people killed by this disasters.<br />Secondly, the development of economics as well as the industrialization, mordenizations in the developing countries will more and more form many the urban zone, new cities, manufactures, industrial zones. Besides the consequence of improving the living standard for many people, they will also lead the world to the hardship such as house-glass effect, environmental pollution, water pollution, the global warming etc,. Especially, these phenomenons are impacting on the world gradually and we can not feel or see it overnight so it seems to be the world have not had the specific solutions to solve them absolutely so far. Obviously, the above “heritages” that we leave over, are too heavy for our next generation in the future to face.<br />Thirdly, the conflict of the civilization has become seriously, especially the conflict between the Western and the Islam. The terroris attacks which the extreme Islam forces make on the tourism island Bali in Indonesia, the Trade World Center in New York America, for example, were the typical evidences for this conflict. This not only will divide the world into the opposite systems but also will cause the un-stable life for people in the countries.<br />May be I am a nostalgic person, so it sounds I love the World in the past than the World in the future. In my eyes, the future is more frightenning than it is exciting. Everytime I come back my homeland and stretch my vision out on the fields and landscape, just only dream arising in my mind: The world, please do not change.<br />

Every individual of the society yearns for equal status, opportunity, and rights. However, it is a general observation that there exists lots of discrimination between humans. Discrimination exists because of cultural differences, geographical differences, and gender. Inequality based on gender is a concern that is prevalent in the entire world.  Even in the 21st century, across globe men and women do not enjoy equal privileges. Gender equality means providing equal opportunities to both men and women in political, economic, education and health aspects.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What do you think about gender equality?</p><p>We will probably never see a culture in which sexism is completely eradicated, and where there is no inequality whatsoever. However we do have it within our power to reduce much of the suffering caused by sexism and inequality. Whether or not we will ever exercise that power remains to be seen.</p><p></p><p>I think it’s easy to lose perspective when it comes to this issue. We see it from both sides. Some stubbornly asserting that we already have equality of opportunity in defiance of an abundance of data to the contrary while others are worried about absurdities like manspreading, and think that asking a woman the time is a form of street harassment. Exposure to this dichotomy is enough to make anyone want to throw up their hands and walk away.</p><p></p><p>If you want to get a fresh understanding for the importance of gender issues I encourage you to make friends with people in developing countries, and remember that they represent the majority. So much can be done to improve equality in global terms, and the rewards will be considerable.</p><p></p><p>Even so I frequently feel gender equality is a lost cause because the public image of feminism is in absolute tatters, and the movement is so indelibly tied to the social left, and particularly the extreme left, that they must rise or fall together. This negative perception is vastly more intense in the developing world where change is most needed. In fact women I’ve spoken to in places like Indonesia and India admit that to question traditional gender-norms is to become a social pariah. Feminism is not seen as something empowering or useful. Many will hear the word feminazi before they will ever hear the word feminist. I contend that if feminism were as cogent and benevolent as its proponents claim this could not merely be explained as backlash.</p><p></p><p>Even in the west we see this adversity to feminism with polls showing most people supporting equality, but only a minority believing feminism is a good thing. This is the public perception, and it needs to be tackled somehow if we’re going to move forward, but from what I can see feminists are in a critical state of denial about this, having intellectually stultified themselves with the circular reasoning of backlash to explain away all forms of criticism. As things stand they push the dictionary definition of feminism as the socially accepted one even as they discredit the dictionary definitions of sexism and racism, while employing an endless string of No True Scotsman fallacies, and an array of Motte and Bailey fallacies to deflect criticism rather than actually reflecting on why their movement is getting such an ugly reputation. Meanwhile the change they claim to be fighting for just isn’t happening.</p><p></p><p>I wish I knew what to do, but the more I see the way these big social movements operate the more disillusioned I get.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Don't worry this is safe from Qoura </p><br />
