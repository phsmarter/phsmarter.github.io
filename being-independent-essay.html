Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

When you contrast them, you look for things that are different. Some pieces of writing both compare and contrast to things in the same paragraph or essay. Writers use transitional words to suggest whether something is being compared or contrasted. Think about two buildings that you are familiar with. They can be two different homes, two different schools, or any combination of buildings. Write a 4-paragraph composition in your answer sheet which compares and contrasts both two buildings.​</a>

                                            Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. The windmill scene, in which Don Quixote mistakes the technology that grinds the grain produced in the semi-arid Manchegan landscape for giants, became immediately iconic. The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. 
THE writer presented what point of view?
The correct answer is: First person

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. The windmill scene, in which Don Quixote mistakes the technology that grinds the grain produced in the semi-arid Manchegan landscape for giants, became immediately iconic. The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote. 
What type of description is used in the paragraph?

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. 
THE writer presented what point of view?
The correct answer is: First person

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day.

Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />

                            17. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.
