                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1) Playing online games instead of doing academic activities can have detrimental consequences for a student's academic performance. This can result in poor grades, incomplete assignments, and missed deadlines, as well as negatively impacting time management and self-discipline skills. If the behavior persists, the student may face consequences such as academic probation, suspension, or expulsion from school. Therefore, it is crucial for students to prioritize their academic responsibilities and develop good time management habits to achieve academic success.</p><p></p><p>2) An employee neglecting their duties in the company can result in delayed projects, missed deadlines, decreased productivity, and a lack of communication and coordination among team members. They may also face disciplinary actions and damage their reputation and future career prospects. To avoid these consequences, employees must understand the significance of their duties and responsibilities and strive to fulfill them to the best of their abilities, contributing to the success of the company and ensuring their own professional growth and development.</p><p></p><p>3) A group of students picking up trash in front of the school every morning is a positive action that can have a significant impact on the school and its surroundings. By taking the initiative to clean up the area, the students are setting an example of good citizenship and community responsibility. Their efforts can help to keep the environment clean and safe for everyone and may also encourage others to do the same. Moreover, this act of service can foster a sense of teamwork and unity among the students, as they work together towards a common goal. Overall, picking up trash every morning can contribute to a cleaner and more pleasant environment, while also instilling important values in the students.</p><p></p><p>4) Taking illegal drugs can have severe consequences for an individual's health, relationships, and overall well-being. The use of drugs can lead to addiction, which can negatively impact the individual's physical and mental health, impair their judgment, and cause financial and legal problems. Illegal drug use can also damage relationships with family, friends, and colleagues and can lead to a lack of trust and support from loved ones. Furthermore, drug use can result in long-term negative effects, including memory loss, chronic health issues, and even death from overdose. It is crucial for individuals to understand the risks and consequences of taking illegal drugs and to seek help if they are struggling with addiction.</p><p></p><p>5) The action of a motorcycle driver wearing a helmet and protective gear has several positive consequences. Firstly, wearing a helmet can prevent head injuries and even save the rider's life in the event of an accident. Protective gear can also reduce the severity of injuries and minimize the risk of skin abrasions and broken bones. Additionally, wearing protective gear can make the rider more visible to other drivers and reduce the likelihood of accidents. By prioritizing safety, the motorcycle driver is also complying with the law and avoiding penalties for not wearing a helmet or protective gear. Overall, the consequences of wearing a helmet and protective gear while riding a motorcycle are positive and can lead to a safer and more enjoyable riding experience.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I had the opportunity to visit a small village in India a few years ago. I had never been to such a place before and was excited to experience a different culture and way of life. </p><p></p><p>When I arrived, I noticed a few differences right away. The people were dressed differently, spoke different languages, and had different customs than what I was used to. I could tell that the way they lived was very different from what I was used to. </p><p></p><p>At first, I was a bit overwhelmed by all the differences. I wasn't sure how to act or what to do. I decided to take a deep breath and try to be open-minded. I made a conscious effort to observe the people and their customs and to be respectful of their culture and beliefs.</p><p></p><p>I began to engage in conversations with the locals and ask questions about their way of life. I was surprised to learn about their customs and beliefs. I was also amazed by the hospitality of the people. They welcomed me with open arms and made me feel like I was part of the family. </p><p></p><p>I learned a lot from this experience and it changed the way I look at things. I learned that even though we are different, we can still find common ground and respect each other. I also learned to be more open-minded and accepting of different cultures and ways of life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>message me if gusto nyo Po sumali sa gc namin  </p><br />

                            30. Activity 2. REFLECTION • Think of an experience where you had observed differences, changes or identifying qualities from another society or a group of people you have encountered before. Narrate this experience and explain the ways how you handled it. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>One cultural difference that is often observed is the way people from different cultures express emotions. In some cultures, it is common to be very expressive and loud when expressing emotions, while in others, people tend to be more reserved and express emotions in a more subtle way.</p><p></p><p>One experience that comes to mind is when I was observing a conversation between a person from a very expressive culture and a person from a more reserved culture. The person from the expressive culture was very passionate and animated, using a lot of hand gestures and speaking loudly, while the person from the reserved culture was more subdued and spoke softly, without much physical expression.</p><p></p><p>At first, it seemed like the two were not communicating well and that the person from the reserved culture was not interested in the conversation. However, as I observed more closely, I realized that the person from the reserved culture was actually listening very carefully and responding thoughtfully, even if their expression and tone were not as enthusiastic as the person from the expressive culture.</p><p></p><p>To handle this situation, it's important to recognize that different cultures have different ways of expressing emotions and that these differences do not necessarily indicate disinterest or lack of engagement. Instead, it's important to be patient, respectful, and open-minded when interacting with people from different cultures and to try to understand their perspective and communication style. By doing so, we can build stronger relationships and learn from each other's differences.</p><p></p><p></p><p>pa Brainliest Ty </p><br />
