An operational definition refers to a specific definition of a concept in a research study. 18. Technical definition is used by the researcher to measure the identified variables. 19. Operational definition aims to give meaning to the concept of a particular key term used by the researcher to establish the nature of that term in the study. 20. Giving technical and operational definition in research enables us to have a common understanding of key term used in research.​</p>

STATEMENTS 1. Definition of Terms section is written in the first chapter of a research or X paper. 2. Definition of terms is an essential section of research since it ensures a common understanding of key concepts and terminologies that is shared between the writer and the readers. 3. Review of Related Literature consists of keywords that were operationally defined to promote understanding of the terms used in the research paper. 4. Defining key terms will help clarify the purpose and direction of the study being conducted. 5. Definition of Terms section uses operational definition. 6. Common words should not be defined in the Definition of Terms section, only jargon and technical terms. 7. Conceptual Definition is based on a dictionary, encyclopedia, or any trusted sources of the meaning of words. 8. Operational Definition is based on the specific use or context of a keyword in a research study. 9.
