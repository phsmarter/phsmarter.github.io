                                              John Masefield’s poem "Sea Fever" is about a narrator who loves the sea. Think of some activity in your life that you love to do. It can be a hobby, or a sport, or anything, just as long as it’s something you love.  Write a journal entry of about 150 words in which you reflect on why you love it. You might ask yourself: How does it make you feel when you’re doing it? Why is it important to you?   </a>

Beltran, SVDOnce there lived a poor mother and her son. When he grew up, the son fell in love with a woman whowas not serious with him. He told her he would do anything she asked if only she would marry him. Shetold him: “I will marry you only if you cut out your mother’s heart and bring it to me, only in this way canyou prove your love.” In the dark of the night, he went into the mother’s room, took from his belt a knifefrom his mother’s kitchen, and plunged it into her breast. He cut out her heart and ran with blood stainedhands towards the home of his loved one. As he ran with the heart of his mother in his hands, hestumbled and fell. His mother’s heart said to him. “Be careful my son, you might hurt yourself”​</a>

                                            Money indeed is not always the basis or source of happiness. While it is true that you can buy anything with money which makes you happy, still that happiness seems and sounds shallow. True happiness lies first on being at peace with yourself, learning to accept all the things you are capable or incapable of doing. Second, avoid comparing yourself with others. For the moment you do compare, you will just end up unhappy. Next, learn also to accept your weaknesses and do something to turn these weaknesses into strengths. Afterwards, you will come to discover your limitless abilities as you are also able to make threats as an opportunity for you to succeed. Finally, contentment creeps in the moment you realize and accept that salt and sugar are two entirely different entities. The ant takes only the sugar, not the salt. And so, you do, accept and love who you really are, and you will live happily and contentedly. 1. What do you think are the underlined words? How do they function in the given paragraph?​</a>

                                            What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</a>

He told her he would do anything she asked if only she would marry him. Shetold him: “I will marry you only if you cut out your mother’s heart and bring it to me, only in this way canyou prove your love.” In the dark of the night, he went into the mother’s room, took from his belt a knifefrom his mother’s kitchen, and plunged it into her breast. He cut out her heart and ran with blood stainedhands towards the home of his loved one. As he ran with the heart of his mother in his hands, hestumbled and fell.

                            10. Money indeed is not always the basis or source of happiness. While it is true that you can buy anything with money which makes you happy, still that happiness seems and sounds shallow. True happiness lies first on being at peace with yourself, learning to accept all the things you are capable or incapable of doing. Second, avoid comparing yourself with others. For the moment you do compare, you will just end up unhappy. Next, learn also to accept your weaknesses and do something to turn these weaknesses into strengths. Afterwards, you will come to discover your limitless abilities as you are also able to make threats as an opportunity for you to succeed. Finally, contentment creeps in the moment you realize and accept that salt and sugar are two entirely different entities. The ant takes only the sugar, not the salt. And so, you do, accept and love who you really are, and you will live happily and contentedly. 1. What do you think are the underlined words? How do they function in the given paragraph?​</h2><br />

                            20. What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</h2><br />

It can grow even on a rooftop or by the side of a small stream. Let it just grow. Don’t call it anything; don’t try to freeze it; don’t try to limit it – it will be dead. If you try to capture a flower, what happens to that flower? If you try to capture a butterfly, what happens to that butterfly? It’s gone, it’s dead. All you will be left with is a skeleton. Do you want to live with a skeleton? Then why do you want to capture love? Why can’t you just love and let it be? Don’t raise expectations, let it flow.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The message of the poem is that work hard and dont let go of your goal.
