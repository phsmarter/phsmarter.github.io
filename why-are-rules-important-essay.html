Minors should obey the specific rule for it is implemented for their own safety, the government's actions will always think for the benifits of the people living in the community. A rule will always be a rule and it is a must to follow it, whether you like it or not it'll always be a rule. Rules are made for peace so if you want to live in a peaceful world, you must follow the implemented rule.

*Write an essay about a safety rule that you think is important but people often ignore because it seems like following it will ruin their fun
*Convince your readers why they should obey this safety rule≤≠≤</h2><br />
                        One of the safety rules in the community that citizens always ignore is the traffic lights rule. Most of the people don't heed the traffic lights signal because of lots of reasons, they maybe in a hurry or no officers' are watching so no one's gonna get caught or simply because it's more fun to cross the street seemingly chasing the cars. Chasing those vehicles provides thrill and excitement for those who are adventurous people and always, this practice leads them to trouble and even worst unfortunate events such as fatal accidents. People should stop risking something precious especially their lives for fleeting pleasure such as excitement or thrill because our life is worth more than that. We should know where to find pleasure and how to find it in the safest way possible and surely it's not found in chasing cars in the busy streets of the metropolis. <br />
