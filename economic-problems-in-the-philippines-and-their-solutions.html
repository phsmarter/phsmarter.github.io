Out of 105 million people living in the Philippines, nearly seven million rely on unsafe and unsustainable water sources and 24 million lack access to improved sanitation. Despite its growing economy, the Philippines faces significant challenges in terms of water and sanitation access. The growing number of people especially in cities has made it difficult to provide new residents with adequate water and sanitation services. This is just one sad truth of the existence of scarcity in our country. With this realization, why do you think is economics deeply rooted in the concept of scarcity? In your own simple way, how can you help solve the problem of scarcity?​</a>

                        ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF THE PHILIPPINES<p>The <strong>economic problem</strong> of the Philippines is still high unemployment  and the concentration of wealth in a small number of wealthy families. Unemployment is still remained high because  of rapid population growth and increased labor force participation. Poverty  is one of the <strong>economic problem</strong> that can be an immediate or circuitous supporter of joblessness. Families under this class can't send their kids to class, and request that they add to the family by entering the work market early. Critics say that gathered abundance in the possession of a couple of rich Filipinos keeps most of the populace from partaking in fast financial development. Since the rich own an incredible part of the nation's territory, farmland is costly.</p><p></p><p>what is economic problem? : brainly.ph/question/629042</p><p></p><p>#LetsStudy</p><br />

Out of 105 million people living in the Philippines, nearly seven million rely on unsafe and unsustainable water sources and 24 million lack access to improved sanitation. Despite its growing economy, the Philippines faces significant challenges in terms of water and sanitation access. The growing number of people especially in cities has made it difficult to provide new residents with adequate water and sanitation services.
