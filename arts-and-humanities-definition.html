                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Culture and the arts
</p><p>Apollo Belvedere in a Landscape by Charles Meynier
</p><p>
</p><p>The word culture is derived from the Latin root cultura or cultus meaning to "inhabit, cultivate, or honour". In general, culture refers to human activity; different definitions of culture reflect different theories for understanding, or criteria for valuing human activity. Present day anthropologists use the term to refer to the universal human capacity to classify experiences and to encode and communicate them symbolically. They regard this capacity as a defining feature of the genus Homo. Since culture is learned, people living in different places have different cultures. There can be different cultures in different countries, and there can also be shared cultures among continents.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
