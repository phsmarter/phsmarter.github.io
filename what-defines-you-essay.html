                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Globalization is the word used to describe the growing interdependence of the world’s economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information. Countries have built economic partnerships to facilitate these movements over many centuries. This guide uses the term more narrowly to refer to international trade and some of the investment flows among advanced economies, mostly focusing on the United States. The wide-ranging effects of globalization are complex and politically charged. As with major technological advances, globalization benefits society as a whole, while harming certain groups. Understanding the relative costs and benefits can pave the way for alleviating problems while sustaining the wider payoffs.Globalization decrease the cost of manufacturing. This means that companies can offer goods at a lower price to consumers. Ang Average cost ng mga goods ay isang mahalagang aspeto na nag-aambag sa pagtaas sa pamantayan ng pamumuhay. Ang mga consumers ay mayroon ding access sa mas malawak na iba't ibang mga goods. Social and economic factors, such as income, education, employment, community safety, and social supports can significally affect how well and how long we live. These factors affect our ability to make healthy choices, afford medical care and housing, and manage stress and more. Economist generally agree that economic development and growth are influenced by four factors: human resources, physical capital, natural capital, natural resources and technology. Highly developed na bansa na naka focus sa mga lugar na ito. Ang mga hindi gaanong maunlad na countries, even those with high amounts ofnatural resources, will lag behind when they fail to promote research in technology at improve nila ang skills at education ng mga kanilang manggagawa dahil ang mga skills at education at training ng mga labor force ay may direct effect on the growth of an economy. A skilled, well trained workforce ay more productive at magpoproduce ng high-quality output that adds efficiency to an economy. Shortage ng skilled labor ay pwede pababain ang economic growth ng isang bansa at under-utilized, illiterate and unskilled workforce will become a drag on an economy and may possibly lead to higher unemploymen</p><br />
