You are to investigate someone who uses trigonometry in their professional lives. You
will be responsible for submitting a report.
The report should describe what the profession is all about. Let us know what they do
and what type of education is needed to enter that profession. The report should also include a
description of how trigonometry is used by the professional in their work. What type of
problems do they need trigonometry for? Include one example of a problem that could be solved
using trigonometry from the field of work you are researching. A list of resources that you used
must be included. These may be articles, books, websites, magazines, etc...
Your report will be evaluated using the following rubric.</h2><br />
                        <p>IDEA ONLY:</p><p></p>Trigonometry spreads its applications into various fields such as architects, surveyors, astronauts, physicists, engineers and even crime scene investigators.<p></p>Trigonometry, the branch of mathematics that describes the relationship between the angles and lengths of triangles, helped early explorers plot the stars and navigate the seas. <p></p>Much of architecture and engineering relies on triangular supports. When an engineer determines the length of cables, the height of support towers, and the angle between the two when gauging weight loads and bridge strength, trigonometry helps him to calculate the correct angles. It also allows builders to correctly lay out a curved wall, figure the proper slope of a roof or the correct height and rise of a stairway. <p></p><p></p>You can also use trigonometry at home to determine the height of a tree on your property without the need to climb dozens of feet in the air, or find the square footage of a curved piece of land.<p></p>Trigonometry plays a major role in musical theory and production. Sound waves travel in a repeating wave pattern, which can be represented graphically by sine and cosine functions. A single note can be modeled on a sine curve, and a chord can be modeled with multiple sine curves used in conjunction with one another. A graphical representation of music allows computers to create and understand sounds.<p></p><p>RELEVANCE:</p><p></p>TRIGONOMETRY IS A REALLY GREAT HELP TO PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS;<p></p><p><strong>Architects</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Engineers</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Music</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Theory</strong><strong>/</strong><strong>Production</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Electrical</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Engineers</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Manufacturing</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Industries</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>athematicians, </strong><strong>D</strong><strong>ata </strong><strong>Sp</strong><strong>ecialists, </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>oggers, </strong><strong>St</strong><strong>atisticians, </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>ctuaries</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>D</strong><strong>rafters, </strong><strong>Ch</strong><strong>emists, </strong><strong>E</strong><strong>conomists, </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>hysicists, </strong><strong>R</strong><strong>egistered nurses, </strong><strong>B</strong><strong>uilding </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>nspectors, </strong><strong>B</strong><strong>oilermakers, </strong><strong>M</strong><strong>achinists and </strong><strong>Mi</strong><strong>llwrights.</strong></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning </p><br />
