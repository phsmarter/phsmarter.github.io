                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many things have changed as a result of COVID-19. Normally I would be at school on the weekdays expanding my mind, but with everything happening with COVID-19 my school and many others have been shut down for the remainder of the year. Instead of being in a classroom and learning, we are sent packets and given work online. You’re probably thinking "well at least you still get to learn,” and that may be true but not everyone has the resources to learn, or maybe we learn better in a classroom setting. School being closed is just one way COVID-19 has caused a lot of damage.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mathematics is a school subject that people have mixed feeling about. Many of my personal friends complain about math and express their dislike and hatred towards the subject. I, on the other hand, seem to enjoy math most of the time. Although I sometimes feel angry when I continue to get a certain problem incorrect, I always put my best effort into finding my mistake and fixing it. I have had some amazing math teachers, but I’ve also had some very bad ones. I think that my teacher has a huge effect upon how well I will learn that subject, which can be considered good or bad. I have always realized that math is a very important topic, so I have consistently worked very hard to learn it.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My journey as a junior high school student has been a time of growth, learning, and discovery. During these years, I have had the opportunity to explore new subjects, meet new people, and develop new skills that will serve me well throughout my life.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant changes I experienced during my junior high school years was the shift from a more general education to a more specialized curriculum. As I moved from grade school to junior high school, I had the opportunity to study subjects in greater depth, such as science, math, and English. This allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of these subjects and prepare for the more advanced coursework that awaits me in high school and beyond.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of my junior high school journey has been the opportunity to make new friends and expand my social circle. As I entered a new school with new classmates, I had the chance to meet people from different backgrounds and with different interests. This allowed me to broaden my perspective, learn from others, and develop important social skills that will serve me well throughout my life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, my journey as a junior high school student has been characterized by a commitment to personal growth and development. I have learned the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance in achieving my goals, whether that be acing a test or mastering a new skill. I have also learned the value of seeking help when needed, whether that be from teachers, mentors, or peers, and the importance of taking care of my physical and mental health.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my journey as a junior high school student has been a time of growth, learning, and development. I am grateful for the experiences and opportunities that have come my way during these years and look forward to continuing my journey as I move on to high school and beyond</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There has never been a time when art critics held more power than during the second half of the twentieth century. Following the Second World War, with the relocation of the world’s artistic epicenter from Paris to New York, a different kind of war was waged in the pages of magazines across the country. As part of the larger “culture wars” of the mid-century, art critics began to take on greater influence than they’d ever held before. For a time, two critics in particular—who began as friends, and remained in the same social circles for much of their lives—set the stakes of the debates surrounding the maturation of American art that would continue for decades. The ideas about art outlined by Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg are still debated today, and the extent to which they were debated in the past has shaped entire movements of the arts. Below are ten works of criticism through which one can trace the mainstreaming of Clement Greenberg’s formalist theory, and how its dismantling led us into institutional critique and conceptual art today.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest mwaa</p><br />

                            19. journey in life essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each person’s life is a journey on a contorted road dotted with bumps and craters. At certain points, the bumps could seem as high as mountains and the pits as deep as lots, making this journey called life appear quite despondent. Although occasionally, your predicaments are entirely fate’s blunders, but perchance, they are your own. Your personal characteristics roughly resemble a steering wheel for your journey. They could be positive traits, which could steer you on a more decent path; or negative traits, which could steer you to a path that’s, well… not so decent. Although you have no control over fate, you have power over your own “driving skills”, and could thus widen or narrow your chance for a smooth, prosperous journey. Also, it is beneficial to remember that you are not alone, for there are many other roads that coincide with yours, where others are conducting through their own journeys and floundering through their own bumps and craters as well. Drive together, and you could purvey support and encouragement for one another, and thus institute milder paths for all of you. Most prominently, no matter how harsh the terrain of your road becomes, just remember that you will pull through and be transformed for the better because of it.</p><p></p><p>This optimistic philosophy that I’ve adopted had been much solace to me in my own journey in becoming a successful high school student. It was not at all easy. Although fate has been overall lenient to me, it was my “driving skills” that tended to direct my course towards huge bumps. Despite my awareness of my own flaws and omissions, I still compulsorily reproached others and sought ways to exonerate myself. This was one of the worst traits I retain. It precluded me from obtaining responsibility for my choices and learning from past oversights, thus impeded my maturing process. For example, my projects were oftentimes undone till the last minute (including this one). I would think to myself, “I don’t feel like doing it today, so I’ll work on it tomorrow”. Thus the project was delayed further and further until there was no “tomorrow” for it anymore, and then I would end up working well over midnight while secretly scowling at the teacher for giving out such a tedious and inane assignment. Immaturity and refusal to admit my errors caused me to plunge into countless pits in my journey. The one positive trait that had proved to be highly efficient in boosting me out of these pits is ambition. I know that too much of it could corrupt a person, but so far it had only empowered my spirit with much-needed optimism. My greatest ambition is to become a renowned novelist; therefore every hardship and pain to me befits an inspiration for a potential novel. It is a most optimistic perception of things, and it had succoured me through many phases of emotional turmoil.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In my journey through the Alternative Learning System (ALS), I have gained valuable learnings that have shaped my perspective and enriched my life. Here are some of the key learnings I have acquired:</p><p></p><p>1. Self-Determination: ALS has taught me the importance of taking charge of my own education and personal growth. I have learned that learning is a lifelong process, and it is up to me to pursue knowledge and skills that will help me achieve my goals.</p><p></p><p>2. Resilience: The ALS journey is not always easy. It requires determination and resilience to overcome challenges and setbacks. I have learned to persevere and stay motivated, even when faced with difficulties. This resilience has not only helped me in my educational pursuits but also in other areas of my life.</p><p></p><p>3. Adaptability: ALS has provided me with a flexible learning environment, where I can tailor my studies to fit my individual needs and circumstances. This has taught me the importance of being adaptable and open to new approaches to learning. I have learned to embrace change and adjust my strategies when necessary.</p><p></p><p>4. Collaboration: ALS has provided opportunities for collaboration and peer learning. I have learned the value of working together with my fellow learners, sharing ideas, and supporting each other in our educational journey. Collaboration has not only enhanced my learning but also fostered a sense of community and camaraderie.</p><p></p><p>5. Empowerment: ALS has empowered me to take control of my own education and future. I have learned that education is a powerful tool that can transform lives and create opportunities. Through ALS, I have gained the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue my dreams and make a positive impact in my community.</p><p></p><p>6. Inclusivity: ALS embraces diversity and inclusivity, providing educational opportunities to individuals who may have faced barriers to traditional schooling. I have learned the importance of inclusivity and respecting the unique backgrounds and experiences of my fellow learners. ALS has shown me that everyone has the potential to learn and succeed, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my ALS journey has been a transformative experience. It has taught me important life lessons and equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to pursue my dreams. I am grateful for the opportunities ALS has provided me and the invaluable learnings that will continue to guide me throughout my life.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Learning Journey in ALS</p><p></p><p>Alternative Learning System (ALS) is an educational program that provides opportunities for Filipinos who have not completed their basic education to obtain a secondary school diploma. As a student of ALS, my journey has been challenging but fulfilling. It has taught me valuable lessons that have helped me grow as a person and as a learner.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant lessons I have learned in ALS is the importance of perseverance. The program requires dedication, hard work, and discipline. There were times when I felt discouraged and overwhelmed by the amount of work that needed to be done, but I learned to push through and keep going. I realized that with determination and persistence, I could overcome any obstacle.</p><p></p><p>Another lesson I have learned in ALS is the value of time management. The program has a self-directed learning approach, which means that students are responsible for managing their own time and completing the modules on their own. I learned to prioritize my tasks, set deadlines, and avoid procrastination. I also realized that time is a precious commodity and that I should use it wisely to achieve my goals.</p><p></p><p>ALS has also taught me the importance of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The program emphasizes independent learning and encourages students to think critically, analyze information, and come up with solutions to problems. I learned to question assumptions, evaluate evidence, and make informed decisions. These skills have not only helped me in my studies but also in my personal and professional life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, ALS has taught me the value of education. It has given me a second chance to pursue my dreams and improve my life. It has also made me realize that education is a lifelong journey, and there is always room for growth and improvement. I learned to appreciate the power of knowledge and how it can transform lives.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, my learning journey in ALS has been a transformative experience. It has taught me valuable lessons that have helped me grow as a person and as a learner. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this program and for the support and guidance of my teachers and fellow students. I look forward to continuing my education and making a positive impact in my community.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope it helps po! please rate me a 5 stars, thank u!</p><br />

Burnout; Nervous Breakdown; Major Depressive Episode. The health professionals all had different labels. The truth was, I was broken. Pride comes before the fall. Here was the inevitable fall. In the matter of a single moment sitting in front of my computer screen, my entire life changed course. Nothing would ever be the same again. I did not realize it at the time and thought that a day off was all that was required. It was not to be. The psychologist had a serious talk to me and I realized the seriousness of the situation I found myself in. I kept wondering how I had missed all the signs? It was plain to see, constant high blood pressure, inability to sleep, growing anxiety, lack of boundaries, stress, the list was almost endless.</p><p></p><p>My journey had begun.</p><p></p><p>For the first time that I can recall I had no destination in mind. I was broken. I did not want to be anywhere or do anything. I had lost the will to live and I didn’t care. Looking back at that time I don’t even recall having thoughts. I either lay in bed or sat on a chair under a blanket. I simply existed, as if in some strange comatose state, whether this was brought on by the breakdown or the handful of tablets that I was required to take every day I am not sure. None the less I was little more than an inanimate object. My fiancé took great care of me, prepared meals, handled whatever business fallouts were taking place, encouraging me to rest and give it time, inviting me to try to make tiny steps towards recovery.</p><p></p><p>This was not how I imagined the journey would be. After all, when they say that it is about the journey, not the destination, one would think that the journey should at least be enjoyable. I could find absolutely no joy in anything.</p><p></p><p>There is also a saying that: “every cloud has a silver lining.” Fortunately, that has also proven to be true for me. My brother in law bought me a return ticket to go visit them in India, and I accepted the gift as I needed to just get away from the world. In March this year, I nervously embarked on a journey to go spend some time with them in India. I did not have any plans to do anything in India, and the main reason for me going was just to get away from everything for a while. Even if the only thing I did whilst I was in India was stay in their house for 6 weeks that would have worked for me.</p><p></p><p>Something inside me shifted though. The moment I said goodbye to my fiancé and stepdaughter and walked through to departures I knew that I was on my own from here. I knew that it was now up to me to create the context for how this journey would unfold.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong># Carry On learning</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. As the disease progresses, people with ALS may experience a range of physical and cognitive changes that can impact their ability to learn and retain new information. Despite these challenges, learning can still be an important part of a person's journey with ALS.</p><p></p><p>One of the key ways that learning can be integrated into the ALS journey is by keeping the mind active. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities such as reading, writing, puzzles, and games can help keep the mind sharp and improve cognitive function. This is particularly important as ALS can cause cognitive changes such as difficulty with language, memory, and problem-solving.</p><p></p><p>Another way that learning can be incorporated into the ALS journey is by attending support groups. Joining a support group for people with ALS can provide opportunities to learn from others who are going through similar experiences, share knowledge and insights, and receive emotional support. Support groups can also provide a sense of community and belonging, which can be particularly valuable for people with ALS who may feel isolated or disconnected from others.</p><p></p><p>Attending regular medical appointments is also an important part of the ALS journey, as it provides an opportunity to learn about the progression of the disease and new treatments and therapies that may help manage symptoms. Participating in research studies can also provide access to new treatments and therapies that may improve quality of life and slow the progression of the disease.</p><p></p><p>Assistive technology devices can also play a key role in enabling people with ALS to continue learning and engaging with the world around them. Speech-generating devices, eye-tracking systems, and mobility aids are just a few examples of the many assistive technology devices that can help people with ALS continue to communicate, learn, and participate in daily activities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, learning can be an important part of a person's journey with ALS. Despite the challenges that come with this disease, there are many ways to continue learning and growing, from keeping the mind active to participating in research studies and using assistive technology devices. By staying engaged in learning and seeking out resources and support, people with ALS can continue to thrive and live a fulfilling life.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>diko alam kung ilang words kailangan mo pero 2000 words yan.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>My </strong><strong>direction</strong></p><p>(Own Experience)</p><p></p><p></p><p> I had only had a couple of friends and never really ventured out to make new friends. So, for the majority of that summer I kept to myself, and read the Twilight Saga. During my readings of the Twilight Saga, I became a major fan of the series. This was my very first ‘fandom’, of a long line that will soon come in the upcoming years. I was introduced to Tumblr, where all fan geeks like me gathered to share our feelings on books, music, and art that we liked. Through Tumblr, I was introduced fanfiction and fanart. This was how I got into drawing.</p><p></p><p>I still had no self esteem as an artist. When my mom would call me the little artist, I shrugged at this idea. In my mind, being an artist means you actually have to be good at.</p><p></p><p>The first couple drawings, as you would expect, were really terrible. I thought I was never going to become a good artist, but, for some reason, I kept trying. I needed to practice, so I looked up drawings from other people and tried to mimic. I would draw the same picture a couple times. By doing this, I was training my eyes to pick up details, without even realising at the time.</p><p></p><p>As time went on, I expanded my world by taking on more fandoms. By doing this, I expanded my fuel for more drawings. I continued to draw more often, and started to become better at it. Of course most of my drawings are fan art, but, it helped me improve my basic skills as an artist, such as detail, color, and proportion.</p><p></p><p>So we must all have perseverance. Not everything comes from luck, others come from hard work.  I am a student, striving for what I want to achieve and what can i be achieved.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><br />
