                                            Take a look at the following example of the three essays and answer the questiona that follow. Write your answers on your answer sheet. Informative Essay Wooden-hulled pump boats will always be one of Guimaras'icon - the easiest means of transportation in going to Iloilo City apart from the Roll-on- Roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels. Basically, it can accommodate 35 to 40 passengers from either Jordan or Buenavista wharves to Iloilo City and vice versa. Employees from Iloilo City working at Guimaras need not worry about getting late to school or to work since there is ease of access and availability of bancas or wooden boats, then. However, with the mass number of COVID-19 victims, and the toll getting higher still, the usual number of passengers were trimmed down into half yet, the conventional travel time of 15 to 20 minutes under falr weather conditions still stands true. Moreover, at the onset of 2021, these said motorboats are nowhere in sight since the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) did not renew their Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). This heartbreaking move left almost 400 motorboat crews unemployed - lost their main source of income, in as much as their respective families are struggling for survival even in providing for their basic needs; 91 wooden-hulled boats were phased out.

                                            Jonathan Swift was born on November 30, 1667, in Dublin, Ireland. Throughout his life, he tried to achieve political distinction in Ireland and the nearby country of England, but he was generally unsuccessful in his attempts. Swift did find success, however, in his writing. He wrote many books, essays, and pamphlets during his lifetime. Often, he used his writing to censure the individuals, society, and politics of his time.  One of Swift’s most famous literary works is the book Gulliver’s Travels, which he wrote as a travel narrative, a popular genre at the time it was published. By using the travel narrative genre, Swift was able to achieve his purposes while keeping them hidden. Why did Swift want to hide his purposes? It may be that he did not want people to know they were being educated and often mocked. If his audience had known, they may not have read his masterpiece, and Gulliver’s Travels would have been lost forever.     Based on this excerpt, what can you infer about Jonathan Swift’s life?  Swift’s birthdays were often depressing and lonely. Swift had a large family and tremendous wealth. Swift traveled widely, which is reflected in Gulliver’s Travels. Swift’s writings were connected to his desire to enter politics.</a>

Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

However, it is very untimely to replace the wooden-hulled boats with the fiber glass and steel-hulled ones. First, the pandemic is still too far from over and life is not stable as before. Many Filipinos have lost their jobs because of this; much more the crews of the 91 wooden-hulled boats that were not allowed to sail again at the onset of 2021. Their means of living simply rely at whenever these boats set sail and traverse the lloilo-Guimaras Strait; this has been their only bread and butter for decades and with this halt in its operation, it will surely post a big impact as to their daily survival even on their basic needs and worst, the education of their children. It must have been painful for both operators, crews and their respective families to lose their source of living amidst this pandemic. Second, the phasing out of the wooden-hulled units was so abrupt that it even posted another problem affecting another set of people; the commuters, small-scale business folks situated at the wharf area and the tricycle drivers. The local government has not provided emergency ambulant boats to cater the volume of passengers; mostly to work and for education, that will be affected by the sudden stoppage of operations of the wooden-hulled units. Long hours were spent in queues with only four modernized boats plying the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait given the volume of passengers coming in and going out of the province. Additionally, with this turn of events, surely, the local economy is highly affected. Small businesses are directly affected by the increase in fare rate in hauling stocks and supplies from the city going to the province as compared with the wooden-hulled transport services. Also, daily commuters earning a minimum wage spares a bigger amount for fare than before; the thirty pesos before is now fifty and when you have to travel to and fro on a daily basis, that's at least a hundred bucks difference in a week! That's something already for them. a Lastly, how sure are we that with the modernized fiberglass and steel-hulled units, there will never be a tragedy at sea? Can we really say that there will never be? Much to our desire of accommodating the modernization program of the government, we must also consider those who will be greatly affected and device win-win situations so as not to forsake other people's welfare in every plight we take.

                                            Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

. Nations around the world are battling with a major outbreak of a new deadly
virus. The coronavirus, which started in Wuhan, China on 22nd January 2020, has
already killed around 3,000 people around the world. Countries affected include
China, America, the UK, and Italy. It has also spread in many other places like
Pakistan, Japan, Korea, and Thailand. More than 90,000 people infected with the virus
are in hospitals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that this is a
global health emergency. China has been on lockdown for many weeks and people
have not been to work, school and all public transport has been suspended. In other
countries schools have been closed and people have been told not to travel.
The new coronavirus is suspected to have come from illegally traded materials in
a Wuhan market. The virus mutated and spread from an animal to a human. There
are fears it could mutate and spread further. Scientists say the virus is contagious and
can be passed from person to person through the air. Dr. Linfa Wang, a virologist at
the Duke-National University of Singapore, said the new virus is contagious is in the
same family as SARS, but it’s different from SARS. He said people needed to look for
pneumonia-like symptoms, such as fever cough, and difficulty breathing. Fu Ning, a
36-year-old woman from Beijing, said: “I feel fearful because there’s no cure for the
virus.”

                                            Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                            6. Jonathan Swift was born on November 30, 1667, in Dublin, Ireland. Throughout his life, he tried to achieve political distinction in Ireland and the nearby country of England, but he was generally unsuccessful in his attempts. Swift did find success, however, in his writing. He wrote many books, essays, and pamphlets during his lifetime. Often, he used his writing to censure the individuals, society, and politics of his time.  One of Swift’s most famous literary works is the book Gulliver’s Travels, which he wrote as a travel narrative, a popular genre at the time it was published. By using the travel narrative genre, Swift was able to achieve his purposes while keeping them hidden. Why did Swift want to hide his purposes? It may be that he did not want people to know they were being educated and often mocked. If his audience had known, they may not have read his masterpiece, and Gulliver’s Travels would have been lost forever.     Based on this excerpt, what can you infer about Jonathan Swift’s life?  Swift’s birthdays were often depressing and lonely. Swift had a large family and tremendous wealth. Swift traveled widely, which is reflected in Gulliver’s Travels. Swift’s writings were connected to his desire to enter politics.</h2><br />
                        <strong>ANSWER:  We can infer that "Swift's writings were connected to his desire to enter politics."</strong><br /><br />Clue:<br />- tried to achieve political distinction... but he was generally unsuccessful in his attempts<br />- used his writing to censure the individuals, society, and politics of his time<br />- Swift was able to achieve his purposes while keeping them hidden. <br />

                            7. 1. Read the provided essay.
2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />

Travelling has become easier and cheaper. What has changed in people's lives in terms of:
-speed, comfort, health, family relationships
-work/employment
-holiday habits
-way of life/standard of living</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Travelling has undergone a significant transformation over the past few decades. With the advent of advanced technology and globalization, it has become easier and cheaper for people to explore new destinations. This has resulted in several changes in people's lives.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, travelling has become faster and more comfortable. Modern airplanes are equipped with the latest technology and are faster than ever before. Additionally, more affordable accommodation options have made it possible for travelers to stay in comfortable lodgings without breaking the bank. These changes have made traveling more accessible to people of all income levels.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, traveling has also impacted people's health and family relationships. Many people have started to prioritize traveling as a means of relaxation and rejuvenation. They often take breaks from their hectic work schedules and embark on a trip to unwind and spend quality time with their loved ones. This has not only helped them bond with their family but also improved their mental and physical health.</p><p></p><p>In terms of work and employment, traveling has opened up several new opportunities. Many people are now working remotely and traveling while they work. This has allowed them to explore new destinations while still maintaining a steady income. Additionally, the tourism industry has created numerous job opportunities, especially in developing countries, thereby boosting the economy.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, holiday habits have changed significantly. People are no longer content with the traditional tourist hotspots and are looking for unique experiences. This has led to an increase in adventure tourism, eco-tourism, and cultural tourism. These new forms of tourism not only provide travelers with a more authentic experience but also contribute to the preservation of the local culture and environment.</p><p></p><p>Finally, traveling has also impacted people's way of life and standard of living. People are now more open-minded and tolerant towards different cultures and lifestyles. They have become more aware of global issues such as climate change, poverty, and inequality, and are making conscious efforts to support sustainable and responsible tourism.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, traveling has brought about several changes in people's lives. It has made the world more connected and accessible, provided new opportunities for work and employment, and improved people's health, family relationships, and way of life. With the continued development of technology and tourism, traveling is likely to become even more accessible and transformative in the future</p><p></p><br />

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />

Yes, the essay does inform the reader about the current situation of the wooden-hulled pump boats in Guimaras. The essay discusses how these boats are traditionally used as a means of transportation between Guimaras and Iloilo City, but due to the pandemic and the non-renewal of the Certificate of Public Convenience, the number of passengers has been reduced and almost 400 motorboat crews have lost their jobs. The essay also highlights the importance of these boats to the local community and the impact of their loss on the livelihoods of the affected families.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            12. The Presidential Decree No. 474, Executive Order No. 125, as amended, Republic Act No. 9295 and its revised/amended Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the Manila Statement on Enhancement of the Safety of Ships Carrying Passengers on Non- International Voyages through MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 2016 - 02 provides the implementing rules on the phase out of wooden hulled ships carrying passengers in domestic shipping. However, it is very untimely to replace the wooden-hulled boats with the fiber glass and steel-hulled ones. First, the pandemic is still too far from over and life is not stable as before. Many Filipinos have lost their jobs because of this; much more the crews of the 91 wooden-hulled boats that were not allowed to sail again at the onset of 2021. Their means of living simply rely at whenever these boats set sail and traverse the lloilo-Guimaras Strait; this has been their only bread and butter for decades and with this halt in its operation, it will surely post a big impact as to their daily survival even on their basic needs and worst, the education of their children. It must have been painful for both operators, crews and their respective families to lose their source of living amidst this pandemic. Second, the phasing out of the wooden-hulled units was so abrupt that it even posted another problem affecting another set of people; the commuters, small-scale business folks situated at the wharf area and the tricycle drivers. The local government has not provided emergency ambulant boats to cater the volume of passengers; mostly to work and for education, that will be affected by the sudden stoppage of operations of the wooden-hulled units. Long hours were spent in queues with only four modernized boats plying the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait given the volume of passengers coming in and going out of the province. Additionally, with this turn of events, surely, the local economy is highly affected. Small businesses are directly affected by the increase in fare rate in hauling stocks and supplies from the city going to the province as compared with the wooden-hulled transport services. Also, daily commuters earning a minimum wage spares a bigger amount for fare than before; the thirty pesos before is now fifty and when you have to travel to and fro on a daily basis, that's at least a hundred bucks difference in a week! That's something already for them. a Lastly, how sure are we that with the modernized fiberglass and steel-hulled units, there will never be a tragedy at sea? Can we really say that there will never be? Much to our desire of accommodating the modernization program of the government, we must also consider those who will be greatly affected and device win-win situations so as not to forsake other people's welfare in every plight we take.

                            13. Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />

However, with the mass number of COVID-19 victims, and the toll getting higher still, the usual number of passengers were trimmed down into half yet, the conventional travel time of 15 to 20 minutes under fair weather conditions still stands true. Moreover, at the onset of 2021, these said motorboats are nowhere in sight since the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) did not renew their Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). This heartbreaking move left almost 400 motorboat crews unemployed - lost their main source of income, in as much as their respective families are struggling for survival even in providing for their basic needs; 91 wooden-hulled boats were phased-out.

. Nations around the world are battling with a major outbreak of a new deadly
virus. The coronavirus, which started in Wuhan, China on 22nd January 2020, has
already killed around 3,000 people around the world. Countries affected include
China, America, the UK, and Italy. It has also spread in many other places like
Pakistan, Japan, Korea, and Thailand. More than 90,000 people infected with the virus
are in hospitals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that this is a
global health emergency. China has been on lockdown for many weeks and people
have not been to work, school and all public transport has been suspended. In other
countries schools have been closed and people have been told not to travel.
The new coronavirus is suspected to have come from illegally traded materials in
a Wuhan market. The virus mutated and spread from an animal to a human. There
are fears it could mutate and spread further. Scientists say the virus is contagious and
can be passed from person to person through the air. Dr. Linfa Wang, a virologist at
the Duke-National University of Singapore, said the new virus is contagious is in the
same family as SARS, but it’s different from SARS. He said people needed to look for
pneumonia-like symptoms, such as fever cough, and difficulty breathing. Fu Ning, a
36-year-old woman from Beijing, said: “I feel fearful because there’s no cure for the
virus.”

below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />
