PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</a>

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</a>

When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon-stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology-we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future."

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like a bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.” The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be PLIANT like the Bamboo.

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

Readings/Discussions Read this essay entitled Put a Little Science in Your Life (by Brian Greene) and answer the questions that follow: "When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones, iPods, personal computers and the Internet, it's easy to see how science (and the technology to which it leads) is woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon—stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology- we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future."

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</h2><br />

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</h2><br />

                            10. A. Readings/Discussions Read this essay entitled Put a Little Science in Your Life (by Brian Greene) and answer the questions that follow: "When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones, iPods, personal computers and the Internet, it's easy to see how science (and the technology to which it leads) is woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon-stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology-we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future." Questions: 1. What kind of essay is the given? 2. What argument do the two paragraphs present? 3. Does it give supporting details? Why are supporting details important? Discussion​</h2><br />

                            14. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

</p><p>
</p><p>The 7 year old me going with Dad to a swimming pool. It was just him and I that went and so we arrived and settled down. Went down with Dad into the swimming pool and he aided me in swimming. Had a good swim, really enjoyed it, went out of the pool for a break and Dad had to go do something, asking me to remain in place and not to go anywhere. I was a good boy and I obeyed his instructions. However not this time, I had the urge to go back swimming again. Without my Dad's supervision, I entered the water slowly, submerged in the water, heads up, hands stretching out to the sides of the pool for support. So I started moving my hands, one by one, by the side of the pool, forth and back several times. I did so until I was confident (for no logical reason) that I am able to swim without any support, just by randomly flapping my arms and legs I'll do fine. I pushed away from the side of the pool completely unaware of the consequences (1.5 meters deep, no life vest, absolutely inexperienced in swimming). Randomly moving my limbs, vigorously, confident that I'll be able to keep my head above the surface; I did, for a few seconds and inevitably found myself drowning. Lucky enough to take a breath without swallowing water, held my breath and submerged. The surprising thing is that I had no feelings of fear, shock or whatsoever. I felt calm, so calm that I didn't resistant fighting back to the surface. My head was up throughout the time I was sinking, sinking slowly. I can still remember how that as if it was as if I felt safe, not worried about dying, as if accepting faith. I still didn't feel that I was running out of breath throughout the time, it was a miracle that I didn't for at least half a minute. A man was passing by and from his point of view he noticed a young figure submerged under the water, aware that this kid might actually need help. Feeling pity, he reached his hand into the water and I have seen the hand reach out to me as it grabs me and pulls me out to the light. I don't remember what happened next but the man was my Dad, breaking down into tears after discovering that he rescued and saved me by chance, having no idea it was me.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the social sciences are important because they create better institutions and systems that affect people's lives every day. Thus, social sciences help people understand how to interact with the social world—how to influence policy, develop networks, increase government accountability, and promote democracy.Through the applied social sciences, people have developed ways to understand one's self and the other people around. Counselling, for example, allows us to understand ones personality including various problems and issues that may affect on individual.Social science examines the relationships between individuals and societies, as well as the development and operation of societies, rather than studying the physical world.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Title: The Importance of Following Ethics in Research</p><p></p><p>As a student, I have been taught about the importance of following ethics in research. These ethical standards are essential in ensuring that the research conducted is credible and valid. Disregarding these standards can lead to serious consequences, not just for the researcher but for society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important ethical standards in research is ensuring the safety and well-being of participants. Researchers should obtain informed consent from participants and ensure that they are aware of the risks involved in the study. Disregarding this ethical standard can result in harm to participants, both physically and mentally. For instance, in the past, researchers have conducted studies on prisoners without their consent, resulting in physical and emotional harm.</p><p></p><p>Another important ethical standard in research is ensuring the confidentiality and privacy of participants. Researchers should take steps to protect the identity of participants and ensure that their personal information is not disclosed without their consent. Disregarding this ethical standard can result in breaches of confidentiality and privacy, leading to harm to the participants and the researcher's reputation.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, researchers should ensure that their research is conducted with integrity and honesty. They should not manipulate data or misrepresent their findings. Disregarding this ethical standard can result in the spread of false information, leading to harm to society as a whole. For instance, a recent study that claimed that vaccines cause autism was found to be fraudulent, causing harm to public health and leading to a decline in vaccination rates.</p><p></p><p>In my personal life, I apply these ethical standards in my decision-making process. I ensure that my actions do not harm others, and I prioritize the well-being and safety of those around me. I also value honesty and integrity, and I always strive to be truthful in my words and actions.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, following ethics in research is crucial for ensuring that the research conducted is credible, valid, and safe for participants. Disregarding these ethical standards can result in serious consequences, both for the researcher and society as a whole. As individuals, we can apply these ethical standards in our personal lives, leading to a better and more just society.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><strong>M</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>k</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>Brainliest</strong><strong>!</strong><strong>&lt;</strong><strong>3</strong><br />

Write your answers in the space provided. PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE by I.V. Mallari There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like a bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.” The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be PLIANT like the Bamboo.

There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

                            24. A. Readings/Discussions Read this essay entitled Put a Little Science in Your Life (by Brian Greene) and answer the questions that follow: "When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones, iPods, personal computers and the Internet, it's easy to see how science (and the technology to which it leads) is woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon—stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology- we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future."
