Our family is catholic. I was born in Marawi, Lanao del Sur Province, Philippines. An area in the Philippines where the majority of the population is Muslim and is Muslim. I lived in Marawi for more than 15 years and made many friends here. Maybe this is the reason why I consider Marawi City to be my hometown, not Escalante City, which is where my parents come from.</p><p>My parents migrated to Mindanao in the early 2000s. Where there are also many immigrants from various surrounding areas. I attended a public elementary and high school in Marawi City where I interacted with the Muslim community every day. Muslims are actually not the majority ethnicity in the Philippines. But in the city of Marawi almost the entire population where the people are usually called Maranao are Muslim. But I can adapt and they also can respect each other even though my family and I have different beliefs from the majority of the population.</p><p>It's not really that difficult for me to accept and adjust the rules of society where Islamic teachings are quite upheld according to their beliefs, especially since I went to a public school and mingled with the community. Until now, I have never regretted my decision to enter a public school even though as a minority. In fact, I am grateful that I can understand how it feels to respect each other and be present in society as a minority like what my friends who are Muslim in the Philippines feel.</p><p><strong>Learn More About :</strong></p><p>What is the summary of rizal life in berlin? https://brainly.ph/question/2650270</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
