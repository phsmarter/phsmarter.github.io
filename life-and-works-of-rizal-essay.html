                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has had a profound impact on my understanding of Philippine history and my own identity as a Filipino.</p><p></p><p>Before studying Rizal, I had a limited understanding of the events that led to the Philippines becoming a colony of Spain, and the subsequent struggle for independence. Through reading Rizal's writings, such as "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo", I gained a deeper understanding of the injustices and oppression that the Filipino people faced during that time. Rizal's writings not only exposed the injustices and corruption of the Spanish colonial government, but also highlighted the resilience and determination of the Filipino people to fight for their rights.</p><p></p><p>Rizal's writings also helped me to better understand the Philippines' cultural identity. Rizal was a true patriot, and his works were infused with pride in the Philippines' unique culture and history. Through his writings, I learned about the customs, traditions, and beliefs of the Philippines, which helped me to appreciate my own heritage.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Rizal's writings also helped me to develop a sense of social responsibility. Rizal was not only a writer, but also a reformer who advocated for the rights of the Filipino people. His example of standing up for what is right, even in the face of oppression, has inspired me to become more engaged in the issues that affect my community and to take action to make a difference.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has changed me in many ways. It has broadened my understanding of Philippine history and culture, and has inspired me to become more socially responsible. Rizal's legacy continues to be a source of inspiration for all Filipinos, and I am proud to be a part of that legacy.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My first thought was why not study Rizal? But I know that’s not what you are looking for in an answer. The reason to study anything is to broaden your education and Rizal is an extremely important individual in Philippine history. It is said that his writing influenced the drive to independence in that country. He was not physically part of the revolution but he was still executed because of his influence.I also wondered if your question had to do with a homework assignment so I’m limiting my answer because I don’t want to do your homework for you.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana maka tulong diko alam ko tama Basta yan na tenk you:)</p><p></p><br />
