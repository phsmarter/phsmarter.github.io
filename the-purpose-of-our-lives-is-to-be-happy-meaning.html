2&quot;Our virtues are not mental faculties. Rather, these are character traits. It is the human being&#039;s ability to see to it that his or her action is neither excessive nor inadequate, and as such, is geared towards finding some form of harmonization.&quot;&quot;Happiness is something that is desirable in itself. There is no other
3.value that attains the ultimate nature of happiness. All other things are merely requirements for happiness.&quot; &quot;Life is worth living when we shall have discovered our very

                            1. II. Explain the following statements:
1. "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes its birth and growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit.
2"Our virtues are not mental faculties. Rather, these are character traits. It is the human being's ability to see to it that his or her action is neither excessive nor inadequate, and as such, is geared towards finding some form of harmonization.""Happiness is something that is desirable in itself. There is no other
3.value that attains the ultimate nature of happiness. All other things are merely requirements for happiness." "Life is worth living when we shall have discovered our very
4.purpose. The very value of life comes from this purpose. To realize this value means to realize our happiness."</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>1. Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes its existence and growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit. From this it is clear that none of the moral virtues arises in us by nature; for nothing that exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature. For instance the stone which by nature moves downwards cannot be habituated to move upwards, not even if one tries to train it by throwing it up ten thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to move downwards, nor can anything else that by nature behaves in one way be trained to behave in another. Neither by nature, then, nor contrary to nature do the virtues arise in us; rather we are adapted by nature to receive them, and are made perfect by habit.</p><p></p><p>2. Our virtues are not just mere mental faculties, but rather they are character traits that define who we truly are. These traits are developed through our actions and experiences, and it is up to us to cultivate them. It is the human being's ability to choose and act upon these virtues that sets us apart from other creatures.</p><p></p><p>3. The ultimate nature of happiness lies in the value that we attach to it. All other things are merely requirements for happiness. True happiness cannot be found in material possessions or external circumstances, but rather in our own mindset and perspective towards life. It is a state of being that is attainable through inner peace and contentment.</p><p></p><p>4. Purpose is the driving force behind our existence. It gives meaning to our lives and shapes our actions. Without purpose, life would be meaningless and directionless. To truly understand the value of life, we must first discover our purpose and work towards fulfilling it. Only then can we realize our full potential and find true fulfillment in life.</p><br />
