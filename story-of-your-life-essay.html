My parents have nurtured me, guided me and comforted me. They hold the opinions I trust the most. They constantly inspire me to achieve.One of my earliest life lessons was that you become who you hang out with, and this doesn’t change when you get older. I’ve always tried to be friendly to everyone I meet, but at the same time I’ve also become picker about who I spend the majority of my time with. I’ve learned to spot certain positive qualities in people, and seek these qualities out. I’ve also learned to avoid other characteristics. The people closest to you will influence you in many ways so I think it’s important to be selective, especially at an important time in your life when you are building the foundation for your career and making other important life decisions. Surround yourself with people who inspire you and make you a better person. Some friends come and go but the ones who have stayed have had a huge impact on my decisions and happiness. They have supported me and cheered me on and they have shaped me into the person I have become.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Hope</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it's </strong><strong>help</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A comic strip is a sequence of drawings, often cartoon, arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th and into the 21st century, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with daily horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in newspapers, while Sunday papers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the advent of the internet, online comic strips began to appear as webcomics.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the best ways to share your faith is to live a godly life. Non-Christians often look at Christians as hypocritical because we say one thing but do another. Show those close to you that you care—spend time with them, help meet their needs and offer to listen when they have problems. You might not be able to answer all of their questions, but they can’t deny the reality of what Christ has done in your life. If you find this is hard to do, perhaps God is speaking to you about your own need to walk more closely with Him every day.
</p><p>
</p><p>Another important part of sharing your faith is to pray for those you interact with. If you can’t think of anyone who isn’t a Christian, pray for God to place someone in your life who needs Him.
</p><p>
</p><p>Also make a habit of reading the Bible, praying and going to church. (Read more about diving into your walk with God through prayer, Scripture and relationships.) These things shouldn’t be done for attention or for the sake of doing them, but to help you grow in your own faith. Being passionate about Christ will help others see that there’s something different about you, and they will want to know what it is. You can also reflect Christ through kind words, patience, a gentle temperament, choosing to love even difficult people, carefully monitoring what you watch or listen to, and treating others with respect.
</p><p>
</p><p>At the same time, we must do more than live godly lives. People need to hear the Gospel—to hear that God loves them, Christ died for them and that they can have eternal life. Romans 10:13-14 says, “‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’ How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i search sorry thats all i got</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>My New-found Interest</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>A few years ago, I have discovered that <strong>I like reading books</strong>, especially ones that are more obscure and unique. I discovered this when I visited our school library for some reference material. I do not usually go to the library, as almost all information that I need can already be found on the internet. But during that time, I needed to have a hardcopy reference. Therefore, I spent some time in the library. Who knew that it could actually lead it to my love for reading? I did not realize yet that time it was actually the beginning.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Magical Moment</strong>
</p><p>I remember that I was looking for a particular science book for my reference. It was crunch time already with my report, so I must find that science reference. However, while I was looking, I came across this old book about a young girl and her desire to have a swimming pool in their backyard. The book cover was nondescript, just an image of a young girl in pig tails. It was hard bound with olive green color and smelled really old and musty. I am not sure why I started reading it, but I actually did! And I was so excited about it! Eventually I was able to find my science reference and borrowed my new-found book together with it. </p><p></p><p><strong>My Future Career?</strong>
</p><p>Until today I kept asking myself, why did I ever get interested to open that book in the library? Was there some magical moment or some divine intervention leading me to that book? But in any case, that incident got me started into reading. After that, I would visit the library to look for other similar books. Furthermore, it developed in me an inclination to look online for books with good reviews. And I get to spend many days in bookstores in malls. There are bookstores that allow people to stay inside, lounge in the store, and read some books. I like doing that in some of my free time. Also, I have this feeling that I must at least read one physical book for every five online books I read. I also started following online writing platforms and fanfiction websites. I needed to see which ones are new releases and if they are actually good. Nowadays I am getting interested in pursuing creative writing. I want to learn how to be a creative writer. Who knows! One day that might be a career I am willing to take in the future.
