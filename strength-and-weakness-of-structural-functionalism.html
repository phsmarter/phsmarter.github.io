                            1. study the strength and weaknesses of structural functionalism​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Structural functionalism is a sociological perspective that focuses on the role of society in shaping individual behavior and social norms. This theory takes the view that society is a complex system made up of various interdependent parts, each with its own unique function, and that the system works together to maintain social stability and order. Here are some strengths and weaknesses of structural functionalism:</p><p></p><p>Strengths:</p><p></p><p>1. Systemic View: Structural functionalism takes a systemic view of society, analyzing how different parts of it work together to maintain stability and harmony. It considers interdependence of social institutions to derive order and stability in the society.</p><p></p><p>2. Emphasis on Social Order: Structural functionalism places a strong emphasis on social order and stability. It is argued that stability and cohesion are essential for the smooth functioning of society, ensuring that people can work together effectively.</p><p></p><p>3. Useful for Macro-level Analysis: Structural functionalism offers a broad and comprehensive perspective to assess social phenomena. It is particularly useful when studying macro-level phenomena such as social inequality, stratification, and power relationships.</p><p></p><p>4. Integrative: Structural functionalism is integrative as it recognizes multiple interests and roles of individuals over an extended period. In this regard, functionalism offers a functionalist view of the society that takes everyone's interests and needs into account.</p><p></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p></p><p>1. Limited Perspective: Structural functionalism has a limited perspective as it fails to recognize the potential for social change and conflict. It does not acknowledge the importance of societal tensions and conflicts in shaping the social structure.</p><p></p><p>2. Conservative: Critics argue that structural functionalism is conservative because it tends to justify the status quo and works to maintain the basic structure of society without addressing or acknowledging inequalities and injustices of social life.</p><p></p><p>3. Ignores the Role of Power: Critics argue that structural functionalism overlooks the role of power in shaping social behavior, particularly how power dynamics play out in social institutions and relations.</p><p></p><p>4. Limited in Application: It is often limited in application because of its systemic view. This view may neglect or ignore the unique features of individual interactions and actions.</p><p></p><p>In summary Structural functionalism provides a systemic view of society, highlighting interdependence, social order, and stability. However, it is conservative, limited in application, and overlooks the importance of conflict and power relationships.</p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliests </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>thank </strong><strong>you </strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Strength: </p><p></p><p>The functionalist approach illustrates how a social institution can work at two different levels - both fulfilling the needs of each individual and meeting the needs of the whole society at the same time</p><p></p><p>Weakness: </p><p>The functionalist approach is too optimistic. It suggests that family life</p><p>Is always good and happy. Cheal (2002) claims that functional relationships can easily slip into damaging relationships. Child abuse is a major social problem in the UK - 1 in 14 children have been physically abused, according to NSPCC in 2011.</p><p></p><p>Strength:</p><p></p><p>Functionalists show how each of the parts of society are interrelated, each contributing to the well-being of society.</p><p></p><p>Weakness:</p><p></p><p>This perspective tends to ignore the conflict and exploitation stressed by Marxists.</p><p></p><p>Strength:</p><p></p><p>It provides a very harmonious view of society and the family.</p><p></p><p>Weakness: </p><p></p><p>By stressing the idea that the nuclear family is universal, this approach ignores other types of Family and household and seems to assume that they are inadequate, such as:</p><p>       Lone-parent families and matrifocal families. However, many people still have a desire to live in the kind of nuclear households outlined by Murdock and Parsons. Also many social policy initiatives stemming from conservative politicians have their origin in functionalist theories.</p><p></p><p>Strength:</p><p></p><p>This approach stresses the great importance of the family, as it is a basic building block of society.</p><p></p><p>Weakness: </p><p></p><p>It does not consider the ways in which functions may be performed by other institutions, such as the education system,</p><p>Rather than by the family. Fletcher (1988) argues that Parsons was wrong to suggest that the family had lost its functions during industrialisation, as it still continues to provide social, economic and educational support.</p><p></p><p>Strength: </p><p></p><p>The family is seen as very important in passing on the shared norms and values which are universal in society.</p><p></p><p>Weakness: </p><p>Feminists are critical of this approach because it assumes that gender roles are fixed, ignoring the changes that have taken place.</p><p></p><p>Feminists also argue that the family serves the needs of men and oppresses women.</p><p></p><br />

There is so much inequality and diversity between cultures that there is no way that cultures could drivesociety.</p><p></p><p>Functionalism.
