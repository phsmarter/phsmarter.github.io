                                            The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</a>

Americans ages 18 to 29 are considered to be less religious than older Americans. According to recent studies by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, fewer young adults are affiliated with a specific religion than older people today. And, compared with their elders, fewer young people say that religion is very important in their lives. Yet, many young people still believe in traditional religious concepts and practices. Pew Research Center surveys show, for example, that “young adults’ beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven, hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today.” According to GSS (General Social Survey) results from a random sample of 1,679 subjects, 756 in the 18–29 age group pray daily (an increase of 5% over the 1990s), while 55% pray less often. .

                            7. The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</h2><br />

Americans ages 18 to 29 are considered to be less religious than older Americans. According to recent studies by the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, fewer young adults are affiliated with a specific religion than older people today. And, compared with their elders, fewer young people say that religion is very important in their lives. Yet, many young people still believe in traditional religious concepts and practices. Pew Research Center surveys show, for example, that “young adults’ beliefs about life after death and the existence of heaven, hell and miracles closely resemble the beliefs of older people today.” According to GSS (General Social Survey) results from a random sample of 1,679 subjects, 756 in the 18–29 age group pray daily (an increase of 5% over the 1990s), while 55% pray less often. .

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“Formalism” is, as the name implies, an interpretive approach that emphasizes literary form and the study of literary devices within the text. The name “formalism” was chosen by opponents of the literary movement who considered the approach controversially structured and formal. The critics wondered why the author’s sociopolitical positioning was ignored yet it was the main source of insights and motivation during composition. According to the formalists’ argument, formalism was an attractive approach since one could devise a methodology that was applicable across a wide cross-section of literary works, regardless of geographical or historical considerations. “Formalism,” like “structuralism,” sought to place the study of literature ona scientific basis through objective analysis of the motifs, devices, techniques, and other “functions” that comprise the literary work. The formalists placed great importance on the literariness of texts, those qualities that distinguished the literary from other kinds of writing. Neither author nor context was essential for the formalists; it was the narrative that spoke, the “hero-function,” for example, that had meaning. Form was the content. A plot device or narrative strategy was examined for how it functioned and compared to how it had functioned in other literary works.</p><p></p><p> </p><br />

                            18. What is the conclusion of globalization of religion</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The conclusion of the globalization of <strong>religion is complex and debated among scholars.</strong> Some argue that globalization has led to the spread of religion beyond its traditional borders, allowing for greater diversity and the emergence of new religious movements. Others argue that globalization has led to the homogenization of religious practices and beliefs, with the dominant global religions exerting greater influence and power over local and indigenous religions. Additionally, <strong>globalization has created new challenges for religious institutions, such as adapting to new cultures and technological advances, and has also created new opportunities for interfaith dialogue and cooperation.</strong> Ultimately, the impact of globalization on religion varies depending on the particular religion, region, and context in question.</p><p></p><p>The conclusion of the globalization of religion is a complex and multifaceted topic that can be approached from various perspectives. On one hand, globalization has facilitated the spread of religious beliefs and practices across geographic, cultural, and ethnic boundaries, leading to increased religious diversity and syncretism. This has allowed people to exchange ideas and experiences, promoting greater understanding and tolerance among different faiths.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, globalization has also led to the commodification and commercialization of religion, with some religious groups using it as a tool to gain power or influence. Additionally, globalization has also been accompanied by the rise of religious fundamentalism, which has led to conflicts and tensions between different religious groups.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the impact of globalization on religion depends on various factors, such as the specific religious traditions involved, the political and economic context in which they operate, and the attitudes and behaviors of the people who practice them. While globalization has undoubtedly had both positive and negative effects on religion, its ultimate impact on religious practice and belief will continue to evolve over time. </p><p></p>#keeponlearning<p>&lt;33</p><br />

                            30. conclusion of origins of religion​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>       Just as scholars have come to recognize the contemporary diversity among religions in today’s society, so, if basic human rights of freedom of belief and practice are to be maintained, it becomes essential that old stereotypes of just what constitutes religion should be relinquished. In a culturally pluralistic world, religion, like other social phenomena, may take many forms. Just what is a religion cannot be determined by the application of concepts drawn from any one particular tradition. Only a higher degree of abstraction, superordinate to each particular culture and each particular religion, can encompass within one framework of reference the range of diversity of actual religious movements. Just as the concrete phenomena of one particular religion cannot be allowed to dictate the necessary style of other faiths, so, too, the language employed needs, as far as is possible, to be uncontaminated by specific cultural connotations. It is to this end, and in the interests of equity in transactions concerning religions, that the probabilistic inventory that is set out above [Section 11] was advanced. Only with such a device, consciously constructed both to recognize the evolutionary character of religion and to subsume under independent categories the various facets of thought and practice, is it likely that the wide variety of contemporary religion will receive the consideration that is its due.</p><br />
