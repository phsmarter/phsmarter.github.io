                            5. Illustrate and relate Filipino culture based on Fernando Amorsolo’s painting “PLANTING RICE”​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Search on Gogle planting rice </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>basahin mo po lamat po sa points</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PLANTING RICE (1951) By Fernando Amorsolo</p><p>Posted on November 1, 2014 by pensivemindsniche</p><p>Standard</p><p>PLANTING RICE (1951) By Fernando Amorsolo</p><p>Mimetic – with respect to the Subject Matter</p><p>This painting I believe is a representational art as it portrays something other than its form. This painting falls under the classification of painting as Genre painting as it is painted in the contemporary life of the Filipino farmers in 1951, when it was painted, as they are engaged in their regular every-day occupation and activities. Behind the workers, a farmer with a carabao ploughs. In the background is a cluster of nipa huts along the thick accumulation of trees and weeds. The central grouping of lush trees and hills provides an idyllic setting for the workers besides a mountain view or background. I think this painting basically captures the traditional Filipino occupation of the farm life of men and women in a hot sunny day. It depicts how enduring they are and how the farmers work together. It portrays a provincial setting in which the farmers wear traditional clothes for farming in the 1950s and captures that fashion as I think if a modern artist would draw with a similar subject, women farmers will not be wearing skirts or the traditional look of women back then as time has changed. The painting is very Filipino with respect to the subject matter. The subject matter itself defines the aesthetic qualities of this painting relating it to the period in which it is created to appreciate more its overall beauty.</p><p></p><p>Expressive – with respect to the Artist</p><p>I would say that this painting has a relationship with Amorsolo. His works usually depicts people and barrio scenes of the Philippines. Those paintings of the nationalistic, the true character, smiles, emotions or feelings and spirits </p><p></p><p>He also spent his childhood in the province of Camarines Norte in which I believe affected the subject matter of his paintings as provincial, tropical etc. He is also soft-spoken and his works tells a little bit of himself as he puts his self in the painting depicting a peaceful life, quietly doing his job as a source of living (painting and farming).</p><p></p><p>PRAGMATIC – with respect to the AUDIENCE</p><p>My self is an audience to the work of Amorsolo. The perceived value, importance, function or significance of this painting is the aesthetic appreciation I give to it. The surface look is beautiful as first glance, as I cannot paint as realistically as Amorsolo paints. The underlying values are sentimentality with respects to the subject matter as very Filipino depiction of a scene familiar to all Filipinos. I believe the painting aims to teach or to deliver some value to an audience especially if he or she is a foreigner. He or she would interpret the painting as showing the endurance, hard work and the lifestyle of the Filipinos. In short it gives a glimpse of the Filipino culture in one aspect such as the farm life. The agricultural means, worker, animals, equipments, huts, clothes, weather, irrigation and etc. are visibly in the painting that I think would give an idea to the audience. It may not be appreciated by a great number of audiences such as the mass considered as uneducated or unenlightened therefore, cannot appreciate or critically analyze a painting in an overall assessment of its value and importance, yet they may appreciate and understand it casually. I think one of primary values of this painting is simply to contribute to the usage of the sense of sight of the audiences which are us, the Filipinos, to simply appreciate a work of art that does not need science but to humanize us, just using free judgment and leaving the more specific details to the experts as a form of advance studies for Art students. This ‘Planting Rice”, a typical theme to paint by many Filipino artists, but beyond that, the several versions proves that it is not only painted because of the simplicity but the underlying significance to our culture.</p><p></p><p> </p><br />
