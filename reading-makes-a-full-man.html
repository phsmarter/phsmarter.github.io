                                            Activity 1. MY FIRST IMPRESSION Read the sample movie critique and analyze each part according to the structure of writing a critique. A. Label the part of the critique. 1. The Dark Knight 2. 3. In this new Batman movie he can swoop over the city all he likes, but he gets no pleasure from meeting out justice. The genius of The Dark Knight is that Christopher Nolan, the film's director and pro- ducer, has not only produced an amazing comic book movie but also one with an intellectual heart. Heath Ledger, as The Joker, delivers a great performance. With his face full of clown paint and his mouth a blurred slash of red, The Joker is the embod- iment of anarchy and anti-order. He carries bombs in his pocket and slashes people's faces. Ledger is so terrifying his very presence on screen makes you hor- ribly nervous. Ledger shouldn't obscure the brilliance of the other performances, most notably Aaron Eck- hart as prosecutor Harvey Dent and Christian Bale as Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal brings some welcome spike to her character, Rachel. Michael Caine refines Alfred, Batman's butler and Gary Oldman as police commissioner Gordon. Buses crash, hospital are detonated, car chas- es are conducted at a shocking velocity, the epic de- sign of the movie is a character its own right but there, right at the heart, lies the question of what Bat- man is for, and whether his presence brings more danger that it does safety. For a superhero Batman doesn't have much fun. The gadgets, the under- ground cave, the superb car that transforms itself in- to an armored tank and a turbo-motorcycle - all of this counts for nothing because he is such a misery, torn between good and bad, what he is supposed to be, his responsibilities, his frustrated for the g geous Rachel Dawes. The Dark Knight will stun and surprise you, delight and terrify you. It won't be the special effects or bat-heroics which will keep you pinned to your seat, but the moral force of the script and an ending which takes our hero, unbelievably and brilliantly, to even darker realms 4.​</a>

                                            An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the "SAME SEX MARRIAGE "that is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals. Father Nael: (Priest) It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society) It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay) I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way. Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian) It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay) If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy. After reading the six arguments on the given issues above, which do you think the best argument and why? Write your answer in your Reflection notebook.​</a>

Greetings from Maldives! It is my second day here, and I hope for a fun adventure! Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw some sea turtles and coral reefs. I never expected the water to be that crystal clear! Too bad I can't bring any corals home. Today, we will go dolphin spotting at Cinnamon Hakurra and do some island hopping. How's your trip going? Can't wait to see you when we get back. I wish you were here. Miss you! We are here tonight to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Mario Angeles, who has been serving our company for the past 20 years. He is a hardworking man who never failed to give a smile as he sees everyone along the halls. He is a father who is never tired of supporting his two daughters’ and son’s dreams and is successful in doing so. Mr. Angeles does not fail to be optimistic if there are problems along the way and would always cheer us up when we need it. Put three large egg yolks and finely grated parmesan cheese into a bowl. Season it with pepper and mix it well with a fork. Leave it on the side. Then, cook pancetta and crushed garlic on a medium frying pan in medium-high heat. Once the oil is rendered, remove the garlic and add cooked spaghetti and toss it over the heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add a splash of pasta water, season it with pepper, and add the egg and cheese mixture made earlier. Toss it well and add more pasta water until it looks glossy. Serve it with more parmesan cheese and cracked pepper. The problem, however, is that in interpreting and understanding literary texts, the use of one literary term or theory to focus on sometimes bring out more questions and clarifications in the text that should be answered. The tendency now is to look for more answers by looking at another theory that will answer these unclear interpretations. Then it also brings more questions, and so on. This paper aims to prove that through the use of different literary theories and various literary terms, the literary text is explored to its full potential without disrespecting the text itself and at the same time it also brings out a better appreciation of the meaning of the text read.​</a>

So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders.

She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut. Underthe kitchen floor was a hidden basement where food was stored Theson hid his mother in there. He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time. Finally, helifted his head and said, "Shining needs more than strength and youthI forgot the old saying.

And I find that in curiosity of knowing he is the same; he cuts himself out more work than he can do, and more than he needs to do: extending the utility of knowledge, to the full of its matter: "Ut omnium rerum, sic litter arum quoque, intemperantia labors us."

Javier In a faraway mountain, there was a happy couple Ethel and Ariel living together with a very simple life. They used to live in a NIPA hut, eat foods from their farm, and catch fishes from the river. The husband was a farmer working all day at the farm. He always prayed that someday the Almighty Father will give them a child which is the only thing they wished for. One night, when they were sleeping, they heard a horrible sound from the surrounding. When the husband was awakened, he looked where it came from Surprisingly a bright light flashed on her eyes and he saw a beautiful fairy smiling at him. "Good Man", the fairy said." You've been working so hard in the farm, taking good care of your wife. I want to give you a simple gift for all your kindness. When the farmer heard her offer, he was terribly happy with tears saying, "I want to have a child". And the fairy just smiled at him and said" Your wish is granted" she immediately disappeared. From that moment he gave all the needs of her wife. He brought her fruits and fresh vegetables every day from the farm. He didn't let her wife worked and feel tired because he loved her so much. Moments passed by, when her wife cooked foods for him, she was really in pain because she was able to deliver her baby. The husband was very aggressive to see her baby and it was very successful. At last her wife gave birth to a very beautiful baby and they named her Fairysha. The name was originally got from the Fairy who gave them gift The baby girl grew full of love with their parents and also, they thought her to be kind always and God fearing. And they lived happlly as a perfect family. YOUR SUMMARY​</a>

                                            Read the excerpt below:
An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind
aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making
decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it
should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas
which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine
several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the SAME SEX MARRIAGE that
is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals.
Father Nael: (Priest)
It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a
sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the
commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.
Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)
It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children?
Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake.
Mr. Serge: (Gay)
I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And
I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.
Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)
It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot
resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and
feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or
have married legally.
Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)
If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is
meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their
relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.

                            4. Activity 1. MY FIRST IMPRESSION Read the sample movie critique and analyze each part according to the structure of writing a critique. A. Label the part of the critique. 1. The Dark Knight 2. 3. In this new Batman movie he can swoop over the city all he likes, but he gets no pleasure from meeting out justice. The genius of The Dark Knight is that Christopher Nolan, the film's director and pro- ducer, has not only produced an amazing comic book movie but also one with an intellectual heart. Heath Ledger, as The Joker, delivers a great performance. With his face full of clown paint and his mouth a blurred slash of red, The Joker is the embod- iment of anarchy and anti-order. He carries bombs in his pocket and slashes people's faces. Ledger is so terrifying his very presence on screen makes you hor- ribly nervous. Ledger shouldn't obscure the brilliance of the other performances, most notably Aaron Eck- hart as prosecutor Harvey Dent and Christian Bale as Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal brings some welcome spike to her character, Rachel. Michael Caine refines Alfred, Batman's butler and Gary Oldman as police commissioner Gordon. Buses crash, hospital are detonated, car chas- es are conducted at a shocking velocity, the epic de- sign of the movie is a character its own right but there, right at the heart, lies the question of what Bat- man is for, and whether his presence brings more danger that it does safety. For a superhero Batman doesn't have much fun. The gadgets, the under- ground cave, the superb car that transforms itself in- to an armored tank and a turbo-motorcycle - all of this counts for nothing because he is such a misery, torn between good and bad, what he is supposed to be, his responsibilities, his frustrated for the g geous Rachel Dawes. The Dark Knight will stun and surprise you, delight and terrify you. It won't be the special effects or bat-heroics which will keep you pinned to your seat, but the moral force of the script and an ending which takes our hero, unbelievably and brilliantly, to even darker realms 4.​</h2><br />

                            5. An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the "SAME SEX MARRIAGE "that is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals. Father Nael: (Priest) It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society) It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay) I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way. Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian) It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay) If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy. After reading the six arguments on the given issues above, which do you think the best argument and why? Write your answer in your Reflection notebook.​</h2><br />

Greetings from Maldives! It is my second day here, and I hope for a fun adventure! Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw some sea turtles and coral reefs. I never expected the water to be that crystal clear! Too bad I can't bring any corals home. Today, we will go dolphin spotting at Cinnamon Hakurra and do some island hopping. How's your trip going? Can't wait to see you when we get back. I wish you were here. Miss you! We are here tonight to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Mario Angeles, who has been serving our company for the past 20 years. He is a hardworking man who never failed to give a smile as he sees everyone along the halls. He is a father who is never tired of supporting his two daughters’ and son’s dreams and is successful in doing so. Mr. Angeles does not fail to be optimistic if there are problems along the way and would always cheer us up when we need it. Put three large egg yolks and finely grated parmesan cheese into a bowl. Season it with pepper and mix it well with a fork. Leave it on the side. Then, cook pancetta and crushed garlic on a medium frying pan in medium-high heat. Once the oil is rendered, remove the garlic and add cooked spaghetti and toss it over the heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add a splash of pasta water, season it with pepper, and add the egg and cheese mixture made earlier. Toss it well and add more pasta water until it looks glossy. Serve it with more parmesan cheese and cracked pepper. The problem, however, is that in interpreting and understanding literary texts, the use of one literary term or theory to focus on sometimes bring out more questions and clarifications in the text that should be answered. The tendency now is to look for more answers by looking at another theory that will answer these unclear interpretations. Then it also brings more questions, and so on. This paper aims to prove that through the use of different literary theories and various literary terms, the literary text is explored to its full potential without disrespecting the text itself and at the same time it also brings out a better appreciation of the meaning of the text read.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

He always prayed that someday the Almighty Father will give them a child which is the only thing they wished for. One night, when they were sleeping, they heard a horrible sound from the surrounding. When the husband was awakened, he looked where it came from Surprisingly a bright light flashed on her eyes and he saw a beautiful fairy smiling at him. "Good Man", the fairy said." You've been working so hard in the farm, taking good care of your wife. I want to give you a simple gift for all your kindness.

                            24. Read the excerpt below:
An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind
aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making
decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it
should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas
which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine
several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the SAME SEX MARRIAGE that
is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals.
Father Nael: (Priest)
It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a
sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the
commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.
Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)
It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children?
Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake.
Mr. Serge: (Gay)
I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And
I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.
Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)
It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot
resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and
feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or
have married legally.
Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)
If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is
meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their
relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.
Activity 2: My Personal Insights:
After reading the six arguments on the given issues above, which do you think the best argument
and why? Write your answer in your Reflection notebook.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The priest's argument is based from the Bible.</p><p></p><p>Casiana's argument is based on what is accepted in society.</p><p></p><p>The G*y's argument are based from what is secured as legal.</p><p></p><p>The l*sbian's argument is also based on what is legal.</p><p></p><p>Jennifer's argument is based from what her gay son will do or feel.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the G*y's argument is the best for me even though they have the same concept with lesbian because the Gay's argument is short but clearly delivered and comprehensive.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The g*y is telling that marriage is the only way to make a two couple legal. That is why he said, he secured and have a peace of mind, cause they will not think what the society will tell them for being together. Also, I think LG*Ts argument is the most valid since they are the one who will experience this thing and not other people.</p><p></p><p><strong>Pabrainliest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>po.</strong></p><br />
