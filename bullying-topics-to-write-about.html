                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>bullying</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Bullying is when someone is rude or mean to another person. The people who bully other people are called bullies. Anybody can be bullied, even a group of people. There are many different kinds of bullying. Bullying does not always mean hitting people. It can also be things that people say. </p><p><strong>Bullying</strong> includes when people see what happens, but they don't do anything about it. When people who see bullying know what to do and they do it, they can help make a bad situation better.</p><p>It's also <strong>bullying</strong> when other people hide it from those who can help (teachers, bosses), when other people see it but ignore it, or when a person helps the bully to do it without getting in trouble.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>When someone or many people scare, abuse or dominate other person, it is called bullying. This can happen in school, office, street or at home. Such behaviour is a habit of some people and so they do it again and again. Bullying is very common for children in schools.</p><p></p><p> “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.”</p><p></p><p>Bullying can be verbal in which children make fun of others, call them by bad names, spread rumours about them. It can be physical in which they hit others or destroy their things. It can also happen on phone or computer when someone uses dirty language or send bad pictures or messages. Intentionally making someone feel alone is also bullying. Bullying is growing a lot in our society nowadays. It affects students and people badly and many times it also affects their health. One loses confidence when one is bullied. The person starts being alone and stops talking to others. It affects his studies and his health. Some children start suffering from depression and they can also commit suicide.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

It can manifest in various forms, including physical, verbal, and social bullying.</p><p> </p><p>Research suggests that children who experience bullying are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Teachers and parents must work together to create a safe and inclusive classroom environment that promotes positive behavior and prevents bullying.</p><p></p><p> Interventions such as peer mentoring programs and anti-bullying policies can be effective in reducing the incidence of bullying in the classroom.</p><br />

Bullying is something that should be talked more often cause it can lead to kids becoming s**cidal or end up harming themselves. We should learn to speak up for people who aren't able to speak up for themselves due to lack of self confidence and fear of getting hurt.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When someone or many people scare, abuse or dominate other person, it is called bullying. This can happen in school, office, street or at home. Such behaviour is a habit of some people and so they do it again and again. Bullying is very common for children in schools.</p><p></p><p>Bullying can be verbal in which children make fun of others, call them bad names, and spread rumours about them. It can be physical in which they hit others or destroy their things. It can also happen on a phone or computer when someone uses dirty language or send bad pictures or messages. Intentionally making someone feel alone is also bullying.</p><p></p><p>There are many reasons which lead to bullying. Sometimes children who bully are jealous of others. They cannot see anyone doing better than them and so they start bullying others. Some bully because they were bullied by someone else earlier. Such children try to take revenge by doing the same to others to feel powerful now. Others bully because they are not happy with themselves. They may have some physical or mental problem and they try to take out their anger by bullying others.</p><p></p><p>Bullying is growing a lot in our society nowadays. It affects students and people badly and many times it also affects their health. One loses confidence when one is bullied. The person starts being alone and stops talking to others. It affects his studies and his health. Some children start suffering from depression and they can also commit suicide.</p><p></p><p>Bullying is very harmful and there are many ways to prevent it. Parents and teachers should always try to be friendly with children. This makes them comfortable and they start sharing their feelings. They should also talk to the child who bullies others and know the reason. Parents should teach good manners and behaviours to their children. They must tell them that they should respect others and become friends with everyone.</p><p></p><p>What are the types of Bullying?</p><p>Physical bullying</p><p>Social Bullying</p><p>Cyber Bullying</p><p>Psychological Bullying</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p>utot mo  the pragmatic <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying can happen at any stage of life, such as school bullying, College bullying, Workplace bullying, Public Place bullying, etc. Many times not only the other persons but the family members or parents also unknowingly bully an individual by making constant discouraging remarks. Hence the victim gradually starts losing his/her self-esteem, and may also suffer from psychological disorders.</p><p></p><p>A UNESCO report says that 32% of students are bullied at schools worldwide. In our country as well, bullying is becoming quite common. Instead, bullying is becoming a major problem worldwide.

                        Bullying is an issue that has been affecting many in the world today. It takes place in many forms some of which are direct and include physical harm on the victim. Verbal bullying involves name calling and insults or threats being directed at the victim and may also involve emotional bullying where the victim’s emotions are targeted by the bully. Other forms of bullying may be indirect where the harm is not caused by the person directly but it still ends up affecting the person.<br /><br />Bullying is termed as a form of abuse that uses power and dominance to those that are weaker and less powerful. Bullying has been taking place in various areas but it is mostly common in schools and workplaces. It exists in various social groups, social classes and is found all over the world. The behavior is usually repetitive and aggressive and it is based on the sole intention of hurting the victim. Bullies carry out the behavior to harm the other person as a way of gaining power over the other person. It is normally a behavior that is planned and purposeful.<br /><br />Bullying in schools has become very common and it has led to some very serious consequences. It has led to physical violence in forms of fight and in some extreme cases deaths by suicides. Cases have emerged of some forms of bullying in the schools that have led to some of these severe consequences. Children who are victims have had to live with short term and long term consequences of the behavior. Some of the other effects include poor performance in their studies, depression, bedwetting, being withdrawn, changing schools regularly and is some cases suicides among others (Norfolk, n.d).  Over 7% of children especially in the 8th grade tend to stay at home once a month since they are bullied in schools (Banks, 1997). Reports have also shown that about 15% of students are bullied on a regular basis with some being initiated into the bullying practice. Direct bullying is more common among boys than with the girls. However, physical abuse in boys tends to reduce as they progress in age. The victims of bullying sometimes carry these effects such as depression and low self-esteem into their adulthood.<br /><br />Bullying is a serious problem that is affecting the academic and social lives of the school going children. In order to understand the problem and develop an intervention plan that can be used to stop it, it is important to identify the various forms of bullying that are going on within the schools and the trends they are taking. It is also important to understand how they have carried out and the effects that arise from the practice. This will help develop a plan that will be able to establish a safe and secure environment in the schools for all children.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Bullying is a global problem that influences people of each and every age and backgrounds. According to the World Health Organization, bullying is a not unusualplace trouble in plenty of countries, with estimates suggesting that as plenty as one to third of kids and children report being bullied at school. In addition, bullying additionally can arise withinside the workplace, online, and interior communities.</strong></p><p><strong>Claim of Fact:</strong></p><p><strong>The first declare approximately bullying is a declare of fact, which states that bullying is a risky habits which can have long-lasting terrible effects. Research has validated that bullying can cause more than a few negative outcomes, inclusive of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation.

                            27. Write a comic strip about bullying to help anyone who is being bullied</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:A lot of kids are dreading that a new school year is beginning, and it has nothing to do with schoolwork.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Instead, it’s because school is where, for them, the bully or bullies are.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Sometimes it helps if the ideas for remedies to a problem come from an unexpected source. In my experience, that way kids are more likely to take notice.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>That’s why I like “Bullying Is No Laughing Matter” (Front Edge Publishing, $15). This 8½x11 paperback has 36 artists coming together to discuss bullying through their comic strips. Comics are accessible, kid-friendly, a comfortable spot to discuss a difficult subject.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In the first part, different comic book artists show panels of their strips where they’ve taken on bullying from a number of different perspectives. There also are essays where the artists provide encouragement and sometimes tell their own memories of being bullied as a child. Some are pretty funny, like Broom-Hilda’s (Russell Myers) solution to the bully taking a kid’s lunch. Others are poignant and show bullying takes many forms, like being the kid who is excluded, as Stone Soup (Jan Eliot) illustrates. Mama’s Boyz (Jerry Craft) offers a reminder that sometimes kids don’t even know they are being bullies.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When you flip it over, there is an entire graphic novel dealing with bullying starring college-age super hero The Cardinal. (It’s written with an older child or teen in mind.) The Cardinal’s creator, Kurt J. Kolka, tells his experience with bullies and candidly looks at the situation. Kolka tells readers that in looking back, he sees that telling a trusted adult could have helped him. (Also, one of the threads through that story is inspired by the real-life bullying story of Camille Paddock, 2014 Miss Teen Illinois International, who shares what happened to her as well.)
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>This is a good resource for a child who is being bullied as well as those who are not. Sometimes bullying persists because other kids don’t know how to stand up to the bully without becoming the next target. It would be a great classroom or school library resource as well.

                        <p>Bullying is one of the primary cases why some students get into suicide or trouble. Bullying makes us people vulnerable. Bullying can carry a premiere disease if it will continue functioning in our country. We all know that because of bullying, we can hear in the news that many wanted to kill their life. Instead of bullying anyone, why don't we get them to be friends? </p><p><br /></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a citizen of this country, we must united in conducting a policy or law (bills or rights) that under the Philippines government premises that No more bullying. And as we heard some issues about this, many of us were quarrel. But we must stop the Bullying even in Social Medias because it can only create a chaos in our society. Those who are bullying must accompanied with some consequences or sanctions. We encouraged students or even the people of this society to love one another as a good citizen. We disciplined them according to the laws of this government and do not tolerate those persons who are bullying. We must be creative in implementing laws or bills about bullying. Also in the way that we must take care our people as our own child or children because we pledged to them to protect every citizen of this society. Most of those people who are bullying are the most vulnerable in all because somehow they can't feel the love in their own houses or any discipline. That is why they bullied their fellow countrymen or even classmates in school or anyone they can. We must not tolerate this kind of behavior in our country; we must discipline them according to the laws.
</p><p><br /></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Bullying can kill a life. It can hurt someone's emotion or feelings. We must not one of a bully because even if it is a word only but you can kill someone. It is a murder. Bully is not only a scene or drama but it can affects one's character. We may be one of a bully in school or in any occasions, we must stop it now. As a popular quotes states that, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".</p><p>
