  3. During his trip to the main agency, he was advised to seek help from its attached agency that is responsible for marketing and promoting the Philippines as a major global tourism destination.
  This agency will teach him how to market and promote activities such as information dissemination, public relations, special events, related tourism programs and more...
  ...importantly how to market the Philippines as a major MICE destination.
  4. He plans to hire competent people who are knowledgeable, that is why he needs to go to this office or agency that develops training...
  ...modules and conduct multi skills training seminars, including continuing education programs for the industry manpower.
  5. One of the equipment that he will need is a vehicle. He has to secure a license and certificate to operate from an agency...
  ...that governs all land transport vehicles. He agreed to visit this agency that governs all land transport vehicles. He agreed to visit this agency...

  6. Mr. Mercado is aware that one of the functions of travel agencies is to provide assistance in securing travel documents...
  ...like passports, visas and tickets. For issuance of passports, his company needs to deal with this department that issues passports.
  7-8. For air tickets, however, he is aware that his company must sell tickets of airlines that are officially adhering to the standards...
  ...for air carriers. These carriers must be licensed by these two agencies who work in partnership with DOTC.

</p><p>
</p><p>We are being left behind.  </p><p>
</p><p>Our future is not so bright
</p><p>
</p>To date, only 4 countries in the world still have not reopened schools since the pandemic began in March 2020. By the end of September, there will only be two — Philippines and Venezuela.  Bangladesh and Kuwait will reopen on September 12 and September 27, respectively.
<p>
</p><p>The pandemic exposed our societal institutions’ weakness. Our Healthcare is dysfunctional and our Education is malfunctioning. As usual, only the moneyed can leap a larger step than those who have next to nothing. Since September 2020, the school launched a blended learning such as module and online classes. Admittedly, we have not been successful and they are also causing students’ lives. There were so many suggestions so far like using a radio for far-flung areas as means to educate all students.  </p><p>But we demand better than this.  </p><p>We need better access to learning like ample internet speed, gadgets for learning, and academic breaks. Let everyone face the new normal in education fairly.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/21978879</p><br />
