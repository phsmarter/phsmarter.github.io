                                            Unit 1. SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane? Explain your answer.________________________WORKSHEET NO.2DIRECTIONS: Classify whether the following professions/occupations are related to physical er biologicalscience.1. Doctor2. Engineer3.

                            1. Discuss the Nature OF science, Technology ang society (essay)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> How Science and Technology Are 
</p><p>for Society 
</p><p>Section 1.1 explained that the key to future 
</p><p>progress for mankind lies in the realization of 
</p><p>“science and technology for society, and in 
</p><p>society.” In Section 1.2, the current state of science 
</p><p>and technology, and the issues confronting it, are 
</p><p>examined from the viewpoint of “science and 
</p><p>technology for society.” 
</p><p>1.2.1 Contributing to Society through 
</p><p>Knowledge Creation and Utilization 
</p><p>Scientific and technological activities refers to 
</p><p>the elucidation of unknown phenomena, and to the 
</p><p>creation of new knowledge through the discovery of 
</p><p>new natural laws and principles, and the new 
</p><p>knowledge obtained is then utilized in the real 
</p><p>society. The essence of how science and technology 
</p><p>contributes to society is the creation of new 
</p><p>knowledge, and then utilization of that knowledge 
</p><p>to boost the prosperity of human lives, and to solve 
</p><p>the various issues facing society. 
</p><p>With the shift to a knowledge-based society well 
</p><p>underway in the opening years of the 21st century, 
</p><p>the creation of new knowledge is an increasingly 
</p><p>important aspect of scientific and technological 
</p><p>activities, and the role of science in this knowledge 
</p><p>creation is important for the realization of “science 
</p><p>and technology for society.” 
</p><p>The relationship between science and technology 
</p><p>and society, can be described by the example of 
</p><p>rain falling on a mountain. Rain that has fallen on a 
</p><p>mountain does not immediately wash away 
</p><p>downhill. First, it is captured and stored by forests, 
</p><p>giving life to trees and other vegetation and creating 
</p><p>a verdant landscape. This can be compared to the 
</p><p>accumulation of scientific knowledge and the 
</p><p>continuing search for truth, obtained through basic 
</p><p>research, and perhaps demonstrates that science has 
</p><p>intrinsic value in itself. Meanwhile, the rainwater 
</p><p>stored in the forest bubbles out from springs and 
</p><p>flows downhill in a steadily widening stream. A 
</p><p>single stream flow can separate into a large number 
</p><p>of sub-flows, and sometimes the flow can go 
</p><p>underground into a subterranean network. This 
</p><p>situation can be compared to the diversity of 
</p><p>research and development that can arise based on 
</p><p>scientific knowledge, leading to the planting of 
</p><p>various new technological seeds. Eventually, the 
</p><p>river reaches farming communities and urban cities, 
</p><p>where it is utilized for drinking water and other 
</p><p>household purposes, for agricultural or industrial 
</p><p>uses, and for various other needs, universally 
</p><p>benefiting all aspects of society. This is equivalent 
</p><p>to research and development resulting in practical 
</p><p>technologies that boost the prosperity of the 
</p><p>people’s society and lives, and to the utilization of 
</p><p>science and technology in response to various 
</p><p>issues facing society. If the forest fails to capture a 
</p><p>sufficient amount of the falling rain, society will 
</p><p>quickly be faced with drought and people will not 
</p><p>be able to live. In the same way, realization of 
</p><p>societal progress through science and technology 
</p><p>requires a sufficient accumulation of scientific 
</p><p>knowledge. In other words, science can be 
</p><p>considered to be the foundation strength of society. 
</p><p>However, this foundation strength is not something 
</p><p>that can be acquired in a single day or night, but 
</p><p>instead requires a steady, continuous build-up</p><br />

                            2. how the advance of technology helps and destroy the natural environment in 3 paragraph essay</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The advances in technology have helped in many ways to protect the natural environment. For example, the use of clean energy technologies such as wind and solar power has reduced the reliance on fossil fuels, which has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, advances in recycling technology have made it easier to recycle materials and reduce waste. Technology has also enabled the development of more efficient transportation, such as electric cars and high-speed trains, which reduce the carbon footprint of travel.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, technology has also contributed to the destruction of the natural environment. Industrialization and urbanization have led to the destruction of natural habitats and the loss of biodiversity. The production and disposal of electronic devices, such as smartphones and computers, contribute to the accumulation of e-waste, which can contaminate soil and water. Moreover, the extraction of natural resources, such as oil and minerals, has led to environmental degradation, including soil erosion, water pollution, and deforestation.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the advances in technology have both helped and destroyed the natural environment. While technology has provided solutions to many environmental problems, it has also contributed to the destruction of the natural world. It is important to recognize the environmental impact of technology and work to minimize its negative effects while maximizing its positive benefits.</p><br />
