                        <p><strong>Answer/Explanation:</strong></p><p>The problem of alcohol use is very relevant nowadays. Today alcohol consumption characterized by vast numbers in the world. All of society is suffering from this, but primarily jeopardized the younger generation: children, teenagers, young people, and the health of future mothers. Because alcohol is particularly active effect on the body that are not formed, gradually destroying it. The harm of alcohol abuse is evident. It is proved that when alcohol is ingested inside the body, it is carried by blood to all organs and has harmful effect on them until destruction. Systematic use of alcohol develops a dangerous disease such as alcoholism. Alcoholism is dangerous to human health, but it is curable as other diseases.  The big problem is that most of the alcohol products which are made in private places contain many toxic substances, defective products often leads to poisoning and even death. All this has negative impact on society and its cultural values.</p><p></p><p>This article was produced by the Institute of <strong>Alcohol Studies in July 2007.</strong> In this article researches used scientific method to find relationship between alcohol problems and mental health, how frequent is overlap between mental health and problem drinking, conditions which associated with alcohol abuse and dependence, reasons why people consume alcohol and connection between alcohol drinking and other drugs.</p><p></p><p>According to Institute of Alcohol Studies there is more than one kind of relationship involved between alcohol problems and mental health, such as: mental health problems may be a cause of problem drinking and vice versa; there may be a factor in common, in the genes or in the early family environment, which later contributes to both a mental health problems and alcohol problem.</p><p></p><p>cancer, liver and pancreas disease etc. There are many factors why do people drink, such as: make friends, forget problems, to feel happy, to relax, to feel less anxious, to feel confident and the genes, in my opinion play the key role in this problem. Some people don’t realize that this is a big deal, the big problem until it’s late. Once someone tried alcohol and become dependent it is hard to realize that person needs help to stop it. Also drinking alcohol is closely linked with use of other drugs, legal and illegal. Smoking, drinking and drug taking often co-exist. I chose this article to review because I think it has good examples to show people what causes alcohol dependence and what conditions one can get if drinking alcohol often. People need to remember that we live ones and it is important to keep ourselves healthy and none of bad habits worth our life.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Alcohol and Drug Abuse</p><p>Use and abuse of drugs and alcohol by teens is very common and can have serious consequences. In the 15-24 year age range, 50% of deaths (from accidents, homicides, suicides) involve alcohol or drug abuse. Drugs and alcohol also contribute to physical and sexual aggression such as assault or rape. Possible stages of teenage experience with alcohol and drugs include abstinence (non-use), experimentation, regular use (both recreational and compensatory for other problems), abuse, and dependency. Repeated and regular recreational use can lead to other problems like anxiety and depression. Some teenagers regularly use drugs or alcohol to compensate for anxiety, depression, or a lack of positive social skills. Teen use of tobacco and alcohol should not be minimized because they can be "gateway drugs" for other drugs (marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, and heroin). The combination of teenagers' curiosity, risk taking behavior, and social pressure make it very difficult to say no. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Having an alcoholic father could be a nightmare to many. You face it day by day. What's hard about it, is the fact that you can't seem to stop him, for it already became an addiction. Being drunk here and there, day in and day out, troubles, fights, and it's even harder for it seems to get worse everyday. </p><p></p><p>It was really hard to face it day by day, but I choose to make it as an inspiration, a motivation. It made me learn to stand not just for myself but for my  mother, brothers and sisters. It made me work harder everyday. Seeing my father being drunk makes me wanna be a better person someday, better than he does. An alcoholic father made me a stronger person today, than I am before. It made me strong enough to pass through all the problems and hindrances that may come to my way.</p><p></p><p>A problem doesn't only bring negative effects, it could bring positive ones. It's just a matter of how you see it. It's your choice to make it as something that holds you back from achieving your goals, or to see it as something that makes you grow as a person.</p><p></p><p>**hope it helps**</p><br />

                            11. ESSAY what is the role of the gin/alcohol in the curing process to curing process of fish fillet?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>Fish fillets have been around for thousands of years and are one of the most basic and desirable dishes. In their current fresh form, these delicacies must be cured. This process is generally done by applying a chemical mixture to the fish outside as well as inside, which includes soaking it in salt water or alcohol. But what role does alcohol play? Is it a necessary component in the curing process?</p><p></p><p>First of all, you can think about fish fillets as a type of food that has been processed via drying rather than cooking. This means that they have been dried and then frozen, which basically means that the ingredients are cooled.</p><p></p><p>Salting has been used for hundreds of years in curing fish and meat, but it was only discovered by the ancient Romans. The fish were left to dry out in shallow pits covered with salt for a few days and then moved to deeper pits with a specific mix of salt, sulfur and ferrous chloride (FeCl3). The result is the browning of the outside and it can be preserved for a long time by salt curing.</p><p></p><p>But why does salt curing work? Actually, we cannot use the word “salt” for any salt substance of sodium chloride, and in general, there are two ways to explain the process. The first explanation is that it is closely related to the amount of water inside the meat. Salt attracts and absorbs water from the meat through osmosis, and at the same time, sodium (Na+) ions from salt react with the organic material in meat to make them more solid.</p><p></p><p>So basically, the role of the gin/alcohol in the curing process of fish fillet is to decrease the amount of water in the meat.</p><p></p><p>But is the alcohol really necessary? As it turns out, this question is not simple to answer. In general, meat products can be cured by a number of methods including salting and smoking. The last method is used as a technological process that involves heating the product in an oven at high temperature and then cooling it down quickly before storing it to preserve the food.</p><br />

For young people, it is difficult to ignore this peer pressure otherwise they will feel neglected and isolated in the group. To prevent such happenings, they get into forming a habit of consuming drugs.</p><p></p><p>Existing mental condition</p><p>Another major reason to try drugs is the present mental health of a person. People who are weaker on emotional levels have the tendency to feel depressed. They search for means that sets them free and live life as per their choice. In that situation, they begin consuming drugs and slowly it becomes an addiction.</p><p></p><p>Psychological Trauma</p><p>A lot of drug addicts holds psychological trauma as the cause behind substance abuse. Around 75% of people who suffers from psychological shock, uses drugs to get cured. It is perceived as a self-medicating strategy to deal with their self-destructive behavior.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Because they think , it will help them to solve every problem.</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>People choose a particular drug mainly for the specific feelings they get from using it. For example, people may use codeine to relieve pain or drink alcohol to relax and relieve stress. Some people take amphetamines to increase energy or use hallucinogens to alter their perception.5</p><p></p><p>Using one drug doesn’t necessarily lead people to trying other drugs. Research dismisses concerns about so-called 'gateway drugs'.</p><p></p><p>There is no evidence suggesting people who use cannabis will ‘graduate’ over time to other drugs such as heroin or amphetamines.6</p><p></p><p>A person's AOD use may be influenced by the availability, price and purity of specific drugs. It’s often a combination of factors that determine which drug a person uses. Usually if supplies of a preferred drug fall (which in turn can significantly increase the price) then people may switch to an alternative drug to satisfy their needs.</p><p></p><br />

It helps me to relax and unwind after a long day, and it can also be used to celebrate special occasions. Alcohol can also be used to enhance the flavor of food, and it can be used to create unique cocktails for parties or other social gatherings. I enjoy trying different types of alcohol, from craft beers to fine wines, and I often experiment with different recipes for mixed drinks.</p><p></p><p>The pencil is another important item in my life. I use it for writing notes, drawing pictures, and completing tasks at work or school. Pencils are also great for sketching out ideas or creating art projects. I always keep a few pencils handy so that I can jot down ideas when they come to me.</p><p></p><p>Ballpoint pens are also essential items in my life. They are great for taking notes during meetings or lectures, and they are also useful for signing documents or filling out forms. Ballpoint pens come in a variety of colors and styles, so I can choose one that suits my needs.</p><p></p><p>Paper is another important item in my life. I use paper for writing letters, printing documents, making lists, and creating artwork. Paper comes in many different sizes and textures, so I can find the perfect type for any project that I am working on.</p><p></p><p>Plastic envelopes are also essential items in my life. They are great for organizing documents or storing important items such as photographs or letters. Plastic envelopes come in a variety of sizes and colors, so I can find the perfect one for any task that I need to complete.</p><p></p><p>These five items – alcohol, pencils, ballpoint pens, paper, and plastic envelopes – are all essential items in my life that help me stay organized and productive throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Brainliest and thanks would be greatly appreciated :D</p><p></p><p></p><br />
