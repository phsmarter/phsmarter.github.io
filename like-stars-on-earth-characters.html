                                            Read: A selection from Genesis 1:26-31
Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”
 So God created humankind in his image,
 in the image of God he created them;
 male and female he created them.
Read the full passage.
Listen:
Did you know that when God made humans, he made us to look like him? God made all the stars and planets, all the beluga whales and blue jays, all the buffalo and begonias—but God didn’t make any of those things in his image.
It was only when he made humans that he said, “Let’s make them like us.”
It’s true! Something about you is made to look just like God.
Is it your eyes? When you smile, do they crinkle at the corners, just like God’s do? Is it your hair? Does God have a cowlick in just the same place you do? Maybe it’s your laugh. When something is so silly you can hardly breathe, do you sound like God sounds?
It’s hard to know exactly what God looks and sounds like—except that we know what Jesus is like. Jesus is God in the form of a human being. Jesus looks exactly like God. He is God!
So if you’re wondering what about you resembles God, you can just think about Jesus. You might not have his hair color, and your body might be built differently than his, but your heart can look just like Jesus’s heart.
Wonder:
What things about you—your personality or your character—are like Jesus? Can you think of ways that God made you to look like him?</a>

                                            Rich People Problems
an excerpt by Kevin Kwan
1 Bettina Ortiz y Meña was not accustomed to waiting. A former Miss
Venezuela and Miss Universe runner-up, of course, the exceedingly bronzed
strawberry blond was these days the wife of Miami auto-parts tycoon, Herman Ortiz
y Meña, and at every restaurant she chose to grace with her presence, she was
always greeted with reverence and whisked to the exact table she desired. Today she
wanted the corner table on the terrace at Sip Sip, her favorite lunch spot on Harbor
Island.
She wanted to sit on one of the comfy orange canvas director's chairs and
stare out at the gently lapping turquoise waters while eating her Kale Caesar salad,
but there was a large noisy group taking up the entire terrace and they didn't seem
in4nuch hurry to leave.
2 Bettina fumed as she glared at the tourists happily savoring their lunch in
the sun. Look how tacky they were...the woman overly tanned, wrinkled, and saggy,
none of them properly lifted or botoxed.
She felt like walking up to their table and handing out her dermatologist's
business cards. And the men were even worse. All dressed in all rumpled shirts and
shorts, wearing those cheap straw hats sold at the trinket shot on Dunmore Street.
Why did such people have to come here?
3 The three-and-a-half-mile-long paradise with its pristine pink-sand
beaches was one of the best-kept secrets in the Caribbean, a haven for the very rich
filled with quaint little wood houses painted in shades of sherbet, charmin
boutiques, chic oceanfront mansions turned into inns, and five-star restaurants to
rival St. Barths. Tourists should have to take a style exam before being allowed to
set foot on the Island! Feeling that she had been patient long enough, Bettina
stormed into the kitchen, the fringe on her crocheted Pucci caftan top shaking
furiously as she made a beeline for the woman with a shock of pixie-cut blond hair
manning the main stove.
4 "Julie, honey, what's the dealio? I've waited more than fifteen minute
my table!" Bettina sighed to the owner of the restaurant.
"Sorry, Bettina, it's been one of those days. The party of twelve on the ter
lowed up first just before you did," Julie replied as she handed off a bowl of spicy
conch chili to waiting server.
"But the terrace is your prime spot! Why on earth did you let those tourists
take up all that space?"
5 "Well, that tourist in the red fishing cap is the Duke of Glencora. His party
just boated over from Windermere - that's his Royal Huisman you see moored off
the coast. Isn't it the most handsome sailboat you've ever seen?"
6 "I'm not impressed by big boats," Bettina huffed, although secretly she wasThey even searched my walk-in freezer. See that Chinese fellow seated at the
end of the table?"
Bettina squinted through her Dior Extase sunglasses at the portly, balding,
seventy-something Asian man dressed in a nondescript white short-sleeved golf
shirt and gray trousers. "Oh, I didn't even notice him! Am I supposed to know who
he is?"
That's Alfred Shang, Julie said in a hushed tone.
&gt; Bettina giggled. "He looks like their chauffeur. Doesn't he look like that guy
that used to drive Jane Wyman around in Falcon Crest?"
Julie, who was trying to focus on searing a cut of tuna to perfection, shook her head
a tight-lipped smile. "From what I hear, that chauffeur is the most powerful man in
Asia."
"What's his name again?"

                            4. Read: A selection from Genesis 1:26-31
Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”
 So God created humankind in his image,
 in the image of God he created them;
 male and female he created them.
Read the full passage.
Listen:
Did you know that when God made humans, he made us to look like him? God made all the stars and planets, all the beluga whales and blue jays, all the buffalo and begonias—but God didn’t make any of those things in his image.
It was only when he made humans that he said, “Let’s make them like us.”
It’s true! Something about you is made to look just like God.
Is it your eyes? When you smile, do they crinkle at the corners, just like God’s do? Is it your hair? Does God have a cowlick in just the same place you do? Maybe it’s your laugh. When something is so silly you can hardly breathe, do you sound like God sounds?
It’s hard to know exactly what God looks and sounds like—except that we know what Jesus is like. Jesus is God in the form of a human being. Jesus looks exactly like God. He is God!
So if you’re wondering what about you resembles God, you can just think about Jesus. You might not have his hair color, and your body might be built differently than his, but your heart can look just like Jesus’s heart.
Wonder:
What things about you—your personality or your character—are like Jesus? Can you think of ways that God made you to look like him?</h2><br />

                            6. Rich People Problems
an excerpt by Kevin Kwan
1 Bettina Ortiz y Meña was not accustomed to waiting. A former Miss
Venezuela and Miss Universe runner-up, of course, the exceedingly bronzed
strawberry blond was these days the wife of Miami auto-parts tycoon, Herman Ortiz
y Meña, and at every restaurant she chose to grace with her presence, she was
always greeted with reverence and whisked to the exact table she desired. Today she
wanted the corner table on the terrace at Sip Sip, her favorite lunch spot on Harbor
Island.
She wanted to sit on one of the comfy orange canvas director's chairs and
stare out at the gently lapping turquoise waters while eating her Kale Caesar salad,
but there was a large noisy group taking up the entire terrace and they didn't seem
in4nuch hurry to leave.
2 Bettina fumed as she glared at the tourists happily savoring their lunch in
the sun. Look how tacky they were...the woman overly tanned, wrinkled, and saggy,
none of them properly lifted or botoxed.
She felt like walking up to their table and handing out her dermatologist's
business cards. And the men were even worse. All dressed in all rumpled shirts and
shorts, wearing those cheap straw hats sold at the trinket shot on Dunmore Street.
Why did such people have to come here?
3 The three-and-a-half-mile-long paradise with its pristine pink-sand
beaches was one of the best-kept secrets in the Caribbean, a haven for the very rich
filled with quaint little wood houses painted in shades of sherbet, charmin
boutiques, chic oceanfront mansions turned into inns, and five-star restaurants to
rival St. Barths. Tourists should have to take a style exam before being allowed to
set foot on the Island! Feeling that she had been patient long enough, Bettina
stormed into the kitchen, the fringe on her crocheted Pucci caftan top shaking
furiously as she made a beeline for the woman with a shock of pixie-cut blond hair
manning the main stove.
4 "Julie, honey, what's the dealio? I've waited more than fifteen minute
my table!" Bettina sighed to the owner of the restaurant.
"Sorry, Bettina, it's been one of those days. The party of twelve on the ter
lowed up first just before you did," Julie replied as she handed off a bowl of spicy
conch chili to waiting server.
"But the terrace is your prime spot! Why on earth did you let those tourists
take up all that space?"
5 "Well, that tourist in the red fishing cap is the Duke of Glencora. His party
just boated over from Windermere - that's his Royal Huisman you see moored off
the coast. Isn't it the most handsome sailboat you've ever seen?"
6 "I'm not impressed by big boats," Bettina huffed, although secretly she wasThey even searched my walk-in freezer. See that Chinese fellow seated at the
end of the table?"
Bettina squinted through her Dior Extase sunglasses at the portly, balding,
seventy-something Asian man dressed in a nondescript white short-sleeved golf
shirt and gray trousers. "Oh, I didn't even notice him! Am I supposed to know who
he is?"
That's Alfred Shang, Julie said in a hushed tone.
&gt; Bettina giggled. "He looks like their chauffeur. Doesn't he look like that guy
that used to drive Jane Wyman around in Falcon Crest?"
Julie, who was trying to focus on searing a cut of tuna to perfection, shook her head
a tight-lipped smile. "From what I hear, that chauffeur is the most powerful man in
Asia."
"What's his name again?"
