                                            College students are often considered a bellwether of Internet use, but the Internet is not the only technology they have incorporated into everyday life. Thanks to a plethora of technologies (video game consoles, computers, handheld devices, Internet) a range of entertainment options is at their disposal, a range that is much wider than was available to their predecessors. Furthermore, today’s college students are using technologies like cell phones, mp3 players and other devices to entertain themselves wherever they may be. The goal of this study was to learn about college students’ use of video, computer and online games, and to determine the impact of that use on their everyday life. To meet those goals the researchers used three approaches. First, surveys were randomly distributed to college students at a wide range of two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities in the continental United States. Students from 27 colleges and universities participated and the surveys were collected between March 2002 and June 2002, and September 2002 and October 2002. This sample was intended to produce results that would correspond to the demographics for all U.S. college students as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual almanac issue.10 The sample was tested against known population parameters (gender, race, age) and found to be reflective of the national population of college students. In all, 1,162 surveys were returned. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points. This study focused on traditional college students, ones who are seeking a college degree and who devote much or all of their time to their studies. Second, a team of graduate student researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was recruited to observe the behaviors of college students at 10 Chicago area institutions of higher education. The researchers were trained in ethnographic methods of observation and data collecting, and rotated the times of the day and days of the week they spent in various public settings where college students could be found using computers and the Internet. Third, additional material was based on a previous study of college students’ Internet use conducted by this research team for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project11 and on the findings of surveys of Americans about their use of the Internet conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 2001 and 2002 for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.1.

                                            On academic performance The academic performance of a student who was addicted to gaming suffered. Since the student is too engrossed in the game to finish their assignments or prepare for class, they found that gaming addiction has a negative physical impact on academic performance. Others have shown a connection between playing online games and performing worse in school. Even if the respondents play online games, their academic performance is unaffected. Even though they spent time playing, they nevertheless received good grades. Overall, the respondents’ academic performance is strong despite their interest in playing online games, according to the study’s findings. This can be seen as the compromise made when playing video games. There won’t be any points deducted from the student’s grade if they elect not to participate (Dennis O. Dumrique and Jennifer G. Castillo, 2018). According to university of Syracuse reported that being addicted to games may lead to decrease sleep, inference with the demands of society life including socializing and academic work. These online games have a big factor that affects the students in their academic performances in school. According much attention has been directed to the use of online games for learning in the recent years, in part due to the straggering amounts of capital spent on games in the entertainment industry, but also because of their ability to captivate player attention and hold it for lengthy periods of time as players learn to master game complexities and accomplish objectives. pahanap Po ng reference ​please </a>

                            4. College students are often considered a bellwether of Internet use, but the Internet is not the only technology they have incorporated into everyday life. Thanks to a plethora of technologies (video game consoles, computers, handheld devices, Internet) a range of entertainment options is at their disposal, a range that is much wider than was available to their predecessors. Furthermore, today’s college students are using technologies like cell phones, mp3 players and other devices to entertain themselves wherever they may be. The goal of this study was to learn about college students’ use of video, computer and online games, and to determine the impact of that use on their everyday life. To meet those goals the researchers used three approaches. First, surveys were randomly distributed to college students at a wide range of two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities in the continental United States. Students from 27 colleges and universities participated and the surveys were collected between March 2002 and June 2002, and September 2002 and October 2002. This sample was intended to produce results that would correspond to the demographics for all U.S. college students as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual almanac issue.10 The sample was tested against known population parameters (gender, race, age) and found to be reflective of the national population of college students. In all, 1,162 surveys were returned. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points. This study focused on traditional college students, ones who are seeking a college degree and who devote much or all of their time to their studies. Second, a team of graduate student researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was recruited to observe the behaviors of college students at 10 Chicago area institutions of higher education. The researchers were trained in ethnographic methods of observation and data collecting, and rotated the times of the day and days of the week they spent in various public settings where college students could be found using computers and the Internet. Third, additional material was based on a previous study of college students’ Internet use conducted by this research team for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project11 and on the findings of surveys of Americans about their use of the Internet conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 2001 and 2002 for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The possible participants that may be impacted by online gaming towards students' effective time management are:</p><p></p><p>1. Students - Online gaming can affect the students' effective time management since they may spend more time playing games rather than doing their academic requirements or other necessary activities.</p><p></p><p>2. Parents - Parents may also be affected since they may notice that their children are spending too much time playing online games instead of studying or doing other productive activities.</p><p></p><p>3. Teachers - Teachers may also be impacted since they may observe that their students are not submitting their assignments on time, or their performance in school is declining because of excessive online gaming.</p><p></p><p>4. School Administrators - School administrators may also be affected since they are responsible for ensuring that their students are meeting academic requirements and are developing good study habits.</p><p></p><p>The impact of online gaming on students' effective time management can be significant since it can lead to poor academic performance, lack of sleep, and other negative outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to address this issue by promoting responsible gaming habits and creating awareness among students, parents, teachers, and school administrators on the importance of effective time management. Encouraging a healthy balance between online gaming and other necessary activities such as studying, exercise, and socializing can also help students develop good time management skills.</p><br />

                            13. On academic performance The academic performance of a student who was addicted to gaming suffered. Since the student is too engrossed in the game to finish their assignments or prepare for class, they found that gaming addiction has a negative physical impact on academic performance. Others have shown a connection between playing online games and performing worse in school. Even if the respondents play online games, their academic performance is unaffected. Even though they spent time playing, they nevertheless received good grades. Overall, the respondents’ academic performance is strong despite their interest in playing online games, according to the study’s findings. This can be seen as the compromise made when playing video games. There won’t be any points deducted from the student’s grade if they elect not to participate (Dennis O. Dumrique and Jennifer G. Castillo, 2018). According to university of Syracuse reported that being addicted to games may lead to decrease sleep, inference with the demands of society life including socializing and academic work. These online games have a big factor that affects the students in their academic performances in school. According much attention has been directed to the use of online games for learning in the recent years, in part due to the straggering amounts of capital spent on games in the entertainment industry, but also because of their ability to captivate player attention and hold it for lengthy periods of time as players learn to master game complexities and accomplish objectives. pahanap Po ng reference ​please </h2><br />
