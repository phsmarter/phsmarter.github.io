Should Mobile Phones be Banned in Schools?
In the last few years there has been an explosion in the use of new
communications technologies, including mobile phones; it is estimated that over
70% of young people aged 10–14 now own one. Considerable debate has taken
place in the press recently as to whether pupils should be allowed to take their
mobile phones into school.
No one can deny the positive benefits of children communicating freely
with each other, and pupils argue that using a mobile phone to talk to or text
message their friends is simply one way of doing this, using new technology. Many
parents are in favor too, and like the reassurance of knowing their child can be
safer and more independent if they have a mobile phone, since they can contact
them at any time if necessary. They cite the potential risks faced by some children
travelling alone.
However, schools point out that carrying a mobile phone could in itself
make a child more vulnerable to theft or mugging, both on the street and even in
the playground. Police figures confirm that a high proportion of crimes committed
against young people involve thefts of mobile phones. Schools are concerned,
moreover, that allowing pupils to bring their mobiles to school could create a
competitive atmosphere amongst children and result in some children feeling left
out and unvalued. In addition, they claim that pupils’ education would be affected
by the distraction of phones ringing in class. Some doctors fear that children using mobiles could suffer long-term brain
damage. Until this is disproved, it would seem that schools might best protect
their pupils from this and other problems by making them leave their mobile
phones at home.</a>

                        I don't think so... But use it for emergency. No. Strict rules will do (I think). Some bring mobile phone for emergency, some for boredom, some for doing a research. I don't think that it should be banned, the students need only to be discipline and responsible enough.<br />

Should Mobile Phones be Banned in Schools?
In the last few years there has been an explosion in the use of new
communications technologies, including mobile phones; it is estimated that over
70% of young people aged 10–14 now own one. Considerable debate has taken
place in the press recently as to whether pupils should be allowed to take their
mobile phones into school.
No one can deny the positive benefits of children communicating freely
with each other, and pupils argue that using a mobile phone to talk to or text
message their friends is simply one way of doing this, using new technology. Many
parents are in favor too, and like the reassurance of knowing their child can be
safer and more independent if they have a mobile phone, since they can contact
them at any time if necessary. They cite the potential risks faced by some children
travelling alone.
However, schools point out that carrying a mobile phone could in itself
make a child more vulnerable to theft or mugging, both on the street and even in
the playground. Police figures confirm that a high proportion of crimes committed
against young people involve thefts of mobile phones. Schools are concerned,
moreover, that allowing pupils to bring their mobiles to school could create a
competitive atmosphere amongst children and result in some children feeling left
out and unvalued. In addition, they claim that pupils’ education would be affected
by the distraction of phones ringing in class. Some doctors fear that children using mobiles could suffer long-term brain
damage. Until this is disproved, it would seem that schools might best protect
their pupils from this and other problems by making them leave their mobile
phones at home.</h2><br />

                        Phones should not be banned in school because they serve as a mode of communication between the parent and their child. In our school, we have to surrender our phones during class hours and we can only get them with teacher authorization or during dismissal. This helps the students to avoid getting distracted during class and at the same time, give them the chance to talk to their parents after school hours when they have after-school extracurricular activities. Banning phones in school will not only cause the students to rebel but also add an obstacle in the parent to student communication. <br />

                        It depends because some students are using cellphone for their studies while others use it for playing games, social media, and such. But for me, they should not ban or prohibit students in using their phones because others will be affected if the school will do this. It is because sometimes, some of their teachers requires them to use their phones for researching purposes because there are some lessons that needs to be searched in order for students to understand it more clearly. Instead, i suggest that rather than doing this, it is more better if the school will implement the project called <strong>'Collecting Phones Only During Classes'</strong>. It is where their subject teachers will be required to collect the phones of the students during class and will bring it back after the class, during their spare time, or if they need it during class. And if there are someone calling on the student's phone, the teachers who had collected the phone should be the one to answer it. In that way, i think that there will be no students affected because they can still use their phones during their leisure time and also they can still focus on studies because there are no phones who will distract them during class time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Paki-bilang nalang kasi i think 200+ sya.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes because cellphones helps communication go on. Well, we have to thoroughly see what it is meant by not allowing. If not allow mean no cell phone at all within school circumstance, i would like to say big no.</p><p></p><p>As it is stated “mobile Phone”, students will bring it wherever they are such as, in the toilet, library, café, or even class. It grows the mobility and flexibility between parents and their children.</p><p></p><p>Why mobility and flexibility are so important?</p><p></p><p>In case their parents are sick, or someone important for them is dead, or most cases, the students needs their parents help to bring something important that they forget, mobile phone is the first help to access, unless there is no even an account in their cell phone.</p><p></p><p>Even if there may be a phone center in any school, yet it is still not as flexible as mobile phone. If the case is about class disturbance, it does not mean that we have to completely ban them. we can just simply establish a helpful school policy. For example, during the class the teacher shall ask student to put their cell phone in front of the class, or near the teacher.</p><p></p><p>Then, student will have no chance to make use it wrongly that may disturb the class session. So overall, cell phone helps student to shorten the range between their parents. Parents can still control them. Parents still have their capability to inform anything important.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Many students in schools frequently sneak around with their own cell phones, attempting to disguise them from teachers or administrators. Initially, cell phones were prohibited in schools. To be honest, it makes a lot of sense for students to be prohibited from using their cell phones during school hours. Cell phones should be banned in schools because they distract students, enable cheating, and are potentially dangerous. Cell phones are a source of distraction for students in the classroom. When students text in class, it draws attention away from other students, making it difficult for them to learn. Also, if it goes off in class, the teacher may stop teaching and concentrate everyone's attention on that cell phone.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
