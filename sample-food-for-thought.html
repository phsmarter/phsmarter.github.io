                                            A campaign can be seen as an organized, purposely effort to create change, and it should be guided by thoughtful planning.Here is a sample body of a Project Proposal written by a student and presented to the school administration for action. If you want it to be a good written proposal, rewrite it to suite the standards of a good proposal.Project Proposal:Our school is located in the residential vicinity. Hence, it is far from the commercial center where food stalls and restaurants are easily accessible. Besides, the students in our school are not allowed to leave the premises at lunch time.I observe that food served in our canteen are not balanced and most of them are no longer served hot. I suggest that the school canteen serve hot food all time at a reasonable price and that it offers variety of food choices.Definitely, when this project becomes a reality, the student costumers will ne happy and the sales of the canteen will increase. This will be beneficial to all.​</a>

                                            Sample Reading Text: When we survey our lives and efforts we soon observe that almost the whole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings. We notice that whole nature resembles social animals. We eat food that others have produced, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been passed on to us by other people though the medium of a language which others have created. Without language and mental capacities, we would have been poor indeed comparable to higher animals. We have therefore to admit that we owe our principal knowledge over the least to the fact of living in human society. The individual if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly imagine.

Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</a>

                                            Procedure: Read and analyze the scenario that follows, then answer the questions. More than a century ago, the inhabitants in the Dutch East Indies were attacked by a strange nerve disease now identifies as beriberi. Infected persons lost their appetite, developed inflammation of the nerves, and became paralyzed. The most common manifestation of thiamine deficiency is beri-beri, which is characterized by a peripheral sensorimotor axonal neuropathy with numbness, paresthesias, or burning pain, occasionally accompanied by peripheral edema from heart failure ("wet beri-beri"). Other causes of thiamine deficiency include reliance on foods in which the vitamin has been inactivated by processing (eg, polished rice), overcooking, or eating foods that contain thiaminase-producing bacteria (eg, raw fish). Deficiency also contributes to the neuropathy of chemotherapy. Thiamine deficiency has been reported to cause the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Scientists who first studied the outbreak thought that the disease might be caused by bacteria. To discover answers to their questions and to properly understand the disease, the scientists obtained blood samples from beriben patients fell ill. Surprisingly, even the control group suffered from the illness. Dr. Christian Eijkman, a member of the group of scientists working on the disease, observes that before the experiment, all the chickens were fed with polished rice. Dr Eikman later found out that whole-grain rice contains high amounts of vitamin B1 or thiamine, a vitamin necessary for good health, which enable the body to use carbohydrates as energy. It plays a key role in nerve, muscle, and heart functions. Thiamine is absent is polished rice.POST-LABORATORY QUESTION1. WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM? 2. WHAT WAS THE HYPOTHESIS? 3. HOW WAS THE HYPOTHESIS TESTED? 4. BASE ON THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT, SHOULD BE THE HYPOTHESIS BE ACCEPTED OR REJECTED? SUPPORT YOUR ANSWER5. HOW COULD THIS EXPERIMENT BE APPROVED?​​</a>

                            8. Sample Reading Text: When we survey our lives and efforts we soon observe that almost the whole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings. We notice that whole nature resembles social animals. We eat food that others have produced, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been passed on to us by other people though the medium of a language which others have created. Without language and mental capacities, we would have been poor indeed comparable to higher animals. We have therefore to admit that we owe our principal knowledge over the least to the fact of living in human society. The individual if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly imagine. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he ha not much in virtue of the individuality, but rather as a member of a great hum community, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle grave.Here are the questions:1:what is the message of the text?2: what are the things that you understand form the text?3: what do you think are the important points to be remembered in the text?4: what is the message of the text?kinda need na Yung answer(nonsense answer report) hehe​</h2><br />

Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarm
</p><p>
</p><p>clock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t want
</p><p>
</p><p>to wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t say
</p><p>
</p><p>no to an all-day babysitting job.
</p><p>
</p><p>When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison was
</p><p>
</p><p>watching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. The
</p><p>
</p><p>kids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfast
</p><p>
</p><p>together.
</p><p>
</p><p>We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smiths
</p><p>
</p><p>only live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of fun
</p><p>
</p><p>watching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,
</p><p>
</p><p>but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.
</p><p>
</p><p>When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breeze
</p><p>
</p><p>to make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I had
</p><p>
</p><p>to do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.
</p><p>
</p><p>After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disney
</p><p>
</p><p>movie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom to
</p><p>
</p><p>pick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stop
</p><p>
</p><p>laughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that the
</p><p>
</p><p>theatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!
</p><p>
</p><p>My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. We
</p><p>
</p><p>had only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect her
</p><p>
</p><p>home so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.
</p><p>
</p><p>It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called to
</p><p>

                            11. Procedure: Read and analyze the scenario that follows, then answer the questions. More than a century ago, the inhabitants in the Dutch East Indies were attacked by a strange nerve disease now identifies as beriberi. Infected persons lost their appetite, developed inflammation of the nerves, and became paralyzed. The most common manifestation of thiamine deficiency is beri-beri, which is characterized by a peripheral sensorimotor axonal neuropathy with numbness, paresthesias, or burning pain, occasionally accompanied by peripheral edema from heart failure ("wet beri-beri"). Other causes of thiamine deficiency include reliance on foods in which the vitamin has been inactivated by processing (eg, polished rice), overcooking, or eating foods that contain thiaminase-producing bacteria (eg, raw fish). Deficiency also contributes to the neuropathy of chemotherapy. Thiamine deficiency has been reported to cause the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Scientists who first studied the outbreak thought that the disease might be caused by bacteria. To discover answers to their questions and to properly understand the disease, the scientists obtained blood samples from beriben patients fell ill. Surprisingly, even the control group suffered from the illness. Dr. Christian Eijkman, a member of the group of scientists working on the disease, observes that before the experiment, all the chickens were fed with polished rice. Dr Eikman later found out that whole-grain rice contains high amounts of vitamin B1 or thiamine, a vitamin necessary for good health, which enable the body to use carbohydrates as energy. It plays a key role in nerve, muscle, and heart functions. Thiamine is absent is polished rice.POST-LABORATORY QUESTION1. WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM? 2. WHAT WAS THE HYPOTHESIS? 3.
