Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nowadays, several people need the improvement in intensity and quality of character education implementation in formal educational institutions. This claim is based on the growing social phenomenon, namely the increasing juvenile delinquency in society, such as a mass brawl and various other cases of moral decadence. Even in certain large cities, these symptoms have come to the extent that is very disturbing. As the example, several educated people doing corruption in high institutions such as in attorney. These phenomena are obviously not expected to happen in the society. Therefore, the formal education institutions which are functioned to create the younger generation is expected to increase its role in the formation of personality of students through increased intensity and quality of character education.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>There are many personal characteristics that can affect a person as an individual and his professional success, namely openness, ability to learn and adapt etc. These personal characteristics can sometimes make a person successful and sometimes doesn’t. As I spend more and more time as a professional, I perceive that there are few characteristics that are essential for professional success: namely ambitious, creative and adaptable. These characteristics come out in many different ways. Have you set your goals? Have you decided the path you have to take to pursue your goal? What are the sacrifices you can do to achieve your ambition? How much can you think out of the box to resolve a particular issue or bring new idea to the table? How…show more content…</p><p>This characteristic will motivate me to grow better in my future career as well. </p><p>I believe that few people have a strong inner feeling that pushes them to think out of the box to identify as issue and find the solution. Personally, I always try to find the most creative solution and do not give up until I get it. Sometime this energy is contagious on to next. I always search for the missing links and fine-tune my thoughts until I reach a point that works. This creativity has steadily driven my ambitions through the organization. </p><p>Today the world is changing so rapidly and the way it has changed in last few decades, it hasn’t changed in last few hundred years. So adaptability has become the need of the hour. I believe that adaptability is the most important quality of all, particularly if one is in technology industry. There have been times when this adaptability has changed the nomenclature of day and night but it has also given me rewards at the appropriate times. Adaptability, personally, has created a far-reaching international outlook and I was able to spend time, living outside my country of origin, working for UK retails giants and this stay not only diversified my work experience but also my cultural experience. </p><br />

on the lines.
1. Your younger brother, who is in grade 1. has temper tantrums most of the
time. What steps will you do to help him develop patience and calmness?
2.
Manolo, your friend, is always sleepy in class. He has told you that he
surfs the internet and plays computer games until almost midnight.
What will you do to help him?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>1.) I will tell to my younger brother to relax and take deep breaths. Taking slow deep breaths can help calm the mind and body.you could all use a little more patience, especially in the fast-paced world we live in.2.) I will tell him to make or manage her time with his computer games , sleep and study time <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. it's unusual for your child to have a tantrum, when one does happen, clearly but calmly review the rules. Saying something like "I know you're upset, but no yelling and no name-calling, please" might be all your child needs to hear to regain composure. Then patiently give an instruction, like "tell me what you're upset about" or "please apologize to your brother for calling him that name." In this way, you're guiding your child back to acceptable behavior and encouraging self-control.</p><p></p><p>Also, tell your child what will happen if he or she doesn't calm down — for example, "If you don't calm down, you need to go to your room until you're able to stop screaming."</p><p></p><p>Kids whose temper outbursts are routine might lack the self-control necessary to deal with frustration and anger and need more help managing those emotions</p><p></p><p>These steps can help :</p><p><strong>Help</strong><strong> </strong><strong>kids</strong><strong> </strong><strong>put</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>into</strong><strong> </strong><strong>words</strong><strong> </strong><strong>—</strong><strong> </strong> If your child is in the middle of an outburst, find out what's wrong. If necessary, use a time-out to get your child to settle down or remind him or her about house rules and expectations — "There's no yelling or throwing stuff; please stop that right now and cool it." Remind your child to talk to you without whining, sulking, or yelling. Do not engage with them if they continue to yell or whine, as we want to teach them that they can gain your attention through calm behavior. Once your child calms down, ask what got him or her so upset. You might say, "Use your words to tell me what's wrong and what you're mad about." This helps your child put emotions into words and figure out what, if anything, needs to be done to solve the problem. However, don't push too hard for your child to talk right then. He or she may need some time to reflect before being ready to talk.</p><p></p><p><strong>Listen</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>respond</strong><strong> </strong><strong>—</strong><strong> </strong> When your child puts the feelings into words, it's up to you to listen and say that you understand. If your child is struggling for words, offer some help: "so that made you angry," "you must have felt frustrated," or "that must have hurt your feelings." Offer to help find an answer if there's a problem to be solved, a conflict to be mended, or an apology to be made. Many times, feeling listened to and understood is all kids need to calm down. But while acknowledging your child's feelings, make it clear that strong emotions aren't an excuse for bad behavior. Make it clear that it’s OK to feel mad, but it’s not OK to react to that anger by yelling or hitting. "I know you're mad, but it's still not OK to hit." Then tell your child some things to try instead. Some kids really just need to be "heard" first.</p><p></p><p><strong>Creat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>clear</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ground</strong><strong> </strong><strong>rules</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>stick</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>them</strong><strong> </strong><strong>—</strong><strong> </strong>Talk about house rules regularly so your kids know what you expect of them. Be clear about what is and what is not acceptable without using threats, accusations, or putdowns. Your kids will get the message if you make clear, simple statements about what's off limits and explain what you do want them to do. You might say: "There's no yelling in this house. Use your words to tell me what's upsetting you."</p><p></p><p>2. I will tell him that it is not right because we need to study hard for our dream. I will also tell him not to get too soaked in his computer because it is detrimental not only to his studies but also to his health. In order for him to catch up with the class, I will help him with our tasks if he has difficulty.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>You can summarize the number 1 if you want, i hope it will help you! good evening! </p><br />

                        <strong>The Filipino Way in building a Nation</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>In my task to build a nation, I know for a fact that I will rely on the Filipino way. I strongly believe that<strong> </strong><strong>Bayanihan</strong><strong> </strong>and the <strong>strong practice of respect</strong> should be <strong>essential </strong>in all nations. Bayanihan or the act of volunteering can help in the unison of the community. And we all know that a <strong>united </strong>community can reach <strong>greater heights</strong> in its progress. Respect is also a core trait of being a Filipino. However, in our case, it is only about respect for the elders, which I would like to <strong>change </strong>if I'm going to build a nation. I strongly believe that <strong>respect should be given to everyone</strong> regardless of age. It is also a part of inclusivity which is an emerging issue in today's society after studies show that an inclusive community means there are <strong>fewer inequalities</strong> which translates to a <strong>progressive nation. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Learn more about The Filipino Way here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2590627</p><p>#SPJ1</p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy.

There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.
