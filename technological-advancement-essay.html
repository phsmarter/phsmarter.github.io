Transportation is very important in our society especially in the rough times now in this pandemic to have a safe way to travel however the risks and problems to this are pollution and lack of human excercise, the reason I said these are risks from human transportation is because almost all our vehicles run on gas and they just destroy our environment and our health thanks to this gas and the lack of human excercise is because some people become too relying on these transportation that they begin to get lazy and then their body wont function the way it used to now having the difficulty of moving your body and the development of more body mass. </p><p></p><p>Sorry if it is too long you can edit this if you need to and I hope it helps</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, are organisms whose genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally. The technology used to create GMOs is called genetic engineering. The advancement in technology has been bringing more possibilities in genetically modifying organisms.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>My stand regarding the creation of GMOs is that it has the potential to bring many benefits to society, such as increasing crop yields, reducing the use of pesticides, and creating new medicines. However, it is important to consider the potential risks and ethical issues associated with GMOs.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One potential risk of GMOs is that they may have unintended effects on the environment. For example, genetically modified crops may crossbreed with wild relatives, creating new, unwanted plants. Additionally, GMOs may harm beneficial insects and other organisms that help to control pests.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another potential risk is that GMOs may have negative effects on human health. Some people are concerned that GMOs may cause allergic reactions or other health problems. However, there is currently no scientific evidence to support these concerns.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Ethical issues associated with GMOs include the fact that they may be used to create organisms with certain desirable traits, such as increased intelligence or improved physical abilities. This raises questions about the rights of these organisms and the potential for them to be exploited or mistreated.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Overall, while GMOs have the potential to bring many benefits to society, it is important to consider the potential risks and ethical issues associated with them. It's important to proceed with caution and conduct more research to understand the implications of genetically modifying organisms.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            28. how the advance of technology helps and destroy the natural environment in 3 paragraph essay</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The advances in technology have helped in many ways to protect the natural environment. For example, the use of clean energy technologies such as wind and solar power has reduced the reliance on fossil fuels, which has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, advances in recycling technology have made it easier to recycle materials and reduce waste. Technology has also enabled the development of more efficient transportation, such as electric cars and high-speed trains, which reduce the carbon footprint of travel.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, technology has also contributed to the destruction of the natural environment. Industrialization and urbanization have led to the destruction of natural habitats and the loss of biodiversity. The production and disposal of electronic devices, such as smartphones and computers, contribute to the accumulation of e-waste, which can contaminate soil and water. Moreover, the extraction of natural resources, such as oil and minerals, has led to environmental degradation, including soil erosion, water pollution, and deforestation.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the advances in technology have both helped and destroyed the natural environment. While technology has provided solutions to many environmental problems, it has also contributed to the destruction of the natural world. It is important to recognize the environmental impact of technology and work to minimize its negative effects while maximizing its positive benefits.</p><br />
