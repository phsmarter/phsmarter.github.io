                        <p>1. Rational choice theory is a framework for understanding and predicting human behavior, particularly in the context of decision making. It assumes that individuals are rational actors who make choices based on their own self-interest and seek to maximize their own utility or satisfaction. This theory has been applied to a wide range of social phenomena, including economics, politics, and sociology, and is often used to explain and predict individual and group behavior in various contexts.</p><p></p><p>2. An example of a rational decision or choice from my past experience might be choosing to study for a college entrance exam instead of going out with friends. In this case, I weighed the potential costs and benefits of each option and ultimately decided that the long-term benefits of studying (such as increasing my chances of getting into a good college) outweighed the short-term pleasure of going out with friends. This decision was based on my own self-interest and my desire to maximize my utility in the future.</p><br />
