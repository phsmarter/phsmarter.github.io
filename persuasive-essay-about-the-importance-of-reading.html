Read this: Shawn and his class were working on a new assignment. They were writing persuasive essays. When Shawn first learned about the assignment, he was unhappy. Shawn disliked writing essays, and he wasn’t sure how to go about planning and writing a powerful essay that would persuade someone to do something. So he asked Mr. Matthews for extra help planning his essay. Mr. Matthews suggested that Shawn begin by selecting a topic that was important to him. Shawn wanted to be on the football team, so he decided to write a paper explaining why he should be on the team. Next, Mr. Matthews suggested that Shawn list the strongest and best reasons he could think of that would persuade people. When Shawn had listed his reasons, he was ready to start writing. First, Shawn wrote a draft of the paper. He began with his main point—that he should be allowed to be on the football team. Then, he explained why he should be on the team, using the reasons he had listed. Then, he wrote the conclusion—the end of the paper. After Shawn had his draft finished, he was ready to revise what he had written. Shawn read the paper aloud to himself and to his parents. His mom and dad suggested ways that he could revise the paper to make it more convincing. Then, Shawn read the paper again. This time, he thought of a few persuasive details himself. After the revisions were finished, it was time to edit. To edit his paper, Shawn read it carefully to be certain that he had spelled everything the way it should be spelled. He also checked his paper for grammatical mistakes. Mr. Matthews had explained to the class that a paper is more persuasive if it is written carefully. By the time Shawn was finished editing his paper, it was written well enough that Mr. Matthews gave him a very good grade. The football coach read Shawn’s paper, too, and was so convinced by Shawn’s reasons that he permitted Shawn to work with the team!</a>

Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                            10. Do you think Shawn should be allowed to work with the football team even though he was not chosen? Why? Explain your answer. 
Read this: Shawn and his class were working on a new assignment. They were writing persuasive essays. When Shawn first learned about the assignment, he was unhappy. Shawn disliked writing essays, and he wasn’t sure how to go about planning and writing a powerful essay that would persuade someone to do something. So he asked Mr. Matthews for extra help planning his essay. Mr. Matthews suggested that Shawn begin by selecting a topic that was important to him. Shawn wanted to be on the football team, so he decided to write a paper explaining why he should be on the team. Next, Mr. Matthews suggested that Shawn list the strongest and best reasons he could think of that would persuade people. When Shawn had listed his reasons, he was ready to start writing. First, Shawn wrote a draft of the paper. He began with his main point—that he should be allowed to be on the football team. Then, he explained why he should be on the team, using the reasons he had listed. Then, he wrote the conclusion—the end of the paper. After Shawn had his draft finished, he was ready to revise what he had written. Shawn read the paper aloud to himself and to his parents. His mom and dad suggested ways that he could revise the paper to make it more convincing. Then, Shawn read the paper again. This time, he thought of a few persuasive details himself. After the revisions were finished, it was time to edit. To edit his paper, Shawn read it carefully to be certain that he had spelled everything the way it should be spelled. He also checked his paper for grammatical mistakes. Mr. Matthews had explained to the class that a paper is more persuasive if it is written carefully. By the time Shawn was finished editing his paper, it was written well enough that Mr. Matthews gave him a very good grade. The football coach read Shawn’s paper, too, and was so convinced by Shawn’s reasons that he permitted Shawn to work with the team!</h2><br />

                            15. Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />

 Circle the letter of the correct answer.
AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.
