Specifically, a case study or ethnography could be used to gain an in-depth understanding of the use and misuse of social media among senior high school students. A case study would involve examining a specific group of students and their social media use, while an ethnography would involve observing and interviewing students in their natural setting to gain a deeper understanding of their social media habits.<br /><br /><strong>RESEARCH SETTING</strong></p><p>The research setting would be senior high schools, and the participants would be senior high school students.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND PROCEDURE OF DATA COLLECTION</strong></p><p>The methods and procedure of data collection could include surveys, interviews, and observations. Surveys could be used to gather quantitative data on the frequency and types of social media use among students, while interviews and observations could be used to gather qualitative data on students' attitudes and behaviors related to social media.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND PROCEDURE OF DATA ANALYSIS<br /></strong>The methods and procedure of data analysis could include content analysis of social media posts, thematic analysis of interview data, and statistical analysis of survey data.<br /><br /><strong>ETHICAL CONSIDERATION</strong></p><p>Ethical considerations would include obtaining informed consent from participants, ensuring confidentiality and anonymity, and minimizing any potential harm to participants.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The statement "To be a researcher is to be a scientist" is not entirely accurate. While scientists are researchers, not all researchers are scientists. The term researcher refers to anyone who conducts systematic investigations or inquiries to develop new knowledge or to validate existing knowledge. On the other hand, a scientist is someone who uses scientific methods to study natural phenomena, establish new knowledge, or develop theories. Therefore, while all scientists are researchers, not all researchers are scientists, as researchers can come from various fields, including social sciences, humanities, and even business.</p><p>2.</p><p>Preference for specific design control for procedural bias: This statement refers to quantitative methodology. Quantitative research is a scientific method that involves the collection of numerical data and statistical analysis to make sense of the data. In this approach, researchers prefer to have specific design control to minimize or eliminate procedural bias, which could affect the validity and reliability of the research findings.</p><p></p><p>Primary reliance on researcher to deal with procedural bias: This statement could refer to both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. In quantitative research, researchers use specific design controls to minimize procedural bias, while in qualitative research, researchers rely on themselves to manage potential sources of bias. Therefore, this statement could apply to both approaches.</p><p></p><p>Preference for statistical summary of results: This statement refers to quantitative methodology. In quantitative research, the collection of numerical data allows for the use of statistical analysis to make sense of the data. Researchers prefer to use statistical summaries to describe the results and to make inferences about the population under study.</p><p></p><p>Preference for narrative summary of results: This statement refers to qualitative methodology. In qualitative research, researchers collect non-numerical data such as words, images, and observations, and summarize the results in narrative form. This approach aims to capture the richness and complexity of the phenomenon under study.</p><p></p><p>Willingness to manipulate aspects, situations, or conditions in studying complex phenomena: This statement could refer to both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. In quantitative research, researchers manipulate variables to observe the effect on the outcome variable. In qualitative research, researchers may manipulate situations or conditions to observe how people respond to different circumstances. Therefore, this statement could apply to both approaches.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
