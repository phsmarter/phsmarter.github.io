                                            international headlines 3.0: exploring youth-centered Innovation in global news deliveryTraditional news media must innovate to maintain their ability to inform contemporary audiences. This research project analyzes innovative news outlets that have the potential to draw young audiences to follow global current events. On February 8, 2011, a Pew Research Center Poll found that 52 percent of Americans reported having heard little or nothing about the anti-government protests in Egypt. Egyptians had been protesting for nearly two weeks when this poll was conducted. The lack of knowledge about the protests was not a result of scarce media attention. In the United States, most mainstream TV news sources (CNN, FOX, MSNBC, ABC) ran headline stories on the protests by January 26, one day after the protests began. Sparked by an assignment in International Reporting J450 class, we selected 20 innovative news outlets to investigate whether they are likely to overcome the apparent disinterest of Americans, particularly the youth, in foreign news. Besides testing those news outlets for one week, we explored the coverage origins and financing of these outlets, and we are communicating with their editors and writers to best understand how and why they publish as they do. We will evaluate them, following a rubric, and categorize them based on their usefulness and effectiveness.1. Summary of findings:a. Objective of the study:________________________b.

What Causes Truancy Among Grade 10 Students? TITLE The title should be descriptive, direct, accurate, appropriate, interesting, concise, precise, unique, and should not be misleading. Ex. Causes of Truancy Among Grade 10 Students PURPOSE - The goal or purpose of a research is to bring together different views, evidence and facts about a topic. Ex. This mini-research aims to know the causes why Grade 10 students are becoming truant. IMPORTANCE - A successful topic selection should reveal the goal orientation of the research, that is, what kind of goals the research should achieve. Ex. The results of this mini-research will help alleviate cases of truancy among Grade 10 students. This will assist school administrators, teachers and parents to think of ways on how students can improve academically and behaviorally as they will now be more motivated to come to school regularly. POPULATION AND SAMPLE - A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. Ex. The target population in this mini-research are the Junior High School students of Sindalan High School. However due to some constraints, only 40(computation on how to compute sample size was discussed) Grade 10 students will be considered as the sample selected randomly through systematic sampling (sampling methods) RESULTS - Data presentation obtained from accurate computations, through tabular or graphical methods with corresponding interpretations. CONCLUSION - Drawing conclusions refers to information that is implied or inferred. This means that the information is never clearly stated. RECOMMENDATION - Recommendations are based on the results of your research and indicate the specific measures or direction that can be taken. Note : This will be recorded as PERFORMANCE TASK .

                            6. international headlines 3.0: exploring youth-centered Innovation in global news deliveryTraditional news media must innovate to maintain their ability to inform contemporary audiences. This research project analyzes innovative news outlets that have the potential to draw young audiences to follow global current events. On February 8, 2011, a Pew Research Center Poll found that 52 percent of Americans reported having heard little or nothing about the anti-government protests in Egypt. Egyptians had been protesting for nearly two weeks when this poll was conducted. The lack of knowledge about the protests was not a result of scarce media attention. In the United States, most mainstream TV news sources (CNN, FOX, MSNBC, ABC) ran headline stories on the protests by January 26, one day after the protests began. Sparked by an assignment in International Reporting J450 class, we selected 20 innovative news outlets to investigate whether they are likely to overcome the apparent disinterest of Americans, particularly the youth, in foreign news. Besides testing those news outlets for one week, we explored the coverage origins and financing of these outlets, and we are communicating with their editors and writers to best understand how and why they publish as they do. We will evaluate them, following a rubric, and categorize them based on their usefulness and effectiveness.1. Summary of findings:a. Objective of the study:________________________b.

What Causes Truancy Among Grade 10 Students? TITLE The title should be descriptive, direct, accurate, appropriate, interesting, concise, precise, unique, and should not be misleading. Ex. Causes of Truancy Among Grade 10 Students PURPOSE - The goal or purpose of a research is to bring together different views, evidence and facts about a topic. Ex. This mini-research aims to know the causes why Grade 10 students are becoming truant. IMPORTANCE - A successful topic selection should reveal the goal orientation of the research, that is, what kind of goals the research should achieve. Ex. The results of this mini-research will help alleviate cases of truancy among Grade 10 students. This will assist school administrators, teachers and parents to think of ways on how students can improve academically and behaviorally as they will now be more motivated to come to school regularly. POPULATION AND SAMPLE - A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. Ex. The target population in this mini-research are the Junior High School students of Sindalan High School. However due to some constraints, only 40(computation on how to compute sample size was discussed) Grade 10 students will be considered as the sample selected randomly through systematic sampling (sampling methods) RESULTS - Data presentation obtained from accurate computations, through tabular or graphical methods with corresponding interpretations. CONCLUSION - Drawing conclusions refers to information that is implied or inferred. This means that the information is never clearly stated.
