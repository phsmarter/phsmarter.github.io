At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</a>

Lyubomirsky (2005) cited eight happiness ideas that we can do to be happy. Do kind things. This does not only bring happiness to the people you helped, but also to you. Remember good things in your life. Revisit a happy childhood memory or recall a time you made someone happy. Be grateful by saying “thank you” to the people who helped you. Being grateful helps us have a healthy heart! Spend time with your loved ones. We get happy chemicals when we bond with our family and friends. Forgive those people who hurt you. This helps you relieve the stress and burden your heart brings! Take time to exercise. Our body needs physical movement for a good blood flow. See the good things around you. Notice the raindrops and the flowers bloom! Work with your problem and stress. Learn how to balance your studies and play time.</a>

These include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, infections, miscarriage and stillbirth.</p><p></p><p>According to studies, women who bear more than 4 children are at increased risk for maternal mortality, so they need to plan accordingly. Women who get pregnant after the age of 35 are vulnerable to health risks, so they should be protected through careful planning as well.</p><p></p><p>Also, by reducing unintended pregnancies, family planning also removes the option for unsafe abortion.</p><p></p><p>When a pregnancy is unplanned, ill-timed, or too closely spaced, it affects the mother’s health which, in turn, affects the health and safety of her unborn child. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, an infant will have a greater risk of death and weak health if the mother dies while giving birth.</p><p></p><p>When a couple or an individual is aware of their rights and knows what their options are, they can make sound decisions in life. </p><p></p><p>Family planning can help a couple or an individual decide on what’s best for their sexual and reproductive health. By carefully spacing pregnancies, a couple can build financial security, allowing them to raise a family that they can properly care for. A family that is properly cared for is a healthy family, and a healthy family is the foundation of a healthy community.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>we are of opinion that instead of letting books grow moldy behind in an iron grating far from the vulgar gaze it is better to let them wear out by being read </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope it can help you</p><br />

                        I want my future family to have similar aspects of my current family, such as loving my children as much as my mom does, along with aspects of Gil’s family, like how even when he was stressed, he still stayed and cared for his family. Even as a child, I have always thought I would be a fun mother, and I hope to have a family somewhat of the likes of Gil’s. His children had fun, and, although he was stressed out often times, he found a way to still make time for what matters most: being with his family. I know it will be a little hard to obtain this goal, but I will try my very best to make a loving family who will go out on a limb for you. I believe a family should do anything for you when you need them most and I will shape my children into people I would want to be friends with. In order for me to try to keep qualities like my family now, I would need to work with the parenting styles my parents have shown me through the years.Hope it helps!

Are rich people really happy because they have everything? Are poor people really sad because they don't have anything? Explain. your answer.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:1.Socioeconomic status is the position of an individual or group on the socioeconomic scale, which is determined by a combination of social and economic factors such as income, amount and kind of education, type and prestige of occupation, place of residence, and—in some societies or parts of society—ethnic origin or ... 2.iin fact, new research shows that richer and poorer people are generally as happy as each other. Where they differ is in their level of sadness: higher-income individuals are markedly less sad on a daily basis.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: Thanks</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. There are various ways to identify the economic status of one's family. Here are some common methods:</p><p></p><p>Income: One of the most common indicators of economic status is income. Income can be determined by looking at the amount of money that a family earns from various sources such as salaries, wages, bonuses, and investments.</p><p></p><p>Education: Education can also be a good indicator of economic status. Families with higher levels of education tend to have higher paying jobs and better access to resources.</p><p></p><p>Occupation: The occupation of the head of the household or the primary breadwinner can also give an indication of economic status. Certain occupations such as doctors, lawyers, and engineers tend to have higher incomes than others.</p><p></p><p>Assets: The assets that a family owns can also provide an indication of economic status. Assets may include real estate, vehicles, stocks, bonds, and other investments.</p><p></p><p>Living conditions: The living conditions of a family can also give an indication of economic status. Families living in larger houses or in expensive neighborhoods may have a higher economic status.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that these indicators should not be used in isolation and should be considered together to get a more accurate picture of a family's economic status.</p><p></p><p>2. The relationship between wealth and happiness is complex and not straightforward. While it is true that having a certain level of financial security can alleviate some of the stresses and anxieties associated with poverty, it does not necessarily guarantee happiness.</p><p></p><p>Research has shown that once basic needs are met, such as food, shelter, and safety, additional wealth has diminishing returns in terms of happiness. This means that beyond a certain point, having more money does not necessarily lead to greater happiness. In fact, studies have shown that some extremely wealthy individuals experience higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression than their less affluent counterparts.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, being poor can certainly contribute to a sense of sadness, stress, and uncertainty, as financial struggles can make it difficult to meet basic needs and achieve long-term goals. However, many individuals who are living in poverty still find joy and contentment in their lives, as they may have strong relationships, a sense of purpose, and a deep appreciation for the simple things in life.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, happiness is a complex and multifaceted emotion that is influenced by a wide range of factors, including personal values, life circumstances, and social support. While wealth can contribute to happiness in certain ways, it is by no means a guarantee, and individuals who are living in poverty can still find meaning and fulfillment in their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A happy family is the foundation of a healthy and thriving society.

A happy family is not just about being together physically; it is also about emotional bonding, mutual respect, and the ability to solve problems together.</p><p></p><p>A happy family is a place where members communicate with each other openly and honestly. They share their thoughts and feelings without fear of being judged or criticized. In a happy family, each member takes the time to listen and understand the other's perspective, even if they don't agree with it.</p><p></p><p>In a happy family, members show love and care towards each other through simple gestures such as a warm hug, a kind word, or a thoughtful action. They celebrate each other's achievements, support each other in difficult times, and have fun together. They create memories through shared experiences and cherish these moments for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>In a happy family, parents play a crucial role in providing guidance, direction, and support to their children. They set boundaries, teach values, and provide a safe and nurturing environment for their children to grow and thrive. They also encourage their children to pursue their passions and dreams while instilling a sense of responsibility and discipline.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a happy family is a source of joy and strength for its members. It provides a sense of belonging, security, and purpose. A happy family is not just a product of luck or chance; it requires effort, commitment, and love from all its members. When families are happy, they create a ripple effect that spreads positivity and happiness throughout the community.</p><br />
