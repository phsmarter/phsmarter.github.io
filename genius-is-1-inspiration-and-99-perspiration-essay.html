                        I never know the answer of that question. I have just seen that statement for the first time!  But, if I am asked based on my perspective. Inspiration means to be inspired, to do better because of something, to be interested, or in short, to love and like what you are doing.  Perspiration refers to your sweat, and you get sweat if you work very hard. That means, to be a genius, you have to work hard and experience sweat, difficulties and pain. However, that is not all you need, you have to love being a genius, you have to love you dream to be a genius, because if you don't love something, YOU WILL NEVER SUCCEED IN IT. That, is just my opinion and I don't know the answer in general.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p>Inspiring Nations is an element of life that is all around us. It is a guide to loyalty of a nation; helps shape individual and national identities. We are able to come together within our country and be proud of our countries and all the similar identities we share. Without inspiring nations we don’t have restrictions on how we want to pursue our lives. There is no limitation to what we belong to and how we chose to go . We get to choose what we value how we express our beliefs. When Inspiring nation comes into play, it 's there to not necessarily to make us all the same but to remind us we should be loyal to our nation because it 's helped bring us together. </p><p>Looking at source one gives you an idea on how things can take a turn for the worst if you dedicate your life to the beliefs of one source essentially. Following one idea really changes your perspective on the world and how you think right from wrong.

Although we have such diversity, it doesn’t distract us from our values as a canadian. This was touched on in source three as it mentions how we have a “unique brand of nationalism” because of our multiculturalism. There is always opportunity to learn about the history of our county and how it was shaped to become the way it is. With the freedom we are given we can be our own individuals but at the end of the day come together as a nation and celebrate how fortunate we are to have these rights as a canadian. In the source it is also mentioned that we didn’t have a war to determine our independence. We were able to become independent through discussion .</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Everyone must have a source of inspiration and encouragement in their live. The famous idols like famous singer Agnes Monica, footballer like Christian Ronaldo, and famous actor like Orlando Bloom are some examples of famous idols giving inspiration and positive lives to many. If everyone has a source of inspiration from their idols, but not for me. As for me, my source of inspiration is none other than my beloved mother. My mother is someone who will do anything for her children. She is someone who very important in my life. She always helps and keeps me. No one can’t replace her place.</p><p></p><p>Mother is the most important person in our life. I called my mother, mom at home and everywhere. Now my mother is 55 years old but her look belies her age as most people are fooled into thinking that she is 5 year younger. She is very beautiful with black curly hair. She has black eyes and medium nose. She is rather plump.</p><p></p><p>I could still remember how she embraced me, the soft embraced and her hand which stroke my hair. Every day, I can still smell her perfume. I can still remember how she gently kiss me on my cheek and she leaves red lipsticks marks. I could remember how she always puts me in bed, whispering “shalawat” into my ears, and kiss me on my forehead.</p><p></p><p>My mother has always been very patient with me. She always gives me advises and support whenever I need them. She always in my side during good and bad time. She always lend her shoulder for me to cry on during the bad time. She takes good care on me and my other siblings. She nursed me when I was sick, she always anxious me when I don’t on her side. She angry with me when I do something wrong. She is a good listener when I told my story. My mother is one of the most important motivators in my life. It is because she always encourage me to study hard and always give me a lot of boost.</p><p></p><p>My mother works very hard day and night. It is because she wants to ensure that her children get comfortable life and can study well. That makes her doesn’t think about herself again.</p><p></p><p>Here I would like to thank to God for giving her in my life. No amount of money I can repay for all the kindness and love that she had given for me. I shall always cherish the sweetest memories of her for as long as I live. This memories shall always remain fresh in my mind. My mother is truly a source of encouragement and inspiration. I always love you mom.. </p><br />

                            19. inspirational essay about education ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I believe education is the most important tool you can receive, that can bring you most success in society today. Education lessens the challenges you will face in life. The more knowledge you gain the more opportunities will open up to allow individuals to achieve better possibilities in career and personal growth. Education has played an important role in the career world of the twenty-first century. A person with a higher education will be easily qualified compared to a person without an extended education; as one will be prepared to do various tasks that careers demand as well as meet job standards.</p><p></p><p>I also believe education is important because it helps us develop a unique perspective of looking at life. Education has played a major role for all individuals in the society. It has allowed the community to succeed both socially and economically by enabling it to develop common culture and values. Education is the reason our world is the way it is today, doctors have been close to finding cures for cancer because of a higher education; our technology has been enriched compared to the 19th century all because of education.</p><p></p><p>If the importance of education is not recognized, then someday education will become less relevant. Education serves to unite and strengthen our country. Without education people would not be able to distinguish right from wrong. If this should happen, then our society will find itself at a large disadvantage compared to other countries. “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” once said by a wise man name Nelson Mandela, and that is why I strongly agree why education is important.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>e Sulat mo nyang lahat ha , </p><p>goo</p><br />

II. "Irreplaceable" a word that defines my family, friends, and my culture. They were my main inspirations in life who kept my feet in track whenever I started slipping out, who became my source of energy and who helped me become who I am today. My family means everything I am the eldest child and I have been held responsible for everything that my parents tell us to do. My parents always had a high expectation from me and they hoped that I will be a good role model to my siblings. The responsibilities that were given to me gave me the opportunity to build a great relationship with my siblings, and as well gave me the chance to grow maturely at a very young age. I am very thankful to be blessed with such a loving family, and I know that they will continue to inspire me wherever life brings.</p><p>My friends and I are very close that we consider each other like siblings.

Everything is all basic we do not have any electronic devices for games like play stations, game boys and all that stuff. But we still manage to enjoy playing with each other by inventing our own games. In that way we learned to appreciate what we have and we feel blessed that we can have fun even in a simple way. My friends and I really cared for each other. We were very open to each other and we are always there to comfort or give advice to someone who is going through a tough time in life. The love and care that we have build for each other lead us to create a greater bond , and most of all a trust that would last forever.</p><p>My inspirations in life?, my family and friends, my family were always there to take care of me everyday, my friends make me happy whenever i'm not okay, they also listen to my dramas or whenever I open up to them, my family and friends are both really important to me, they mean a lot to me, and I don't want to leave them, I don't want them to leave me either.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love: Inspiration or Distraction?</p><p></p><p>Love is a powerful emotion that can inspire us to do great things or distract us from achieving our goals. It can be a source of motivation and drive, or it can be a hindrance that keeps us from reaching our full potential. Some people believe that love is an essential ingredient for a fulfilling life, while others argue that it can be a dangerous distraction that leads to heartache and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, love can be a great source of inspiration. It can give us a reason to work hard and strive for success, knowing that we are building a future with someone we love. Love can inspire us to be better people, to care more deeply for others, and to make a positive impact on the world.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, love can also be a distraction. It can consume our thoughts and emotions, making it difficult to focus on other important aspects of our lives, such as our careers or personal development. Love can also be a source of stress and anxiety, particularly when the relationship is going through a rough patch or when we fear losing the person we love.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, whether love is an inspiration or a distraction depends on how we approach it. If we are able to maintain a healthy balance between our love life and other aspects of our lives, then love can be a positive force that inspires us to be our best selves. However, if we allow love to consume us or neglect other important aspects of our lives in the pursuit of love, then it can become a distraction that holds us back.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, love can be both an inspiration and a distraction, depending on how we choose to approach it. By finding a healthy balance between our love lives and other aspects of our lives, we can ensure that love remains a positive force that inspires us to be the best version of ourselves.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS ^√^</p><br />

                            30.  1. Why do you think is curiosity the fundamental driving force of science? 2. In your own words and example, explain how poor objectivity can hurt and prevent scientific progress. 3. What is the value of negative results or failed experiments in science? How can you use them to make new hypotheses or new discoveries? 4. Why is it important for scientists to give credit to their sources? 5. In your own words, explain the ying "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration." 6. How did you feel about the lesson? Explain your answer.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Curiosity and curiosity-driven questioning are important for developing scientific thinking and more general interest and motivation to pursue scientific questions.</p><p>2. Scientists will alter hypotheses and theories when new knowledge is developed. Objectivity is important in science because scientific studies seek to get as close to the truth as possible, not just prove a hypothesis. Experiments should be designed to be objective and not to get the answers that a scientists wants.</p><p>3. Every failed experiment confers changes to the researcher's perspective. As such, the researcher is able to hone his skills and become better at researching. Failure also helps to change the experimental design by showing researchers what works.</p><p>4. To show your reader you've done proper research by listing sources you used to get your information. To be a responsible scholar by giving credit to other researchers and acknowledging their ideas. To avoid plagiarism by quoting words and ideas used by other authors.</p><p>5. The quote is attributed to Thomas Edison in an article in Harper's Magazine. With this statement, Edison is saying that works of genius, that is, things resulting from superior intellect or creativity, come from both inspiration (the idea) and perspiration, referring to the sweating a person does when working hard.</p><p>6.
