                                            1990 Earthquake wreaks havocin the PhilippinesMore than 1,000 people are killed when a 7,7-magnitude earthquake strikesLuzon Island in the Philippines on this day in 1990. The massive tremor wreakedhavoc across a sizeable portion of Luzon, the country's largest island, with BaguioCity suffering the most devastating effects. The epicenter of the quake, which struckat 4:26 pm, was north of Manila in the Nueva Ecija province. Reports indicate thatthe shaling went on for nearly a full minute. Collapsing buildings were the maincause of damage and death. Getting out of a multi-story building was a good safetyprecaution that afternoon, although many people were injured and a few even died instampedes of others doing the same thing. At Christian College, a six-story buildingcompletely collapsed, trapping approximately 250 students and teachers insideHeroic rescue efforts saved many, but some victims who did not die in the collapsewere found dead later from dehydration because they were not pulled out in time.All types of buildings, including several resort hotels in Baguio, known asthe Philippines' Summer Capital, suffered tremendous damage. Most of the city's100,000 residents slept outdoors that evening and during the following week, afraid toreturn to their homes amid the frequent aftershocks. For days, workers pulled bodiesfrom the demolished buildings in Baguio. The best estimate is that 1,000 bodies wereeventually recovered. At least another 1,000 people suffered serious injuries. Rescueefforts were bampered severely because the three main roads into the city wentblocked by landslides. Hundreds of motorists were stranded on the roads as wellOutside of Baguio, a chemical factory fire also caused terrible damage. The Tuba goldand copper mine in the area lost 30 workers when a mine collapsed. Baguio, sitting onat least sevea fault lines, is now listed as one of the most risk prone cities in Asia. Inaddition to the risk of earthquakes, the area's high annual rainfall increases thelikelihood of deadly landslides. American military personnel stationed in thePhilippine archipelago took part in the relief effort. The area was revisited by disasterless than a year later when Mount Pinatubo erupted. Some geologists believe the twoevents were connected.http://www history.com/thin-day-in-history/earthquake-wraalahaves in the philippinesExtra advertising​</a>

                                            Smash the Alcohol Addiction!
Many young people have stuck to their bad habits, drowned by their addiction,
lost motivation to become better in their life, and easily Iose their way when they have
problems. One of the reasons is the early addiction to alcohol at a young age. As
prevention, the Tarlac City School Division Office and Alvindia-Aguso High School
implemented activities under "SMASHED PH, an Alcohol Education Empowering the
Youth program of Depart of Education
Alcohol drink contains ethanol, an alcohol that acts as a drug produced by
fermentation of grains, sugar, or fruits. It will give pleasurable feelings and blunt
negative feelings to a drinker, but this can affect the normal development of the brain,
liver, and hormones. Starting drinking underage, especially age before 14 is
associated with increased high health risks, physically and mentally. According to
research data from World Health Organization, 9% of the Philippine's population
estimated at 86 milion who are 15 years old and above have an alcohol use disorder.
25% of males and 8.3% of females are heavy drinkers.
Peer pressure is among the most common reason for underage drinking. Lack
of parental boundaries, coping with an underlying problem, to appear matured or
environmental influences. Prevention of the alcoholism will have a positive effect on
mental health and improve the energy levels of the people. With the help of
"SMASHED PH," launched on April 22, 2022, with the collaboration of AAHS Supreme
Student Government and Barkada Kontra Droga, the students have thought and
educated about Alcoholism's effects on their bodies. They conducted activities like
Jingle making and role-playing acting a scenario about it. Aside from those developing</a>

                                            Stop the Stigma
Philippine Daily Inquirer /04:07 AM April 08, 2020
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are literally putaing themselves in haum's way to protect the greater Filipino
population against COVID.19. And yet, in an alarming twist, an increasing number of them, instead of being accorded the hero's
treatment they deserve, are being subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence, mainly due to unfounded COVID-19 fears.
Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision,
said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the
driver's explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital frontliners.

Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision,
said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the
driver's explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital frontliners.
Days before this, a mob ganged up on and threw bleach all over the face of a frontliner on his way to report for duty at a
hospital in Tacurong City in Sultan Kudarat, while a medical technologist in Cagayan de Oro claimed that some public vehicles
declined to let her board.
Also last week in Cebu, two nurses were barred from entering the condominium where they were staying after they
identified themselves as murses. It has become a common experience shared by many of their colleagues across the country; health
workers have found themselves evicted from eateries in Iloilo, turned away from their dormitories in Baguio, refused transport by
tricycles in Cabanatuan City and Quezon City, and so on.
Patients, too, are targeted. In a barangay in Tondo, a resident who tested positive was blocked from retuming to his rented
apartmcar. The health department's order was for him to self-quarantine at home since he was asymptomatic, but the barangay's
residents barricaded the street and refused to let the ambulance through, despite a Manila councilor coming over to try to resolve
the impasse. The patient, unable to return home to his parents who were elderly and thus at high-risk of contracting the disease,
was forced to find temporary shelter in a hospital.
Sometimes, all it takes is wild suspicion, and anyone can become an object of hostility and rejection. As GMA News
reported last Monday "A supermarket security guard lost both her rented apartment and her job after she went home one day and
seemed to have been running a fever." When a thermal scan showed her temperature to be above 36 degrees Celsius, she was told
to go the hospital first and have herself checked. The hospital determined she had no fever, but when she got back to her apartment,

                                            MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte promised to deliver a short State of the Nation Address (SONA), but the 100-minute speech he delivered on Monday, July 25, lost focus with off-tangent comments, analysts said. In his first SONA, Duterte ignored the teleprompter several times to make ad-libbed remarks, coming back later to his prepared script to finish the points he was making. Former Ateneo School of Government dean Antonio La Viña identified 3 main highlights in Duterte's speech: his reiteration of his war against drugs, the push for federalism, and promise of peace. But Duterte's winding speech, La Viña added, made it difficult to follow his main points. "The speech just went on in various directions...[It's] a lost opportunity because speeches like these are a moment to unify the country, make clear the vision of governance," La Viña told RapplerRappler editor-at-large Marites Vitug, meanwhile, said that the speech should've been adjusted to fit Duterte's speaking style. But political psychologist Cristina Montiel said that the ad-lib-filled speech showed that the tough-talking former mayor of Davao City cannot be packaged, and that he knew how to connect with the audience and speak in the language of the people. She also said that Duterte was "very complicated" and hard to figure out. Montiel noted the repeated use of war images that Duterte used in his speech, particularly when talking about his vow to be relentless in the war against drugs.

                                            1. On March 12, hours before Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte announced a community quarantine would be implemented in Metro Manila due to the coronavirus outbreak, an informal settlement in the city was demolished, leaving the vast majority of its more than 1,000 residents homeless. Days later, the quarantine was made into an island- wide lockdown of Luzon, where Manila is located, and many municipalities implemented curfews and other restrictions on movement. Within a week, the settlement's impoverished residents had lost their shelter and, stranded on the streets, become de facto curfew violators in the midst of a global pandemic. Answer:​</a>

The siege of Marawi: significance and implications
On 23 October 2017, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) announced that it had
formally ceased military operations in the city of Marawi, after months of clashes with proIslamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, militants who had captured the city on 23 May.
Sporadic fighting continued until mid-November. By the end of the 154-day siege, some 1,132
militants, soldiers, police and civilians had been killed, while 400,000 local inhabitants had
fled. Marawi was left in ruins.
The recapture of the city was a major setback for ISIS militants in Southeast Asia and
represented a significant development in regional security. The AFP, which had never before
engaged in urban warfare, prevailed in a protracted battle with courage and tenacity.
Moreover, several ISIS-linked leaders were killed and, as a result, the ability of ISIS militants
to stage a similar takeover in the near term has been significantly degraded. International
support for the AFP from Australia, Singapore and the United States served as a salutary
reminder of the importance of international counter-terrorism cooperation.
Yet the five-month siege has also set off alarm bells throughout the region. Notwithstanding
the AFP’s valiant efforts, the Philippine security forces remain poorly equipped and undertrained. ISIS has lost nearly 90% of its territory in Iraq and Syria and is gravitating towards
local conflicts outside the Middle East, including in Southeast Asia. Authorities in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore have successfully marginalized jihadist networks, such that they are
unlikely to be able to control territory within those countries that is sufficient to stage major
terrorist attacks. By default, it is probable that the Philippines, where the security forces are
spread thinly in the face of a host of challenges, will continue to draw in foreign fighters.
1. Who is the group behind the attack and what kind of influence do they holdover the
individuals who carried the attack?
2. Why did they target the city of Marawi and the people living there?
3. What could have been done to prevent the attack?
4. What social issues or problems did it present?
5. In what way, Social Science can be significant in solving such problem?</a>

                            10. 1990 Earthquake wreaks havocin the PhilippinesMore than 1,000 people are killed when a 7,7-magnitude earthquake strikesLuzon Island in the Philippines on this day in 1990. The massive tremor wreakedhavoc across a sizeable portion of Luzon, the country's largest island, with BaguioCity suffering the most devastating effects. The epicenter of the quake, which struckat 4:26 pm, was north of Manila in the Nueva Ecija province. Reports indicate thatthe shaling went on for nearly a full minute. Collapsing buildings were the maincause of damage and death. Getting out of a multi-story building was a good safetyprecaution that afternoon, although many people were injured and a few even died instampedes of others doing the same thing. At Christian College, a six-story buildingcompletely collapsed, trapping approximately 250 students and teachers insideHeroic rescue efforts saved many, but some victims who did not die in the collapsewere found dead later from dehydration because they were not pulled out in time.All types of buildings, including several resort hotels in Baguio, known asthe Philippines' Summer Capital, suffered tremendous damage. Most of the city's100,000 residents slept outdoors that evening and during the following week, afraid toreturn to their homes amid the frequent aftershocks. For days, workers pulled bodiesfrom the demolished buildings in Baguio. The best estimate is that 1,000 bodies wereeventually recovered. At least another 1,000 people suffered serious injuries. Rescueefforts were bampered severely because the three main roads into the city wentblocked by landslides. Hundreds of motorists were stranded on the roads as wellOutside of Baguio, a chemical factory fire also caused terrible damage. The Tuba goldand copper mine in the area lost 30 workers when a mine collapsed. Baguio, sitting onat least sevea fault lines, is now listed as one of the most risk prone cities in Asia. Inaddition to the risk of earthquakes, the area's high annual rainfall increases thelikelihood of deadly landslides. American military personnel stationed in thePhilippine archipelago took part in the relief effort. The area was revisited by disasterless than a year later when Mount Pinatubo erupted. Some geologists believe the twoevents were connected.http://www history.com/thin-day-in-history/earthquake-wraalahaves in the philippinesExtra advertising​</h2><br />

Alcohol drink contains ethanol, an alcohol that acts as a drug produced by
fermentation of grains, sugar, or fruits. It will give pleasurable feelings and blunt
negative feelings to a drinker, but this can affect the normal development of the brain,
liver, and hormones. Starting drinking underage, especially age before 14 is
associated with increased high health risks, physically and mentally. According to
research data from World Health Organization, 9% of the Philippine's population
estimated at 86 milion who are 15 years old and above have an alcohol use disorder.
25% of males and 8.3% of females are heavy drinkers.
Peer pressure is among the most common reason for underage drinking. Lack
of parental boundaries, coping with an underlying problem, to appear matured or
environmental influences. Prevention of the alcoholism will have a positive effect on
mental health and improve the energy levels of the people. With the help of
"SMASHED PH," launched on April 22, 2022, with the collaboration of AAHS Supreme
Student Government and Barkada Kontra Droga, the students have thought and
educated about Alcoholism's effects on their bodies. They conducted activities like

                            16. Stop the Stigma
Philippine Daily Inquirer /04:07 AM April 08, 2020
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are literally putaing themselves in haum's way to protect the greater Filipino
population against COVID.19. And yet, in an alarming twist, an increasing number of them, instead of being accorded the hero's
treatment they deserve, are being subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence, mainly due to unfounded COVID-19 fears.
Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision,
said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the
driver's explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital frontliners.
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are literally putting themselves in barm's way to protect the greater Filipino population

Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision,
said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the
driver's explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital frontliners.
Days before this, a mob ganged up on and threw bleach all over the face of a frontliner on his way to report for duty at a
hospital in Tacurong City in Sultan Kudarat, while a medical technologist in Cagayan de Oro claimed that some public vehicles
declined to let her board.
Also last week in Cebu, two nurses were barred from entering the condominium where they were staying after they
identified themselves as murses. It has become a common experience shared by many of their colleagues across the country; health
workers have found themselves evicted from eateries in Iloilo, turned away from their dormitories in Baguio, refused transport by
tricycles in Cabanatuan City and Quezon City, and so on.
Patients, too, are targeted. In a barangay in Tondo, a resident who tested positive was blocked from retuming to his rented
apartmcar. The health department's order was for him to self-quarantine at home since he was asymptomatic, but the barangay's
residents barricaded the street and refused to let the ambulance through, despite a Manila councilor coming over to try to resolve
the impasse. The patient, unable to return home to his parents who were elderly and thus at high-risk of contracting the disease,
was forced to find temporary shelter in a hospital.
Sometimes, all it takes is wild suspicion, and anyone can become an object of hostility and rejection. As GMA News
reported last Monday "A supermarket security guard lost both her rented apartment and her job after she went home one day and
seemed to have been running a fever." When a thermal scan showed her temperature to be above 36 degrees Celsius, she was told
to go the hospital first and have herself checked. The hospital determined she had no fever, but when she got back to her apartment,

                            22. MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte promised to deliver a short State of the Nation Address (SONA), but the 100-minute speech he delivered on Monday, July 25, lost focus with off-tangent comments, analysts said. In his first SONA, Duterte ignored the teleprompter several times to make ad-libbed remarks, coming back later to his prepared script to finish the points he was making. Former Ateneo School of Government dean Antonio La Viña identified 3 main highlights in Duterte's speech: his reiteration of his war against drugs, the push for federalism, and promise of peace. But Duterte's winding speech, La Viña added, made it difficult to follow his main points. "The speech just went on in various directions...[It's] a lost opportunity because speeches like these are a moment to unify the country, make clear the vision of governance," La Viña told RapplerRappler editor-at-large Marites Vitug, meanwhile, said that the speech should've been adjusted to fit Duterte's speaking style. But political psychologist Cristina Montiel said that the ad-lib-filled speech showed that the tough-talking former mayor of Davao City cannot be packaged, and that he knew how to connect with the audience and speak in the language of the people. She also said that Duterte was "very complicated" and hard to figure out. Montiel noted the repeated use of war images that Duterte used in his speech, particularly when talking about his vow to be relentless in the war against drugs.

On March 12, hours before Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte announced a community quarantine would be implemented in Metro Manila due to the coronavirus outbreak, an informal settlement in the city was demolished, leaving the vast majority of its more than 1,000 residents homeless. Days later, the quarantine was made into an island- wide lockdown of Luzon, where Manila is located, and many municipalities implemented curfews and other restrictions on movement. Within a week, the settlement's impoverished residents had lost their shelter and, stranded on the streets, become de facto curfew violators in the midst of a global pandemic. Answer:​</h2><br />

The siege of Marawi: significance and implications
On 23 October 2017, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) announced that it had
formally ceased military operations in the city of Marawi, after months of clashes with proIslamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, militants who had captured the city on 23 May.
Sporadic fighting continued until mid-November. By the end of the 154-day siege, some 1,132
militants, soldiers, police and civilians had been killed, while 400,000 local inhabitants had
fled. Marawi was left in ruins.
The recapture of the city was a major setback for ISIS militants in Southeast Asia and
represented a significant development in regional security. The AFP, which had never before
engaged in urban warfare, prevailed in a protracted battle with courage and tenacity.
Moreover, several ISIS-linked leaders were killed and, as a result, the ability of ISIS militants
to stage a similar takeover in the near term has been significantly degraded. International
support for the AFP from Australia, Singapore and the United States served as a salutary
reminder of the importance of international counter-terrorism cooperation.
Yet the five-month siege has also set off alarm bells throughout the region. Notwithstanding
the AFP’s valiant efforts, the Philippine security forces remain poorly equipped and undertrained. ISIS has lost nearly 90% of its territory in Iraq and Syria and is gravitating towards
local conflicts outside the Middle East, including in Southeast Asia. Authorities in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore have successfully marginalized jihadist networks, such that they are
unlikely to be able to control territory within those countries that is sufficient to stage major
terrorist attacks. By default, it is probable that the Philippines, where the security forces are
spread thinly in the face of a host of challenges, will continue to draw in foreign fighters.
1. Who is the group behind the attack and what kind of influence do they holdover the
individuals who carried the attack?
2. Why did they target the city of Marawi and the people living there?
3. What could have been done to prevent the attack?
4. What social issues or problems did it present?
5. In what way, Social Science can be significant in solving such problem?</h2><br />
