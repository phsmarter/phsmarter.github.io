His most constant vision to that of himself as tourist To visit Hongkong, Tokyo and other cities of Asla, perchance, to catch a glimpse of Rome, Paris or London and to go to America (even if only for a week in a fly-spacked motel in California) is the sum of all delights Consider the Pinoy abroad. He has discarded barong tagalong or "polo" for a sloek, dark Western suit He takes to the habiliments from Hongkong, Brooks Brothers or Savile Row with the greatest of ease. He has also shed the casual informality of manner that is characteristically Filipino. He gives himself the airs of a cosmopolite to the credit card born. He is extravagantly courteous (specially in a borrowed language) and has taken to hand-kissing and to plenty of American "D'you minds?" After a few days of these debacles, the Pinoy, sick with longing, decides to comb the strange city for a Chinese restaurant, the closest thing to the beloved gastronomic county. There, in the company of other Aslan exiles, he will put his nose finally in a bowl of rice and find it more fragrant than an English rose garden, more exciting than a castle on the Rhine and more delicious than pink champagne.

                                            “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</a>

How Our Cultural, Socio-Economic and Religious Background Have an Impact in Resolving the Covid 19 Pandemic in our Country?
by: Maricel Guevarra Veniegas
 The end is still not insight! Perhaps most of you will agree that the end of this pandemic which we have been battling off with nearly two years was still uncertain. There are many lives lost and victims who are fighting for their lives. Schools were still closed, our economy continued to slow down, and our movements were restricted. For Juan dela Cruz but not with Uncle Sam and other neighboring countries who seem to live back to normal. But why? What are the contributing factors why we can’t go back to our normal lives well in fact other countries can?
Cultural background. As for the latest statistics it was found out that rising cases of Covid 19 is the spread among families. Reported news showed that the virus spread fastly among households and family members. Filipinos are known to have a culture of close family ties. Many extended families whereas parents, married children and sometimes even grandparents are living under one roof. In addition, Filipinos have a culture of having too many celebrations and karaoke will never be absent. With this kind of belief, the spread of viruses is being hastened up. 
Socio-economic background. When strict implementation of quarantine was made many Filipinos resisted clamoring that they will not die with the virus but with famine since their daily needs depend on their livelihood. The Philippines is a developing country almost 75 – 80 percent of its citizens are on the poverty line hence these quarantines will even push them into poverty line. So, by no choice, they continue to earn a living despite the threat of being contaminated with the virus to feed their hungry mouth. Hence, cutting down the number of cases in the country is challenging on the government’s part since Filipinos need to continue earning.
Religious background. Among all the contributing factors presented this might be the least. Though Filipinos were said to be religious, the government successfully implemented minimum health protocols in religious gathering and even halted mass gathering that has something to do with religious tradition like fiesta, baptismal and the like.
To sum it up, the cultural and socio-economic background of the Filipinos have an impact in slowing down the mitigation of the pandemic. The pandemic did not change how we Filipinos live by culture and by our economic status. We continue to live together with our family and earn our living even if it will mean risking and losing our lives against the Covid virus.</a>

Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

In high school, history subjects were focused on Asian, World and Contemporary issues of the country and even the world. Tertiary level also lessens the subjects in Rizal and Political Science subjects as a minor subject. As a Filipino and history student, is it necessary for the state to prioritize history related subjects especially in the Junior-Senior High and College studies? Is there an impact for the development of the nationhood of the Filipinos if these situations will continually happen for the coming year to come?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Essay Example - The Philippines as a Developing CountryA country is classified as part of developing countries when they fall under a high rate of population growth, low per capita income, primary sector dependence, high unemployment rates, and dependency on exports of primary commodities. That being said, most countries listed as developing countries belong to Asia, such as China, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia.Even if they are on their way to growth, developing countries face more challenges along the way. The most difficult are decreasing poverty rates, access to quality education, and a good healthcare system for all its citizens. Third-world countries, especially those in Southeast Asia, are experiencing these challenges. One of them is the Philippines. The roots of the problems in the Philippines economy can be traced back to World War II, when soldiers from Japan occupied the country. The Philippines' worst inflation was then recorded in history.The Philippines struggled again with its economic growth in recent years during the Marcos era of Martial Law due, stemming from the negative image attached to the country. Marcos aimed to lead the country for consecutive terms and use the country's resources following his agenda. Oppositions against the administration then rose. This included Benigno Aquino Jr, a Filipino journalist, and politician who was assassinated right as he landed at Manila International Airport (now named Ninoy Aquino International Airport or NAIA). His death ignited the distrust of its citizens to its government. The Philippines' debt in the world bank increased from $600 million to $26 billion during the Marcos regime. The debt has caused macroeconomic effects in the Philippines, with the country continuing to pay for this debt using the current national income and remittances. At present, the Philippines is continuously facing a high population rate and low gross domestic product (GDP). Millions of Filipinos are still suffering from poverty and struggling with exporting their products up where inflow is greater than outflow of commodities within the country. <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>paki</strong><strong> </strong><strong>brainliest</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Demographic trends</p><p></p><p>The population density of the Philippines is high, but the distribution of the population is uneven. Parts of Metro Manila have a population density that is more than 100 times that of some outlying areas such as the mountainous area of northern Luzon. The country’s birth rate remains significantly higher than the world average, as well as the average for the Southeast Asian region. Efforts since the mid-20th century to slow the overall growth rate have had limited success, in part because reductions in the birth rate have been offset to some degree by reductions in the death rate.</p><p></p><p>Especially since World War II, population has tended to move from rural areas to towns and cities. At the beginning of the 20th century more than four-fifths of the population was rural, but by the early 21st century that proportion had dropped to roughly two-fifths. There is a considerable amount of Filipino emigration, particularly of manual labourers and professionals. Many emigrants have gone to the United States, Okinawa, Guam, and Canada; in addition, a large number of skilled and semiskilled workers have taken temporary overseas assignments, mainly in the Middle East and, increasingly, in East and Southeast Asia.</p><p></p><p>Economy</p><p></p><p>The Philippines is largely an agricultural country. Its economy is based on free enterprise; individuals and nongovernmental entities are free to participate in its development and management, sometimes with the aid of government credit.</p><p></p><p>Agriculture , forestry, and fishing</p><p></p><p>The agricultural sector is a major component of the Philippine economy, although it contributes only about one-seventh of gross domestic product (GDP). Crops can be grown throughout the year in the country’s rich and fertile soils, and the sector employs nearly one-third of the total workforce. The principal farm products are sugarcane, rice, coconuts, bananas, corn (maize), and pineapples. Additional products include mangoes, citrus, papayas, and other tropical fruits; coffee and tobacco; and various fibres such as abaca (Manila hemp) and maguey, which are used mainly to make rope. A wide variety of vegetables are raised for domestic consumption.</p><p></p><p>Rice, the principal staple crop, is grown especially in central and north-central Luzon, south-central Mindanao, western Negros, and eastern and central Panay. About one-fourth of the total farmland is used for rice growing. Since the early 1970s rice production in the Philippines has improved considerably, and in some years there has been enough of a surplus that rice can be exported. Factors contributing to this increase in output include the development and use of higher-yielding strains of rice, the construction of feeder roads and irrigation canals, and the use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Use of scientific farming techniques in the Philippines has had its drawbacks, however. The newer strains of rice have required the application of expensive chemicals that generally must be imported, and improper application of those substances has caused serious soil degradation in some areas.</p><p></p><p>Resources and power</p><p></p><p>Although the Philippines is rich in mineral resources, mining activities constitute only a small portion of GDP and employ an even smaller fraction of the population. Most of the country’s metallic minerals, including gold, iron ore, lead, zinc, chromite, and copper, are drawn from major deposits on the islands of Luzon and Mindanao. Smaller deposits of silver, nickel, mercury, molybdenum, cadmium, and manganese occur in several other locations. The Visayas are the principal source of nonmetallic minerals, including limestone for cement, marble, asphalt, salt, sulfur, asbestos, guano, gypsum, phosphate, and silica. Petroleum and natural gas are extracted from fields off the northwest coast of Palawan. Copper has remained the country’s primary mineral, although changing world market demands and investment incentives have rendered its production somewhat</p><p></p><p>Sana po Nakatulong!!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            8. “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. According to the essay, the basis of national strength is the character of its citizenry. The author believes that a nation cannot be stronger than its parts, and its weakness is its failings, while its strength is its power. I partially agree with this statement because the citizenry's character is a crucial factor in a nation's strength, but it is not the only one. Factors such as the government, economy, and social structures contribute to a nation's strength.</p><p></p><p>2. The peaks, valleys, and deep chasms that could hinder the upward climb of humanity are the obstacles that prevent people from realizing their full potential, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, and conflicts. These obstacles hinder progress and development, requiring potent social upheavals.</p><p></p><p>3. The author wants the Filipinos to be solid and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning, or the storm, and confident of their strength. The author also wants the Filipino to be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited, and imbued with good patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness. I believe this goal can be achieved with proper education, training, and social support.</p><p></p><p>4. To achieve the author's perceived goal, we must possess self-discipline, courage, industry, self-reliance, purposefulness, patriotism, social ideals, and solid moral fibers. These values will enable us to develop our resources, advance our culture, promote social justice, and secure happiness and contentment for all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.</p><br />

How Our Cultural, Socio-Economic and Religious Background Have an Impact in Resolving the Covid 19 Pandemic in our Country?
by: Maricel Guevarra Veniegas
 The end is still not insight! Perhaps most of you will agree that the end of this pandemic which we have been battling off with nearly two years was still uncertain. There are many lives lost and victims who are fighting for their lives. Schools were still closed, our economy continued to slow down, and our movements were restricted. For Juan dela Cruz but not with Uncle Sam and other neighboring countries who seem to live back to normal. But why? What are the contributing factors why we can’t go back to our normal lives well in fact other countries can?
Cultural background. As for the latest statistics it was found out that rising cases of Covid 19 is the spread among families. Reported news showed that the virus spread fastly among households and family members. Filipinos are known to have a culture of close family ties. Many extended families whereas parents, married children and sometimes even grandparents are living under one roof. In addition, Filipinos have a culture of having too many celebrations and karaoke will never be absent. With this kind of belief, the spread of viruses is being hastened up. 
Socio-economic background. When strict implementation of quarantine was made many Filipinos resisted clamoring that they will not die with the virus but with famine since their daily needs depend on their livelihood. The Philippines is a developing country almost 75 – 80 percent of its citizens are on the poverty line hence these quarantines will even push them into poverty line. So, by no choice, they continue to earn a living despite the threat of being contaminated with the virus to feed their hungry mouth. Hence, cutting down the number of cases in the country is challenging on the government’s part since Filipinos need to continue earning.
Religious background. Among all the contributing factors presented this might be the least. Though Filipinos were said to be religious, the government successfully implemented minimum health protocols in religious gathering and even halted mass gathering that has something to do with religious tradition like fiesta, baptismal and the like.
To sum it up, the cultural and socio-economic background of the Filipinos have an impact in slowing down the mitigation of the pandemic. The pandemic did not change how we Filipinos live by culture and by our economic status. We continue to live together with our family and earn our living even if it will mean risking and losing our lives against the Covid virus.</h2><br />

Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                            15. Based on the K to 12 curriculum, Philippine history is compacted on the basic and intermediate elementary studies. In high school, history subjects were focused on Asian, World and Contemporary issues of the country and even the world. Tertiary level also lessens the subjects in Rizal and Political Science subjects as a minor subject. As a Filipino and history student, is it necessary for the state to prioritize history related subjects especially in the Junior-Senior High and College studies? Is there an impact for the development of the nationhood of the Filipinos if these situations will continually happen for the coming year to come?
