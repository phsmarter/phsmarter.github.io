                            3. why local literature in research is hard to find source?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Local literature in research can be hard to find sources for a few reasons. First, local literature may have been written in a language other than English, so it may not be accessible to non-native readers. Second, much of local literature is published locally and may not be widely accessible outside the region. Third, local literature often covers topics that are not widely discussed in the international arena, and therefore may not have as readily accessible data or sources available. Finally, materials from certain regions, such as war-torn countries or areas where political violence is common, can potentially create ethical issues for researchers as it can be difficult to access or obtain accurate data due to restrictive government policies.</p><br />

The government of Brunei Darussalam worked swiftly to prevent the spread of the virus, including closing of schools and allowing parts of the working population, including lecturers, to work from home. As the pandemic spread worldwide and the country saw a surge of positive cases, strict isolation measures were put in place to protect individuals from exposure to the virus while curbing the risk of community spread. In keeping with nation-wide efforts to contain the spread of the disease, Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) moved its teaching and learning online for the duration of the ongoing semester to ensure that university students continued to receive their education [2].</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p>Front. Psychol., 14 October 2020 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.569348</p><p>Department of Didactics of Musical, Plastic and Corporal Expression, University of Jaén, Jaén, Spain</p><p>Background: The year 2020 has been marked by the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus has reached many countries and has paralyzed the lives of many people who have been forced to stay at home in confinement. There have been many studies that have sought to analyze the impact of this pandemic from different perspectives; however, this study will pay attention to how it has affected and how it may affect children between 0 and 12 years in the future after the closure of schools for months.</p><p>When news of an epidemic began to spread in a Chinese city in early 2020, no one anticipated the scope of the epidemic for the entire world in a very short period. From Wuhan (China) to New York (USA) through Africa, South America, Asia, and Europe, the new coronavirus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has paralyzed, to a greater or lesser extent, the life in many countries, causing thousands of deaths and about 6 million infections. For these reasons, the scientific community is on the alert by conducting studies on the virus, the disease it produces, the situation it creates, and the population it attacks, from different perspectives, including systematic reviews of the literature, such as the one presented in this paper.</p><p>However, in addition to scientists who study the pandemic, biologists, doctors, and humanists, educators are obliged to care for the psychological and emotional health, as well as cultivate the minds, of children. The consequences of the containment measures of COVID-19 are being detrimental to the mental health of people around the world. It is logical that the most vulnerable are children who do not understand what is happening and who, along with the concern and frustration of their elders, may present risk factors, such as anxiety and affective and post-traumatic stress disorders (Giallonardo et al., 2020). However, not only minors are affected. According to Roy et al. (2020), more than 80% of people over 18 have shown the need for attention to their mental health as a result of the anxiety and stress experienced during the pandemic. Forte et al. (2020) agree with this idea, stating that the pandemic has caused stress, psychological discomfort, sleep disorders, and instability, among others, in a large part of the population.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
