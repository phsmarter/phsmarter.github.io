Be guided by the scoring rubric below. For centuries, Philippines has become popular for its prolific writers when it comes to literary undertakings. Although Philippine literature at the turn of the 21st century is considered to have a brief history; however, most of its writers have already left significant marks in the minds and hearts of its readers through their writings. According to Uychoco (2016), Jose Rizal's undying Noli Me Tangere, casts a long shadow on Philippine literature, today's literary scene is quite different from what it was in the past. English as Second Language teachers still introduce this masterpiece to today's learners as it has emerged not only flexible but innovative literature that has been appreciated and used in various literary learning and even educational debates about language. Literary appreciation is a way of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas about the texts read. It is not just about reading and appreciating them, it is also about understanding their contexts. Through this, both teachers and learners will have a better and wider mental grasp of what they read. It is how we interpret what we read that help us gain a general knowledge of our history and strengthen even our very own personal reflection on our present situation. Philippine literature helps our Filipino learners catch a glimpse of our culture and heritage: that is to say, whatever literary genre we read moves us, triggers our wild imagination, provokes our sense of curiosity, and stirs our thoughts and feelings, upon our own common experience of our present situations.

                                            Directions: Identify what Literary Criticism is applicable to the following. (STRUCTURALISM, MORAL CRITICISM, MARXISM, FEMINISM, HISTORICAL APPROACH, READER-RESPONSE APPROACH)____________________1. The bible teaches us the value of forgiveness through the parable of The Prodigal Son, wherein the son asked for his inheritance from his father and left. He wasted all his inheritance and came back to his father empty-handed. He expected that he would have to beg for his father to take him back despite what he did. To his surprise, he was warmly welcomed by his father without hesitation. He was forgiven despite all his mistakes.____________________2. In the story of Cinderella, the Prince came from a rich family of royalties while Cinderella is just a poor commoner. Cinderella’s stepmother believes that she is not fit for the Prince because they live in two separate worlds of the rich and the poor.____________________3. The novel, Animal Farm, written by George Orwell was published in 1945. This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917. The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers. Orwell used the novel to make his opinions on Russian leaders. He couldn’t blatantly attack these leaders in his writings because of the censorship that British Media imposed during the 1940s just to get support from Soviet Union, so he allegorically criticized them using The Animal Farm. During the censorship, anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet writings were put on hold and were never published in Great Britain.____________________4. On June 17, 2018, workers at NurtiAsia Philippines went on a strike against low wages and unhealthy working conditions. The workers also alleged that NutriAsia practiced contractualization -- extending regular employment agreements to less than 10 percent of its 1,400-person workforce. The protest resulted in violent dispersal of the workers and on July 5 of the same year, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ordered NutriAsia to regularize 80 contractual workers.____________________5. The Autobiography of Veronica Franco, an Italian poet and a courtesan (sex worker in Renaissance Italy) talks about her struggles as a woman to gain a spot in the world of literature dominated mostly by men of nobility. She was labeled as an ‘honest courtesan’ for she fully disclosed in her autobiography her sexual relationships with intellectuals, noble men, and even with Kings. She used her social status as a courtesan to establish a name in literature because at that time, women did not have much voice in the society. What Veronica did was discuss and expose sexual issues, and for that, she was attacked by some of her male acquaintances for her boldness because men expected women to be reserved during that era.​</a>

                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Philippine mythology is the body of stories and epics originating from, and part of, the indigenous Philippine folk religions, which include various ethnic faiths distinct from one another. Philippine mythology is incorporated from various sources, having similarities with Indonesian and Malay myths, as well as Hindu, Muslim, Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian traditions, such as the notion of heaven (kaluwalhatian, kalangitan, kamurawayan, etc.), hell (kasamaan, sulad, etc.), and the human soul (kaluluwa, kaulolan, makatu, ginokud, etc.). Philippine mythology attempts to explain the nature of the world through the lives and actions of heroes, deities (referred to as anito or diwata in some ethnic groups), and mythological creatures. The majority of these myths were passed on through oral tradition, and preserved through the aid of community spiritual leaders or shamans (babaylan, katalonan, mumbaki, baglan, machanitu, walian, mangubat, bahasa, etc.) and community elders.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Portrait of the first man, Malakas, and woman, Maganda, who came out from a bamboo pecked by the bird form of the deity of peace, Amihan, in Tagalog mythology</p><p></p><p>The Maranao people believe that Lake Lanao is a gap that resulted in the transfer of Mantapoli into the center of the world.</p><br />

For centuries, Philippines has become popular for its prolific writers when it comes to literary undertakings. Although Philippine literature at the turn of the 21st century is considered to have a brief history; however, most of its writers have already left significant marks in the minds and hearts of its readers through their writings. According to Uychoco (2016), Jose Rizal's undying Noli Me Tangere, casts a long shadow on Philippine literature, today's literary scene is quite different from what it was in the past. English as Second Language teachers still introduce this masterpiece to today's learners as it has emerged not only flexible but innovative literature that has been appreciated and used in various literary learning and even educational debates about language. Literary appreciation is a way of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas about the texts read. It is not just about reading and appreciating them, it is also about understanding their contexts. Through this, both teachers and learners will have a better and wider mental grasp of what they read. It is how we interpret what we read that help us gain a general knowledge of our history and strengthen even our very own personal reflection on our present situation. Philippine literature helps our Filipino learners catch a glimpse of our culture and heritage: that is to say, whatever literary genre we read moves us, triggers our wild imagination, provokes our sense of curiosity, and stirs our thoughts and feelings, upon our own common experience of our present situations.

                            26. Directions: Identify what Literary Criticism is applicable to the following. (STRUCTURALISM, MORAL CRITICISM, MARXISM, FEMINISM, HISTORICAL APPROACH, READER-RESPONSE APPROACH)____________________1. The bible teaches us the value of forgiveness through the parable of The Prodigal Son, wherein the son asked for his inheritance from his father and left. He wasted all his inheritance and came back to his father empty-handed. He expected that he would have to beg for his father to take him back despite what he did. To his surprise, he was warmly welcomed by his father without hesitation. He was forgiven despite all his mistakes.____________________2. In the story of Cinderella, the Prince came from a rich family of royalties while Cinderella is just a poor commoner. Cinderella’s stepmother believes that she is not fit for the Prince because they live in two separate worlds of the rich and the poor.____________________3. The novel, Animal Farm, written by George Orwell was published in 1945. This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917. The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers. Orwell used the novel to make his opinions on Russian leaders. He couldn’t blatantly attack these leaders in his writings because of the censorship that British Media imposed during the 1940s just to get support from Soviet Union, so he allegorically criticized them using The Animal Farm. During the censorship, anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet writings were put on hold and were never published in Great Britain.____________________4. On June 17, 2018, workers at NurtiAsia Philippines went on a strike against low wages and unhealthy working conditions. The workers also alleged that NutriAsia practiced contractualization -- extending regular employment agreements to less than 10 percent of its 1,400-person workforce. The protest resulted in violent dispersal of the workers and on July 5 of the same year, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ordered NutriAsia to regularize 80 contractual workers.____________________5. The Autobiography of Veronica Franco, an Italian poet and a courtesan (sex worker in Renaissance Italy) talks about her struggles as a woman to gain a spot in the world of literature dominated mostly by men of nobility. She was labeled as an ‘honest courtesan’ for she fully disclosed in her autobiography her sexual relationships with intellectuals, noble men, and even with Kings. She used her social status as a courtesan to establish a name in literature because at that time, women did not have much voice in the society. What Veronica did was discuss and expose sexual issues, and for that, she was attacked by some of her male acquaintances for her boldness because men expected women to be reserved during that era.​</h2><br />

                            28. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />
