                                            DAILY ENCOUNTERS WITH GOD” Your class was tasked by the CBCP’s Episcopal Commission on Youth (ECY) to write a booklet containing short reflections about your daily encounters with God (scenario). This booklet will be published in order to inspire and encourage the Filipino Catholic Youth (audience) to recognize signs of God’s presence in the events of day-to-day life. You will work individually as writers or authors (role) since the task involves writing about your personal experiences or encounters with God. You will write and reflect about your daily encounters with God in your journal notebook (journal file), demonstrating the various signs (natural, biblical, liturgical, or ecclesial) of God’s Revelation around us (goal). Your CLEd teacher will read your journal entries and the best reflections may be submitted to the Campus Ministry office and used as reflection pieces for the school’s spiritual activities. Your work will be graded according to the following standards: 1. Content 2. Relevance 3. Creativity 4. Format Each story/encounter/experience should: Ø be within 15-20 sentences only; Ø have an appropriate title and symbol/image to represent the piece; Ø contain a concrete description of the event or experience which led you to encounter the Lord; Ø describe how you felt given the encounter; Ø identify at least 2 important realizations or insights that you had; Ø Be inspiring to your audience/readers, encouraging them to see God’s presence even in the simple experiences of daily life.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Why is Life Important?</strong></p><p><strong>One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one’s death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.</strong></p><p></p><br />

We would pack our bags, pile into the car, and drive for hours until we reached the small coastal town that we had grown to love so much.

The salty air, the sound of waves crashing against the shore, and the endless expanse of ocean never failed to take my breath away. </p><p></p><p>Over the years, that small coastal town has become a place that holds my heart. It's a place that I associate with countless happy memories spent with family and friends. I've watched the sun rise over the ocean, built sandcastles on the beach, and taken long walks along the boardwalk. Each time I return, it feels like I'm coming home to a place that truly knows me. </p><p></p><p>As I reflect on my connection to this special place, I realize that it's not just the physical beauty that draws me in, but the memories and emotions that I associate with it. It's a place that has seen me grow and change, and has been a constant source of comfort and joy in my life.

                        Paragraph 1 (Introduction):<br /><br />Leo Tolstoy's "The Two Brothers" is a short story about two brothers who inherit their father's farm and learn to deal with their conflicting personalities and desires. The story is set in the countryside of Russia during the 19th century and explores themes of family, responsibility, and the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />Paragraph 2 (Body):<br /><br />The main characters in "The Two Brothers" are not related to me, but I found their personalities relatable in many ways. While one brother is driven by a desire for success and wealth, the other is content with a simple life. This dichotomy reminded me of my own experiences with family and friends who have different priorities and values.<br />The setting of the story is effective in creating a vivid picture of life in rural Russia during the 19th century. Tolstoy's descriptions of the countryside and the changing seasons help to bring the story to life. For example, when describing the winter landscape, Tolstoy writes: "The white, untrodden snow stretched over the whole valley, reflecting the rays of the sun, and its cold, sparkling crystals seemed to penetrate the very soul."<br />The plot of "The Two Brothers" is interesting, but it may not be to everyone's taste. The story is slow-paced and focuses on the inner lives of the characters, rather than action or suspense. However, this allows for a deeper exploration of the themes of family, responsibility, and happiness. The climax of the story is unexpected and provides a satisfying conclusion.<br />The conflict in "The Two Brothers" is clear and realistic, as it deals with the struggle between two brothers who have different ideas about how to run their farm. This conflict is something that many people can relate to, as it is common for family members to have different goals and desires.<br />The theme of "The Two Brothers" is that happiness cannot be found through wealth and material possessions alone. This is demonstrated through the contrast between the two brothers, one of whom values success and wealth, while the other is content with a simple life. The story suggests that true happiness comes from living a fulfilling life that is in line with one's values and priorities.<br />Paragraph 3 (Conclusion):<br /><br />Overall, "The Two Brothers" is a well-written and thought-provoking story that explores important themes related to family, responsibility, and happiness. While it may not be to everyone's taste, the slow pace and emphasis on character development allow for a deeper exploration of these themes. The story has enduring value, as it provides a timeless lesson about the importance of living a fulfilling life that is true to one's values.<br />
