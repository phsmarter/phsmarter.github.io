some friends on a weekend trip leaving Friday night and returning Monday morning. You are not yet sure if this is a possible
business weekend trip with economic benefit, or a leisure activity weekend trip. They told you that your share of the
expenses (travel, lodging, and miscellaneous expenses) would be P500.

2. Calculate the accounting and economic profits considering that you will join your friends on a weekend

What is the theme of the poem? What issues does it tackle? 3. Why do you think it is difficult for the persona to reveal his/her feelings to the friend? 4. If you were the persona, will you reveal your feelings to a friend or just keep it in? Why?​​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The persona in the poem is the speaker, who is not explicitly identified as male or female. The persona feels a sense of love for their friend who sleeps on their lap, despite knowing that their friend loves someone else. The persona is conflicted about their own feelings and struggles with the desire to reveal their true feelings to their friend.</p><p></p><p>The theme of the poem is unrequited love and the pain that comes with it. The poem touches on the issues of societal expectations around gender and sexuality, and the struggle to express one's true feelings. It also explores the complexity of human emotions and how they can be both beautiful and painful at the same time.</p><p></p><p>It is difficult for the persona to reveal their feelings to their friend because of the fear of rejection and the potential damage it could do to their friendship. The persona may also feel that their friend is not open to the idea of a romantic relationship with someone of the same gender, which further complicates the situation.</p><p></p><p>If I were the persona, it would depend on the circumstances and the strength of my friendship with the person in question. If I felt that my friend was open to the idea and that our friendship could withstand the potential complications, I would consider revealing my feelings. However, if I felt that it would damage our friendship or cause unnecessary pain, I might keep my feelings to myself.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the poem is a poignant and emotional exploration of unrequited love and the complex feelings that come with it. The persona's struggle to reconcile their own feelings with societal expectations and their fear of rejection is relatable to many readers. The final lines of the poem are particularly powerful, as the persona expresses their hope that their friend will one day see them in a different light, while also acknowledging the pain that comes with such a desire.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The persona in the poem is a close friend of someone who sleeps on their lap. The gender of the persona is not specified in the poem. The persona feels conflicted as they know that their friend loves someone else, but at the same time, they have feelings for their friend. The persona seems to be a thoughtful and caring individual who is willing to sacrifice their own desires for the happiness of their friend.</p><p></p><p>The theme of the poem is unrequited love and the difficulty of expressing one's feelings to a friend. It tackles issues of gender expectations and societal norms that dictate who one should love and how they should express their love. The poem also highlights the pain and struggle of loving someone who does not love you back.</p><p></p><p>It is difficult for the persona to reveal their feelings to their friend because of the fear of rejection and the potential loss of their friendship. The persona also seems to be aware of the societal norms that dictate who their friend should love, which adds to their internal conflict.</p><p></p><p>If I were the persona, I would reveal my feelings to my friend. It is better to express one's feelings than to keep them hidden and suffer in silence. However, I would also be prepared for the possibility of rejection and the potential impact it may have on our friendship. In the end, it is important to prioritize honesty and open communication in any relationship.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

The persona feels a mixture of tenderness, affection, and longing towards their sleeping friend, as evident from the lines "He who sleeps on my lap, / I gaze at him with tenderness / In my eyes, a longing to confess." The persona's thoughts revolve around the feelings they have for their friend and the desire to express those emotions.</p><p></p><p>Theme: The theme of the poem is unspoken feelings or emotions. It deals with the internal struggle of the persona in revealing their emotions to their friend who is sleeping on their lap. The poem captures the complexity of emotions that arise when one has deep feelings for someone but finds it difficult to express them openly. It portrays the theme of unrequited love or hidden emotions, and the internal conflict and hesitation that can arise in such situations.</p><p></p><p>Difficulty in revealing feelings: The persona in the poem finds it difficult to reveal their feelings to their friend due to various reasons that are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that fear of rejection, fear of losing the friendship, or uncertainty about the friend's feelings might be some of the factors that contribute to the persona's hesitation. The persona's emotions are portrayed as tender and longing, but the fear of confessing their feelings and the potential consequences may hold them back from revealing their emotions to their friend.</p><p></p><p>Personal response: As an AI language model, I do not have personal feelings or experiences. However, if I were to imagine myself as the persona in the poem, I would say that it depends on the specific situation and the dynamics of the friendship. If I felt that revealing my feelings would not jeopardize the friendship and that it was important for me to express my emotions, I might take the risk and reveal my feelings to my friend. On the other hand, if I felt that it would be too risky or could potentially harm the friendship, I might choose to keep my feelings to myself. It ultimately depends on the individual's judgment and comfort level with the situation</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            20. write an analysis of the poem, He Who Sleeps on My Lap. Discuss the following: 1. Who is the persona? What is his/her gender? What does he feel and think about? 2. What is the theme of the poem? What issues does it tackle? 3. Why do you think it is difficult for the persona to reveal his/her feelings to the friend? 4. If you were the persona, will you reveal your feelings to a friend or just keep it in? Why?​​​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I can provide you with a detailed analysis of the poem He Who Sleeps on My Lap by Tagore.</p><p></p><p>1. The persona is not clearly defined in the poem, but it is evident that the speaker is a woman. She narrates how her friend often sleeps on her lap and how she cherishes these moments of closeness. The persona feels a certain degree of desire towards her friend, and she also hints at the possibility of unrequited love.</p><p></p><p>2. The primary theme of the poem is the complexities of human emotions, particularly those related to love and desire. The poem touches upon the sensitive issues of friendship, love, and desire that often become intertwined and complicated. The poem highlights the confusion, longing, and pain that come with unfulfilled desires.</p><p></p><p>3. The persona finds it challenging to reveal her feelings to her friend because of the fear of rejection and the possible end of their friendship. She is afraid of losing the closeness and intimacy that she shares with her friend, and she is unsure if her friend shares her feelings.</p><p></p><p>4. If I were the persona, it would depend on how strong my feelings were for my friend. If I felt that revealing my feelings would damage our relationship beyond repair, I might choose to keep them to myself. However, if I were confident in our friendship and felt that my feelings could be reciprocated, I would be more inclined to reveal my emotions. It would be a difficult decision to make, but I think it is necessary to be honest with ourselves and our emotions, even if it comes with the risk of losing something precious. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the poem is a poignant exploration of complicated human emotions, and it highlights the difficulties of navigating intimate relationships. It raises questions about the role of societal norms in shaping our attitudes towards love and desire and the dangers of suppressing our emotions.</p><br />

If you were the persona, will you reveal your feelings to a friend or just keep it in? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. The persona in the poem "He Who Sleeps on My Lap" is a woman. The poem is written from her perspective as she reflects on her feelings towards a male friend who is sleeping on her lap. The persona feels conflicted as she is torn between her desire to express her feelings to her friend and her fear of ruining their friendship. She thinks about the intimacy of the moment and how it makes her feel, but she also worries about the consequences of revealing her true feelings.</p><p></p><p>2. The theme of the poem is unrequited love and the complexity of human emotions. The poem tackles the issue of how difficult it can be to express one's feelings to someone, especially when there is a fear of rejection or damaging a friendship. The persona grapples with the intensity of her emotions and the fear of losing her friend, highlighting the complexity of human relationships and the power of unrequited love.</p><p></p><p>3. The persona finds it difficult to reveal her feelings to her friend because of the fear of rejection and the potential damage it could cause to their friendship. She is afraid of ruining the comfort and familiarity of their relationship, and she is unsure if her feelings are reciprocated. The persona also recognizes the power of the moment, where her friend is vulnerable and asleep on her lap, and she is hesitant to disrupt that intimacy. The fear of losing her friend and the uncertainty of his feelings make it difficult for her to reveal her own.</p><p></p><p>4. If I were the persona, I would consider revealing my feelings to my friend, but I would do so with caution and sensitivity. It is important to recognize the potential consequences of such a revelation and to be prepared for any outcome. However, keeping one's feelings bottled up can also be detrimental to one's emotional well-being and can lead to regret. Ultimately, the decision to reveal one's feelings should be based on a careful assessment of the situation and a willingness to accept the outcome, whether positive or negative.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps #KeepOnLearning</p><p></p><br />
