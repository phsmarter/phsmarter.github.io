                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

                            1. essay about mediocre teacher tells The good teacher explains the superior teacher demonstrates the great teacher inspires? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A teacher plays a significant role in shaping the future of a student. A good teacher can make a significant difference in a student's life by inspiring them to achieve greatness. However, not all teachers are created equal. There are mediocre teachers who fail to inspire their students and create a positive impact on their lives. In contrast, some teachers go above and beyond to become great teachers who inspire their students to achieve their full potential.</p><p></p><p>A mediocre teacher is someone who is content with simply going through the motions of teaching. They may deliver their lessons in a monotone voice and fail to engage their students in the learning process. They may also lack the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively teach their subject matter. A mediocre teacher can be described as someone who is just doing their job without any passion or dedication.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, a good teacher is someone who is passionate about teaching and genuinely cares about their students. They have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively teach their subject matter and engage their students in the learning process. A good teacher is also someone who is approachable and willing to help their students when they are struggling. They go the extra mile to ensure that their students understand the material and are prepared for exams.</p><p></p><p>A superior teacher is someone who not only has the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively teach their subject matter but also demonstrates how to apply that knowledge in real-life situations. They use practical examples to make their lessons more relatable and engaging. A superior teacher is also someone who is constantly learning and improving their teaching methods. They are always looking for ways to improve their teaching skills and make their lessons more effective.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the great teacher is someone who inspires their students to achieve greatness. They are passionate, knowledgeable, and dedicated to their craft. They use their passion to inspire their students and create a positive impact on their lives. A great teacher is someone who goes beyond teaching the subject matter and helps their students develop life skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a mediocre teacher is content with simply going through the motions of teaching, while a good teacher is passionate about teaching and genuinely cares about their students. A superior teacher demonstrates how to apply knowledge in real-life situations, while the great teacher inspires their students to achieve greatness. It is essential to have great teachers who inspire and create a positive impact on their students' lives as they shape the future of our society.</p><br />

The project, which stands for “Learning, Innovation, and Personal Development through Entrepreneurship,” aims to empower young individuals to become entrepreneurs and create sustainable businesses.</p><p></p><p>From the start, I was excited but also a bit nervous about what was to come. I had never considered myself an entrepreneur, and I wasn’t sure if I had the skills and knowledge to create a successful business. However, as the project progressed, I found myself becoming more and more engaged and invested in the process.</p><p></p><p>Through a series of workshops and mentoring sessions, I learned about business planning, marketing strategies, and financial management. I also had the opportunity to work with a team of like-minded individuals who were just as passionate about making their business dreams a reality. Together, we brainstormed ideas, developed prototypes, and even presented our business plan to a panel of judges.</p><p></p><p>The experience was both challenging and rewarding. I faced many obstacles and faced many moments of self-doubt, but I also found myself growing and developing in ways I never thought possible. The project helped me realize that I am capable of achieving my goals and that I have the potential to be a successful entrepreneur. It also taught me that I am not alone in this journey and that there is a supportive community of people who want to help me succeed.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Project LIPAY has been an enriching and transformative experience that I will always cherish. It has taught me invaluable skills and has helped me to discover my true potential. I am forever grateful for the opportunity and I am excited to see where my entrepreneurial journey will take me.</p><p></p><br />

                            30. liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</h2><br />
