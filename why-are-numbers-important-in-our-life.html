                                            REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.

In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Numbers are important in our life because they allow us to measure and quantify things, which helps us make sense of the world around us. Numbers enable us to perform mathematical calculations, understand statistics, track time, measure distances, compare quantities, and analyze data. We use numbers in various aspects of our lives, from counting money to calculating taxes, from cooking and baking to planning our daily schedules, from tracking our fitness progress to measuring our environmental impact.</p><p></p><p>2.Here are five situations where we use numbers in our daily lives:</p><p></p>Shopping: When we buy groceries or clothes, we need to know the prices of the items and calculate the total cost, including taxes and discounts.Time management: When we plan our day or set deadlines for projects, we need to allocate our time efficiently and prioritize our tasks.Sports: When we play or watch sports, we need to keep track of scores, statistics, and time elapsed.Cooking: When we follow recipes or cook meals, we need to measure ingredients, set cooking times, and adjust portions.Finance: When we manage our money or invest in stocks, we need to track our income, expenses, savings, and returns.<p>3.A pattern that I observe in my locality is the seasonal change in the amount of rainfall. I live in a tropical country, where we have a wet season and a dry season. During the wet season, which typically lasts from May to November, we experience heavy rains and occasional floods, while during the dry season, which usually lasts from December to April, we have sunny days and occasional droughts. This pattern affects many aspects of our daily lives, such as agriculture, transportation, and infrastructure. For example, farmers need to plant crops and schedule harvests based on the rainfall patterns, while commuters need to prepare for traffic disruptions caused by floods or landslides. Understanding this pattern helps us prepare for the changes and adapt to the environment</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps po</p><p>1. Numbers are essential in our daily lives, and we use them in many different ways. They help us communicate, measure things, understand money, conduct scientific research, and solve problems. Without numbers, many aspects of our lives would be much more challenging, and we would not be able to function as efficiently and effectively as we do now.</p><p></p><p>2. Budgeting: We use numbers when creating a budget, whether it's for personal finances or a business. We have to calculate income and expenses to ensure we're spending within our means.</p><p></p><p>Cooking: In cooking, we use numbers to measure ingredients accurately. We use measuring cups, spoons, and scales to ensure we're using the right amount of each ingredient.</p><p></p><p>Time management: We use numbers to manage our time effectively. We set alarms, schedule appointments, and create to-do lists to help us stay on track.</p><p></p><p>Shopping: We use numbers when shopping, whether it's comparing prices, calculating discounts, or figuring out sales tax.</p><p></p><p>Fitness tracking: In fitness, we use numbers to track progress and set goals. We count reps, measure distance and time, and calculate calories burned to help us reach our fitness goals.</p><p></p><p>3. One pattern that I observe in my locality is the rush hour traffic pattern. During the morning and evening rush hour periods, there is a significant increase in the number of vehicles on the road, leading to traffic congestion and longer commute times.</p><p></p><p>This rush hour pattern is caused by several factors, such as the traditional 9-5 workday, school schedules, and other daily routines that require people to travel during specific times of the day. As a result, there is a noticeable increase in traffic volume during these times, leading to slower travel times and frustration for commuters.</p><p></p><p>The rush hour traffic pattern has several impacts on the local environment. It leads to increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as vehicles idle in traffic, contributing to climate change and poor air quality. Additionally, traffic congestion can impact local businesses, as customers may avoid traveling during peak traffic times.</p><p></p><p>In response to this pattern, local governments and transportation agencies have implemented various strategies to mitigate traffic congestion, such as carpooling incentives, public transportation improvements, and flexible work arrangements. These efforts aim to reduce the number of vehicles on the road during peak travel times and improve the overall efficiency of the transportation system.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the rush hour traffic pattern is a common occurrence in many urban areas and has several impacts on the local environment and economy. It highlights the need for sustainable transportation solutions and effective traffic management strategies to reduce congestion and improve quality of life for residents.</p><br />

                            6. REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the early years, children extend on their knowledge of simple addition and subtraction, by expanding onto simple multiplication and division. The ability to solve simple multiplication questions, and use multiplicative thinking, is helpful for children in everyday life.</p><p>It’s all very well that we have technology readily available to give us all the answers, however, “understanding what the numbers mean and how they fit into the real world” (Palmer, 2012) is highly beneficial. Take owning a business, for example. Being taught and exposed to multiplicative thinking during the early years, would allow children, in the future, to calculate pay rates, profits, expenses and units, without the use of technology. Multiplicative thinking is also useful when cooking, doing grocery shopping, and calculating discounts of clothing items. If we learn from a young age not to rely on technology for the answers, we will then be able to utilise these skills out in the ‘real world’.</p><p></p><p>The ability to think multiplicatively from a young age also encourages investigative thinking and inquiry. This then provides children with the skills to problem solve, which again can be applied to everyday life. Multiplication can be introduced from a very young age, at its simplest form. Simple activities, such as making and sharing equal groups of blocks, introduces the child to multiplicative thinking, and gives them basic skills that can be expanded and challenged as they grow older.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p>#CaringOnLearning<p></p><br />

                            28. B. Read and analyze the poem below and answer the guide questions below. In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.
