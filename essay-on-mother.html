                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a satirical essay, Swift uses Rogerian strategy along with other rhetorical tactics such as specific diction, nuclear emphasis, and multiple double meanings to effectively surface the horrific treatment of the Irish by the English aristocracy. Rogerian strategy focuses on the “open exchange of ideas directed toward mutual understanding” with emphasis on conceding certain points to gain an understanding of the opposition and in doing so gain ground rather than losing it through a hostile exchange of right and wrong (Cooper/Patton 70). Swift carefully organized his essay so the audience, the English Aristocracy, would not recognize it as satire and dismiss it right away. Swift begins with a quasi-believable tone, one of an economist trying to solve a problem. The current “deplorable state of the kingdom” calculated by Swift consists of one hundred twenty thousand children who need to steel and beg just to remain alive (Swift 298). Many before him tried to provide useful solutions but failed. The Irish now left with nothing but what the English give them suffer mass oppression, the real issue Swift wishes to address.

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Swift establishes a mutual understanding with the English from the beginning, an essential part of the careful construction in his essay. He cannot let on the essay will take a dramatic turn after the flip of the second page. Swift does this because he wants to give the impression that he shares the same views on the current condition of the kingdom. He wants the English aristocracy to identify with him and his views. When he states “ I think it is agreed by all parties…” in the second paragraph and in the fourth “As to my own part…maturely weighed the several schemes of other projectors but have found them grossly mistaken in their computation” Swifts uses a small bit of Rogerian strategy (Swift 298). First he agrees with them on a small point so they are not hostile when later he states their past proposals have miscalculations. This bit of Rogerian serves the purpose of warming up the audience so they get used to agreeing with Swift and having an open mind to new suggestions much like an opening act does for the nights main act. Swift continues to warm up the audience by recognizing that these children are “a charge upon their parents” but more importantly to the English “a charge upon…the parish.” All the “warm...

                        <p>Mother earth is the world we live in. The trees we see around, the air we breathe everytime and the land we stand is part and parcel of mother earth. Mother earth is the embodiment of a real mother, in her warm and comforting embrace we are able to live and thrive. The trees and plants on the land which provide us with our basic nessecities to the vast seas which wonderful and amazing creatures live. Mother earth has graced us with vast resources all at our disposal but looking at today's surroundings, people had clearly took advantage and abuse the things mother earth entrusted to us to care and nurture. The sea is covered in plastics and chemicals that suffocates  marine animals inhabiting the water, the forest that used to shimmer in green no longer exists and instead is covered with skyscrapers and buildings. Species after species are slowly being extinct and decades after decades as the human population increases, the natural resource continues to decrease and is scarce. Mother earth is nearly at her limit, we may not be aware but she is weeping at what the world has become and what it will be centuries from now. If we continue are ways and continue to squander what's left of mother earth we will end up destroying the next generation's future. Mother earth should be taken cared of and nurtured just like what she did to us for many generations from now, not just for the sake of mother earth but also of the future generations as well.</p><br />

                            9. persuasive essay about teenage mothers</h2><br />
                        I dont really get the question but what I'm writing is about a persuasive essay for the teenagers to think twice before everything's ruin in order for them to not experience being a teenage mother.<br /><br />As a girl, it is really dangerous to be "too showy" and/or "too expressing" to one's feelings for another. Our emotions are really too sensitive and can easily be swayed away by a guy's so-called sweet acts and gestures making us enter to a relationship wherein we have no idea what's it really like except for "loving one another". But is that really all in a relationship?<br /><br />Guys that are not serious about you will eventually transformed the word "love" to "lust". They don't and won't care at all about our feelings and such rather, only care for the looks and figure we have right now. And yet why do many girls fall for such an act? One thing I have observed is that girls are desperate and are "too curious" as to what being in a relationship means. That's why they just go for it even when they knew the worst possible consequences expecially if being a teenage girl.<br /><br />Being a teenage mom, even when I just look from afar, is very difficult and tiring for those who have gone through such. And in the end, the girls would regret. As young as you are right now, try not to be involve in relationships that involve easy-going guys that only care simply for their desires. Act like a lady yet think like a boss. Do not be driven by your curiosity too because eventually someday your turn would be next in the perfect moment. And if you're a teenage mom, then whatever you do, you should think of your baby as your topmost priority. Even if you made a mistake, make sure to not let your son/daughter make the same mistake again. <br /><br />Be a good role model for them to follow and try your best in order to counteract life. Have determination and hard work to achieve the things you want to achieve for both of you. You shouldnt give up even when people or even your loved ones would discouraged you because for one, even when they think of you, you know what's best for yourself. And in everything you do, if your a believer in Christ, then have faith. Surely, God would guide you.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Everyone must have a source of inspiration and encouragement in their live. The famous idols like famous singer Agnes Monica, footballer like Christian Ronaldo, and famous actor like Orlando Bloom are some examples of famous idols giving inspiration and positive lives to many. If everyone has a source of inspiration from their idols, but not for me. As for me, my source of inspiration is none other than my beloved mother.

No one can’t replace her place.</p><p></p><p>Mother is the most important person in our life. I called my mother, mom at home and everywhere. Now my mother is 55 years old but her look belies her age as most people are fooled into thinking that she is 5 year younger. She is very beautiful with black curly hair. She has black eyes and medium nose. She is rather plump.</p><p></p><p>I could still remember how she embraced me, the soft embraced and her hand which stroke my hair. Every day, I can still smell her perfume. I can still remember how she gently kiss me on my cheek and she leaves red lipsticks marks. I could remember how she always puts me in bed, whispering “shalawat” into my ears, and kiss me on my forehead.</p><p></p><p>My mother has always been very patient with me. She always gives me advises and support whenever I need them. She always in my side during good and bad time. She always lend her shoulder for me to cry on during the bad time. She takes good care on me and my other siblings. She nursed me when I was sick, she always anxious me when I don’t on her side. She angry with me when I do something wrong. She is a good listener when I told my story. My mother is one of the most important motivators in my life. It is because she always encourage me to study hard and always give me a lot of boost.</p><p></p><p>My mother works very hard day and night. It is because she wants to ensure that her children get comfortable life and can study well. That makes her doesn’t think about herself again.</p><p></p><p>Here I would like to thank to God for giving her in my life. No amount of money I can repay for all the kindness and love that she had given for me. I shall always cherish the sweetest memories of her for as long as I live. This memories shall always remain fresh in my mind. My mother is truly a source of encouragement and inspiration. I always love you mom.. </p><br />

                        Answer:<p>Mother nature is important, she is essential for us to live. We should always be grateful for living in such a wonderful world. Make sure to make her feel appreciated by taking care of her. It pains me to think that some humans take advantage of the resources and overuse them. They are destroying nature. They won't listen to the complaints. We should make sure that they hear our voices, speak out don't stay silent. Being silent will only bring more harm. Staying neutral when Mother nature is calling for help is very selfish of you. Without her we would perish and suffer the consequences. We need to do everything we can to make her safe from the greedy people.</p>#CarryOnLearning<br />

                            28. reflection in narrative essay about losing a mother​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Losing a mother is an experience that is difficult to put into words. It is a profound and life-changing event that can shake you to your core. As someone who has experienced this loss, I can attest to the fact that it is a journey filled with ups and downs, and one that is unique to each individual.</p><p></p><p>When I lost my mother, it felt like a piece of me had been taken away. She was the one person who had always been there for me, the one who had nurtured and supported me throughout my life. Her absence was palpable, and I struggled to come to terms with the fact that she was no longer with me.</p><p></p><p>In the early days, the grief was overwhelming. I found myself struggling to get out of bed, to do even the simplest tasks. It was as if my world had been turned upside down, and I was left adrift in a sea of emotions. I felt angry, sad, and lost all at once.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, however, I began to find some solace in the memories I had of my mother. I realized that while she was no longer physically with me, she would always be a part of me. I found myself thinking about her more and more, recalling the moments we had shared and the lessons she had taught me. I found that I was able to hold onto her in my heart, even as she was no longer here.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were still moments of intense sadness and longing. Birthdays, holidays, and special occasions were particularly difficult, as I was reminded of all the things my mother would never get to see or experience with me. But even in those moments, I was able to find comfort in the knowledge that she had loved me deeply, and that her memory would always be a source of strength and inspiration for me.</p><p></p><p>In the end, losing my mother was a painful experience, but it also taught me a great deal about the power of love, the resilience of the human spirit, and the importance of cherishing the moments we have with the people we love. I will always miss my mother, but I will also always carry her with me, in my heart and in my memories.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The day my mother passed away, I remember feeling numb. It was as if my brain couldn't process what had just happened. I felt like I was in a dream, a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from. It wasn't until the funeral that it hit me that she was really gone. I felt like I had lost a piece of myself that day, and I didn't know how to fill the void.</p><p></p><p>The days that followed were filled with sadness and grief. It was hard to accept that my mother was no longer with me. I would often find myself crying in the middle of the day, unable to control my emotions. I missed her laugh, her smile, and her love. It was a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, I learned to live without my mother, but the pain never went away. I would often find myself thinking about her and what she would say or do in certain situations. Her memory was always with me, and it brought me comfort knowing that she was still a part of my life in some way.</p><p></p><p>Losing a mother taught me a lot about life. It taught me to cherish the moments I have with my loved ones and to never take them for granted. It taught me to be grateful for the time I had with my mother and to always remember the love she gave me.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In conclusion, losing a mother is one of the hardest things anyone can go through. It is a pain that never fully goes away, but with time, you learn to live with it. My mother will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will always be grateful for the time I had with her.</p><br />

At the core of this celebration is my joy over the certainty of my decision to entrust myself to the Blessed Virgin Mary, who gave birth to our Lord Jesus Christ. Last November 21, 2013 during the feast of the Presentation of Mary, I entrusted myself to the Blessed Virgin Mary for the fourth time. Two of my dear friends, Shannon McAvoy and Charie Mosqueda, also consecrated themselves to Mama Mary on that day. The sisters at the Presentation of Mary Discernment House here in Saskatoon, Canada, namely Sr. Evelyn, Sr. Lucy and Sr. Cindy, made it more special by incorporating a ritual of entrustment.</p><br />
