Read the argumentative essay and complete the argument chart.Topic:Claim:Arguments:a.b.C.d.Counterarguments:a100Note: An argument shows support for the author's claim (for example: reasons, evidence, data and statistics) while a counterargument explains the opposite point of view.   individualism is a fundamental part of a society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status.

                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status.

                        <p>School is useful for many things. It has may advantages seen and that is why it was acquired int the curriculum of education. But can it become a negative factor of students' mental health?</p><p>The pressure of school does not only lie on the subjects and the due dates and other things relating to that, but it also lies on the pressure of prebuscent children trying to fit in with their peers and trying to balance their educational reputation with their family, friends, and other things. Stress is becoming a very common factor of emerging mental problems among teenagers and growing children. What contributes more to this is the fact that those who are suffering now from a different level of stress suffer from more stress of not being able to talk to anybody due to fear of judgment. Stress is also an underrated topic, peoplebarely talk about this that is why the awareness towards this is very low, leading to a risk and chance that is very high. On the other side of school's pressure on students, there is a side that is even more stressful and it is beyond the school's boundaries. It may be a matter regarding family, friends, faith, and other things.</p><p>Do not be afraid to talk about your problems to make yourself be lifted up from a greater weight on your shoulders. Mental health is very important that is why, if you're feeling very tense and pressured, feel free to give yourself a break. Stress can be deadly, which is why you must take care of your time and your priorities. Take life positively, so that you'll be able to lead a better future with a healthy heart and mind.</p><br />

Conclusion</p><p></p><p>Recap of the pros and cons of extracurricular activities</p><p>The need for a balanced approach to extracurricular participation</p><p>Essay:</p><p>Extracurricular activities, such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteer organizations, are a common part of the high school and college experience. These activities can provide numerous benefits to students, including improved time management skills, enhanced social skills and teamwork abilities, and increased academic performance. However, extracurricular activities also have the potential to cause stress and financial strain. It is important for students and families to carefully consider the pros and cons of extracurricular participation and find a balance that works for them.</p><p></p><p>One of the major benefits of extracurricular activities is the opportunity to develop time management skills. Participating in extracurricular activities requires students to prioritize their responsibilities and manage their time effectively. This can be especially beneficial for students who struggle with time management or procrastination, as it provides a structured environment where they can practice these skills. In addition to improving time management, extracurricular activities can also enhance social skills and teamwork abilities. Students who participate in extracurricular activities often have the opportunity to work with a diverse group of peers, which can help them develop communication and collaboration skills. These skills are important for success in both academic and professional settings.</p><p></p><p>Another benefit of extracurricular activities is the potential for increased academic performance. Studies have shown that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have higher grades and are more likely to graduate from high school and college. This may be due, in part, to the time management and teamwork skills developed through extracurricular participation. Additionally, extracurricular activities can provide a sense of purpose and motivation for students, which can translate into increased engagement and performance in their academic studies.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also potential downsides to extracurricular activities. One concern is the increased stress and time commitments that these activities can bring. Participating in extracurricular activities requires a significant time investment, which can be especially challenging for students who are already struggling to balance schoolwork and other responsibilities. Additionally, extracurricular activities can sometimes create a competitive environment that can increase pressure and stress for students. Another potential downside of extracurricular activities is the financial burden they can place on families. Participation in certain extracurricular activities, such as sports teams or music programs, can be expensive due to the cost of equipment, uniforms, and transportation. This can be a barrier for some students and families, leading to unequal access and opportunities based on socio-economic status.</p><p></p><p>Given the pros and cons of extracurricular activities, it is important for students and families to find a balance that works for them.

Synonyms: Teenagers face enormous peer pressure from friends and schoolmates. As a result, many are exhibiting signs of severe stress or depression at an early age. 2. Repetition: Most students are intimidated by the works of William Shakespeare. They believe sonnets and plays are far too complicated to read and understand. 3-4. Transitional Words: Many students think they cannot write a good essay they are not writers. as they practice writing and work on developing their writing skills, most students can gain the needed confidence to create coherent paragraphs. 5. Pronouns: Mrs. Thompson agreed to meet with the worker's union members before signing the contract. Her interest in hearing about the new insurance plan is overwhelming. concerns​</h2><br />

In conclusion, the answer is Shakespeare's since it refers to the sonnets and plays. </p><p></p><p>3. The best answer to that is the word "and" as for the reason that the sentences complement/ go well with each other. Therefore, the answer Is <strong>and.</strong></p><p></p><p>4. Since the blanked in the sentence go first. However because the first sentence was a negative statement while the second sentence states positive. Since the paragraph <strong>are </strong><strong>contradictory/</strong><strong>comparing,</strong><strong> </strong>we use However to complete the statement. You can also use <strong>"</strong><strong>On </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>contrary"</strong><strong> </strong>to show more emphasis to the sentence.</p><p></p><p>5.

Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</h2><br />

Wearing school uniforms would simplify students' lives and eliminate the stress of deciding what to wear every day.</p><p></p><p>b. School uniforms help students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals, as they create a feeling of unity and give the message that school is a special place for learning.

Some may argue that school uniforms limit students' self-expression and creativity. However, students can still express themselves through accessories or other means outside of clothing. Moreover, uniforms promote a sense of unity and belonging, which may be more important in a school environment.</p><p></p><p>b. Others may argue that implementing school uniforms can be costly for families who cannot afford them. However, many schools have programs to help families obtain uniforms at a low cost or for free. Additionally, over time, uniforms can save money for families who would otherwise have to purchase expensive clothing for school.</p><p></p><p>c. Some may argue that school uniforms do not address the root causes of student behavior problems and that other solutions should be explored.

                            10. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Cheating</p><p>2. Cheating is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students.</p><p>3.

I agree with the reason that I believe, rather than cheat, students must learn how to balance their own time between studying and relaxing to be more productive, honest, and good students.

The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform?

For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal.

The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons. First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore. Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced. Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing.​</h2><br />
