The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.
Can you infer where I am?</a>

                        Online game addiction has become a growing social issue in schools around the world, and my school is no exception. With the widespread availability and accessibility of online games, more and more students are becoming addicted to playing these games, causing detrimental effects on their academic performance, social relationships, and overall well-being. As a concerned student, it is imperative that we address this issue and find appropriate solutions to help those who are struggling with online game addiction.<br /><br />One possible solution to address online game addiction is to increase awareness and education among students, parents, and teachers. By providing information and resources on the potential risks and consequences of excessive online gaming, students can better understand the impact of their behavior and take necessary steps to reduce their gaming time. Moreover, parents and teachers can also monitor and regulate their children's online gaming habits.<br /><br />Another solution is to provide alternative forms of entertainment and activities that promote healthy social interaction and physical exercise. For instance, schools can organize sports events, group activities, and other extracurricular activities that encourage students to engage in healthy and social activities instead of being glued to their screens. Additionally, schools can provide counseling services to help students cope with addiction and provide them with the necessary support and guidance to overcome their addiction.<br /><br />Moreover, online gaming companies should also play a role in addressing this issue by implementing regulations and restrictions to prevent addiction. They can limit the amount of time players spend online, or implement features that encourage users to take breaks and engage in other activities. Furthermore, they can promote healthy gaming practices and encourage users to engage in real-life activities and social interactions.<br /><br />In conclusion, online game addiction is a serious social issue that must be addressed at the school, family, and community level. By increasing awareness, providing alternative forms of entertainment, offering counseling services, and regulating online gaming practices, we can help prevent and reduce the detrimental effects of online game addiction. It is essential that we work together to find appropriate solutions to address this issue and promote healthy habits among our students.<br /><br />Brainliest moto!!<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>In today's digital age, online gaming has become a popular pastime among children and teenagers.

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.

                            15. Exercise vs. Video Games Do you exercise regularly? Recently, a lot of video games and other online entertainment activities have been popping in the internet. This led to a decline of physical activity among children, making it easy to get used to the habit of not exercising. Exercise has many benefits. For instance, studies show that it boosts academic performance. In addition to that, it has been proven that children who exercise more develop healthy habits later in life. In conclusion, having plenty of exercise at your young age is a brilliant idea. Exercise needs to be established as a routine for children like you. This can be achieved if you include exercise in your daily activities. My topic is... who is article about ? why is it important for people to know about this?​</h2><br />
