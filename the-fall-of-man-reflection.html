                                            n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                                            Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

A rainbow is formed when light (generally sunlight) passes through water droplets hanging in the atmosphere. The white light enters the water droplet, where it bends in several different directions.

There I'll come when I'm a man With a camel caravan;Light a fire in the gloomOf some dusty dining-room;See the pictures on the walls, Heroes fights and festivals; And in a corner find the toys Of the old Egyptian boys.​</a>

This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                                            THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.

                                            Taro, The Great SpiderBy Menere R. NasiadIn a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens. After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people. The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see theenormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro,The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village. The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea. “I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him.“How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked.“I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland.Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. Ayan po yung story pls po need ko na po brainliest ko agar sagot pag matino​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Narration means the art of storytelling, and the purpose of narrative writing is to tell stories. Any time you tell a story to a friend or family member about an event or incident in your day, you engage in a form of narration. In addition, a narrative can be factual or fictional. A factual story is one that is based on, and tries to be faithful to, actual events as they unfolded in real life. A fictional story is a made-up, or imagined, story; the writer of a fictional story can create characters and events as he or she sees fit.
</p><p>
</p><p>The big distinction between factual and fictional narratives is based on a writer’s purpose. The writers of factual stories try to recount events as they actually happened, but writers of fictional stories can depart from real people and events because the writers’ intents are not to retell a real-life event. Biographies and memoirs are examples of factual stories, whereas novels and short stories are examples of fictional stories.
</p><p>
</p><p>Explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>Because the line between fact and fiction can often blur, it is helpful to understand what your purpose is from the beginning. Is it important that you recount history, either your own or someone else’s? Or does your interest lie in reshaping the world in your own image—either how you would like to see it or how you imagine it could be? Your answers will go a long way in shaping the stories you tell.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ultimately, whether the story is fact or fiction, narrative writing tries to relay a series of events in an emotionally engaging way. You want your audience to be moved by your story, which could mean through laughter, sympathy, fear, anger, and so on. The more clearly you tell your story, the more emotionally engaged your audience is likely</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            6. n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers.

When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad.

Reflection poem about the poem entitled Travel by Robert Louis Stevenson.TRAVELRobert Louis StevensonI should like to rise and goWhere the golden apples grow;-- Where below another skyParrot islands anchored lie,And, watched by cockatoos and goats, Lonely Crusoes building boats;--Where in sunshine reaching outEastern cities, miles about,Are with mosque and minaretAmong sandy gardens set,And the rich goods from near and farHang for sale in the bazaar;--Where the Great Wall round China goes,And on one side the desert blows,And with the voice and bell and drum,Cities on the other hum;--Where are forests hot as fire,Wide as England, tall as a spire,Full of apes and cocoa-nutsAnd the negro hunters' huts;--Where the knotty crocodile Lies and blinks in the Nile, And the red flamingo flies Hunting fish before his eyes;-- Where in jungles near and far, Man-devouring tigers are,Lying close and giving earLest the hunt be drawing near,Or a comer-by be seenSwinging in the palanquin;-- Where among the desert sandsSome deserted city stands,All its children, sweep and prince, Grown to manhood ages since, Not a foot in street or house, Not a stir of child or mouse, And when kindly falls the night, In all the town no spark of light. There I'll come when I'm a man With a camel caravan;Light a fire in the gloomOf some dusty dining-room;See the pictures on the walls, Heroes fights and festivals; And in a corner find the toys Of the old Egyptian boys.​</h2><br />

This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Narration means the art of storytelling, and the purpose of narrative writing is to tell stories. Any time you tell a story to a friend or family member about an event or incident in your day, you engage in a form of narration. In addition, a narrative can be factual or fictional. A factual story is one that is based on, and tries to be faithful to, actual events as they unfolded in real life. A fictional story is a made-up, or imagined, story; the writer of a fictional story can create characters and events as he or she sees fit.</p><p></p><p>The big distinction between factual and fictional narratives is based on a writer’s purpose. The writers of factual stories try to recount events as they actually happened, but writers of fictional stories can depart from real people and events because the writers’ intents are not to retell a real-life event. Biographies and memoirs are examples of factual stories, whereas novels and short stories are examples of fictional stories.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Because the line between fact and fiction can often blur, it is helpful to understand what your purpose is from the beginning. Is it important that you recount history, either your own or someone else’s? Or does your interest lie in reshaping the world in your own image—either how you would like to see it or how you imagine it could be? Your answers will go a long way in shaping the stories you tell.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, whether the story is fact or fiction, narrative writing tries to relay a series of events in an emotionally engaging way. You want your audience to be moved by your story, which could mean through laughter, sympathy, fear, anger, and so on. The more clearly you tell your story, the more emotionally engaged your audience is likely </p><br />

Option 1</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a literary work, film, or other narrative, the plot is the sequence of events where each affects the next one through the principle of cause-and-effect. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of events linked by the connector "and so". Plots can vary from the simple—such as in a traditional ballad—to forming complex interwoven structures, with each part sometimes referred to as a subplot or imbroglio.</p><p></p><br />

                            28. THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.

                            29. Taro, The Great SpiderBy Menere R. NasiadIn a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens. After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people. The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see theenormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro,The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village. The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea. “I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him.“How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked.“I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland.Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. Ayan po yung story pls po need ko na po brainliest ko agar sagot pag matino​</h2><br />
