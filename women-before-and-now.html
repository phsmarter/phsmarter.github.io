Most women prefer men who are tallerthan they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free).But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access toresources which means a short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, justlike women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of worktend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this.

 Men's looks matter to straight women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features ( a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free ). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources- which means a really short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminists journalists deforest North American publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and " Learn to love that woman in the mirror! " nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to " Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch! "
 Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money as a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, " No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly! " ( Because the road to female empowerment is... looking just like a hairy old man? )

                                            TEXT #2: The article below written by Amy Alkon will inform you on how she viewed the beauty of an individual. Read and understand the text and determine Alkon's prejudice towards how people feel about improving their physical appearance. Write an essay explaining how prejudice is evident in the text. Men's looks matter to heterosexual women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that potential is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources-which means a really short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminist journalists deforest North America publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and 7 "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!", nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having the vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money as a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, "No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly!" (Because the road to female empowerment is...looking just like a hairy old man?) pagawa namn po reporting napi kase nmin huhu gagawa lng po ng easy about that na gagawing  prejudice​</a>

                                            DIRECTIONS: in less than 75 words, summarize the given text. (10 points) As today's bride and groom celebrate their wedding, they have every excuse for being nervous. They exchange promises of lifelong fidelity and mutual support. However, all around them, they can see that many people do not and cannot keep these promises. Their own marriage has a one in three chance of divorce, if present tendencies continue. Traditional marriage is facing a crisis, at least in Britain. Not only are there more and more divorces, but the number of marriages is falling. Living together is more popular than before. The family is now no longer one man, one woman and their children. Instead, there are more and more families which include parents, half sisters and brothers, or even only one parent on her / his own. Although Britain is still conservative in its attitudes to marriage compared with other countries such as the USA, Sweden and Denmark, the future will probably see many more people living together before marriage - and more divorce. Interestingly, it is women rather than men who apply for divorce. Seven out of ten divorces are given to the wife. Also, one of the main reasons for divorce, chosen by ten times more women than men, is unreasonable or cruel behavior. Perhaps this means that women will tolerate less than they used to.​</a>

                            18. TEXT #2: The article below written by Amy Alkon will inform you on how she viewed the beauty of an individual. Read and understand the text and determine Alkon's prejudice towards how people feel about improving their physical appearance. Write an essay explaining how prejudice is evident in the text. Men's looks matter to heterosexual women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that potential is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources-which means a really short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminist journalists deforest North America publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and 7 "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!", nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having the vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money as a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, "No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly!" (Because the road to female empowerment is...looking just like a hairy old man?) pagawa namn po reporting napi kase nmin huhu gagawa lng po ng easy about that na gagawing  prejudice​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The article by Amy Alkon titled "Men's Looks Matter Less to Women Than You Think" discusses the preferences of heterosexual women when it comes to physical appearance in men. Alkon suggests that women prefer men who are taller than them with symmetrical features, indicating good health and lack of parasites. However, the author notes that women place a greater emphasis on a potential partner's status, power, and access to resources than their physical appearance. The article also highlights the challenges faced by men who have low income or are chronically unemployed in finding partners.</p><p></p><p>Prejudice is evident in the text as the author appears to hold biased views against women who do not conform to societal beauty standards. Alkon criticizes feminist journalists who encourage women to embrace their natural appearance and not participate in the "beauty arms race." She argues that advising women to "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!" is ridiculous and suggests that women need to remove their mustache or work off their beer belly to achieve empowerment. This indicates a prejudice towards women who do not conform to traditional beauty standards.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the author shows a biased attitude towards men who are chronically unemployed or make very little money. Alkon suggests that men who are in this position have a difficult time finding partners, and nobody advises them to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" This statement implies that men who are not financially successful do not deserve love or respect, which is a prejudiced view.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Amy Alkon's article exhibits prejudice towards individuals who do not conform to traditional beauty standards and those who are not financially successful. The author's opinions suggest that societal norms regarding beauty and wealth are more important than individual worth and contribute to harmful attitudes towards marginalized individuals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainlist po </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The roles of men and women now are equal unlike the past.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The roles of men and women in the past are different from the roles that we have today. Men in the past are expected to be working outside to support the family financially and mostly doesn't do housework. Men now can do housework (househusbands). Women in the past are likely to stay in the house and do all the housework. Women today are now working outside while their partners stay in the house. Men in the past are taught to be tough and not cry so they can't show any weakness unlike the men today are can cry because crying is not a weakness but are emotions. Women in the past cannot or are not allowed to be a leader because of gender inequality but women today can even become a president of a country. But whatever the reasons are, i can say that i like the roles of men and women now than their roles in the past</p><br />

                            21. DIRECTIONS: in less than 75 words, summarize the given text. (10 points) As today's bride and groom celebrate their wedding, they have every excuse for being nervous. They exchange promises of lifelong fidelity and mutual support. However, all around them, they can see that many people do not and cannot keep these promises. Their own marriage has a one in three chance of divorce, if present tendencies continue. Traditional marriage is facing a crisis, at least in Britain. Not only are there more and more divorces, but the number of marriages is falling. Living together is more popular than before. The family is now no longer one man, one woman and their children. Instead, there are more and more families which include parents, half sisters and brothers, or even only one parent on her / his own. Although Britain is still conservative in its attitudes to marriage compared with other countries such as the USA, Sweden and Denmark, the future will probably see many more people living together before marriage - and more divorce. Interestingly, it is women rather than men who apply for divorce. Seven out of ten divorces are given to the wife. Also, one of the main reasons for divorce, chosen by ten times more women than men, is unreasonable or cruel behavior. Perhaps this means that women will tolerate less than they used to.​</h2><br />

People will cue into matters that be counted to them, and disregard the matters that don’t, that can cause the “ostrich effect” (named so due to the fact ostriches bury their heads withinside the sand), wherein a topic seeks to keep away from records which could disprove their authentic point.</p><p></p>2. The Dunning-Kruger Effect. <p>This specific bias refers to how human beings understand a idea or occasion to be simplistic simply due to the fact their expertise approximately it can be easy or lacking—the much less you understand approximately something, the much less complex it can appear. However, this shape of bias limits curiosity—human beings don’t sense the want to similarly discover a idea, as it appears simplistic to them. This bias also can lead human beings to assume they're smarter than they genuinely are due to the fact they've decreased a complicated concept to a simplistic understanding.</p>3. Cultural bias. <p>Cultural bias, additionally called implicit bias, includes folks that understand different cultures as being abnormal, outlying, or exotic, absolutely primarily based totally on a assessment to their very own culture. Also called implicit social cognition, this bias attributes the trends and behaviors of an man or woman to a bigger organization of humans. Implicit bias creates attitudes or stereotypes that could have an effect on or have an impact on our selections in an subconscious way. This subconscious bias influences many humans due to the fact they may be blind to the origins in their baseline of thinking.</p>4. In-organization bias. <p>This sort of bias refers to how humans are much more likely to help or agree with a person inside their very own social organization than an outsider. This bias has a tendency to get rid of objectivity from any form of choice or hiring process, as people have a tendency to choose folks that they individually recognize and need to help.</p>5. Decline bias.<p>The decline bias refers back to the tendency to examine the beyond to the present, main to the choice that matters are worse, or turning into worse in evaluation to the beyond, absolutely due to the fact alternate is occurring.</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/16042245</p><br />
