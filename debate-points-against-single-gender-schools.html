                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic of whether gender equality will be obtained is a complex and multifaceted issue, and there are different perspectives on this topic. Some people argue that gender equality is attainable, while others believe it may be difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>One argument in favor of gender equality being obtained is that progress has already been made in many areas. Women have gained greater access to education and employment opportunities, and there are more women in positions of power and influence than ever before. Laws and policies have also been put in place to promote gender equality, and there is greater awareness and recognition of the importance of gender equality.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there are still significant challenges to achieving gender equality. Women continue to face discrimination and bias in many areas, including employment, education, and access to healthcare. Violence against women is also a pervasive problem in many parts of the world. Additionally, cultural attitudes and norms that perpetuate gender inequality are deeply ingrained and may be difficult to change.</p><br />

SPECIFIC &amp; FOCUSED</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Types of Claims</p><p>Claims usually fall into one of three types:</p><p></p><p>Claims of fact</p><p>Claims of value</p><p>Claims of policy</p><p>Claims of Fact</p><p>decorative image</p><p>A claim of fact makes an assertion about something that can be proved or disproved with factual evidence. However, keep in mind the basic quality of claims, that they have to be debatable, and offer an assertion about an issue. So a claim of fact for a logical argument cannot simply consist of a statistic or proven fact. It needs, instead, to focus on an assertion which uses facts to back it up, but for which the evidence might still be debatable.</p><p></p><p>Inappropriate claim of fact – a statistic or fact that is not debatable:</p><p></p><p>“the month of March 2017 was 1.03°C (1.9°F) above the 20th century average—this marked the first time the monthly temperature departure from average surpassed 1.0°C (1.8°F) in the absence of an El Niño episode in the tropical Pacific Ocean.” (from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration, NOAA, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201713 )</p><p></p><p>Appropriate claim of fact – makes a claim that is debatable using factual evidence</p><p></p><p>Decreasing carbon dioxide emissions from car exhaust, manufacturing processes, fertilizers, and landfills, while slowing deforestation, may help slow the process of global warming.</p><p></p><p>Claims of Value</p><p>decorative imageA claim of value argues that something is good or bad, or that one thing is better than another thing.</p><p></p><p>Sample claims of value:</p><p></p><p>It’s better to apply good nutritional choices at home than teach them at school, because good nutrition then becomes ingrained in the child’s experience.</p><p></p><p>Although immunotherapy has produced some good results in fighting cancer, overall it is less effective than chemotherapy.</p><p></p><p>Claims of Policy</p><p>decorative imageA claim of policy argues that certain conditions should exist, or that something should or should not be done, in order to solve a problem.</p><p></p><p>Sample claims of policy:</p><p></p><p>The city’s board of education should institute an honors program not only for high school students, but for elementary and junior high school students as well.</p><p></p><p>Just as smoking ads have been banned in order to decrease the urge to engage in an unhealthy behavior, soda ads should be banned for the same reason.</p><p></p><p>No matter the type of claim, you will usually combine many types of support for that claim in order to write a logical argument, including facts, case studies, reasons, personal interviews, and more, as appropriate</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>pwede </strong><strong>pabrainliest</strong><strong> answer</strong><strong> po</strong><strong> salamat</strong><strong> po</strong><strong> talaga</strong><strong> please</strong><strong> po</strong><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yf g u gyyfc</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>stama po ba sagot ko po maam</p><br />

He replied that "yes, it is true that dollar bills have a religious reference to God, but that no one really thinks much about that symbolism. It's just there." But symbols are never "just there." Symbols serve purposes, like exhibiting power and collective identity. Symbols have a historic heritage. If we review history from this religious point of view of the Constitution being a Sacred Text and even the concept of having certain people to "fund" the country (Founding Fathers), we can tell symbolism is relevant</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The team was instructed to take note of the debate against Harvard and reflect on what was different about it. Perhaps, the stakes were higher for them, and they felt the pressure of the world watching and waiting for them to fail. However, it is essential to consider how the team handles stress during the national championship.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong>During the debate against Harvard, members of the team were faced with a new level of pressure. Not only were they competing against a renowned institution, but the world was also watching. The team knew that any mistake or misstep could be scrutinized by a global audience. Despite this added stress, the team remained composed and focused on their arguments. In preparation for the national championship, the team has been implementing various stress management techniques such as meditation and exercise to ensure they are mentally and physically prepared for the competition.</p><p></p><br />

possible questions against sex change and how to defend</h2><br />
                        <p>1. "Why do transgender individuals need to change their bodies when they can just accept themselves as they are?"</p><p></p><p><strong>DEFENSE:</strong> Transgender individuals experience significant distress, known as gender dysphoria, as a result of the incongruence between their gender identity and their assigned sex at birth. Gender affirming care, including hormone therapy and surgery, can greatly alleviate this distress and improve the individual's overall well-being. Additionally, transgender individuals have the right to make choices about their own bodies and medical treatment. </p><p></p><p>2. "Isn't sex change just a form of mutilation?"</p><p></p><p><strong>DEFENSE</strong>: Transgender individuals undergo gender affirming care to align their bodies with their gender identity, not to mutilate themselves. This care is widely accepted as a safe and effective treatment for gender dysphoria, and is supported by numerous medical and mental health professional associations. Moreover, the term "mutilation" implies a negative connotation that is not applicable in this context.</p><p></p><p>3. "Why should society have to accommodate transgender individuals by changing bathrooms and other gendered spaces?"</p><p></p><p><strong>DEFENSE</strong>: Allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom and other gendered spaces that align with their gender identity is a matter of basic human rights and dignity. Denying transgender individuals this access can lead to increased discrimination and harassment, and can also have negative effects on their mental and physical health. Additionally, accommodations for transgender individuals are not burdensome and do not negatively impact non-transgender individuals.</p><p>                 It is important to remember that each individual's experience and situation is unique, and this is a complex subject. It is essential to approach it with empathy and respect for everyone's right to live authentically and with dignity.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion can be good or bad. It depends on what country we deal with it or where we are talking about it. Because if we talked about abortion here in Philippines, its no doubt a bad thing. Philippines is a very religious country that is very against about abortion for abortion is taking someone's life, it is indeed ending a baby's life inside her mom's womb. So, legalizing abortion here in Philippines will go through a very long way to go or it will never really happen.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

Gender can be the social and emotional appearance of a person and the Sex is the blood and physical appearance of the person. We know that we have just 2 Sex which is Men and Women, which means that the Gay and Tomboy are qualified in Gender. So in Gender, we have Boy and Girl, But in this situation, although the gender is really complicated we just think about the person's gender. In my opinion, there are just 2 Genders which are the male and female gender because gay is belong to the male and tomboy is belong to the female. </p><p></p><p></p>You can do It, Keep it up!<br />

it is a debate and the one we chose is the YES.</h2><br />
                        LGBTQIAA++ STUDENTS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CROSS DRESS IN SCHOOLLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students frequently face negative or hostile school climates, as well as bullying and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Negative school climates and discriminatory experiences can endanger the well-being of LGBTQ students.<strong>Dressing is a form of expression.</strong> Imagine if you are a straight man and you will be forced to wear dress (although in some cultures, men wear skirts),you will probably feel uncomfortable because it does not respond to your gender expression and sexuality. It is also the same with queer people. They will feel uncomfortable wearing clothes that does not define their expression. Some women complained that being forced to wear female clothing to class instead of male clothing upset them.Teenagers who violate school dress codes are nothing new. Teens can explore their identities and test the limits of socially acceptable behavior by experimenting with clothing, hairstyles, and even make-up. Although school officials may find dress code enforcement difficult, in the past, dress code violations were fairly common and usually revolved around prohibiting overtly sexually suggestive clothing or outward signs of gang affiliation.<p></p>CROSS-DRESSINGCross-dressing is the act of dressing as someone of a different gender. Cross-dressing has been used in modern and historical times for disguise, comfort, comedy, and self-expression.<p></p><p><strong>LGBTQ students</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2200508</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
