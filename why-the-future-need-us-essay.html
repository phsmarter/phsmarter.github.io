                                            On the LGBTQ+ Community and DiscriminationThe history of the LGBTQ+ community is complex, because society does not perceive bisexuals, gays, lesbians and transgenders as a norm. Despite the fact that according to the Declaration of Independence, “all men are created equal,” the LGBTQ+ community still has to struggle for real equality. There are various forms of LGBTQ+ discrimination. It varies from unfriendly attitude to such serious problems as the refusal to employ such an individual. As a result, many LGBTQ+ representatives are forced to live life, which they cannot control. It is obvious that discrimination is considered a permanent problem for those who belong to this community. However, its acceptance process observed during the last few years proves that the LGBTQ+ community will achieve real equality in the nearest future.It is possible to say that the LGBTQ+ community still has to struggle for its equal rights because not all people are ready to accept the fact that sexual diversity is a norm. It is also necessary to remember that things that are considered traditional in current society may become unacceptable in the future. That is why it is possible to state that the LGBTQ+ community has all chances to achieve equality in the nearest future and its members will receive an opportunity to live their life to the fullest. Different LGBTQ+ organizations do their best to bring awareness to the society about the issue of discrimination due to sexual orientation. LOGICAL ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS Directions: Rearrange correctly the sentences below to form a short argumentative essay. Use the letters A to E. _________ 1. One method that can be exercised in schools is a homosexual sensitivity training for anti-gay students and school officials. ________ 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The underlying message in his article was clear: the rate and direction of technological innovation over time will lead to a world where humans are unnecessary and machines will be able to do without us. Instead of interacting with them in the way we historically have—programming them to execute the tasks we instruct them to perform—we will cross a threshold where we unwittingly relinquish the responsibility of making important decisions that we as a society need to make. They will do our thinking for us. </p><p></p><p></p><p>We are now twenty years since the publication of his article, and we have indeed experienced tremendous technological advancement. It is well-deserved that we marvel, celebrate, and appreciate how these advancements are adding or contributing to our experience of life as human beings. With artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular, however, one could argue it is vital that we take a moment to pause and look at what is happening through the lenses of Joy’s article. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana po makatolong ito sagot</p><br />

                            7. On the LGBTQ+ Community and DiscriminationThe history of the LGBTQ+ community is complex, because society does not perceive bisexuals, gays, lesbians and transgenders as a norm. Despite the fact that according to the Declaration of Independence, “all men are created equal,” the LGBTQ+ community still has to struggle for real equality. There are various forms of LGBTQ+ discrimination. It varies from unfriendly attitude to such serious problems as the refusal to employ such an individual. As a result, many LGBTQ+ representatives are forced to live life, which they cannot control. It is obvious that discrimination is considered a permanent problem for those who belong to this community. However, its acceptance process observed during the last few years proves that the LGBTQ+ community will achieve real equality in the nearest future.It is possible to say that the LGBTQ+ community still has to struggle for its equal rights because not all people are ready to accept the fact that sexual diversity is a norm. It is also necessary to remember that things that are considered traditional in current society may become unacceptable in the future. That is why it is possible to state that the LGBTQ+ community has all chances to achieve equality in the nearest future and its members will receive an opportunity to live their life to the fullest. Different LGBTQ+ organizations do their best to bring awareness to the society about the issue of discrimination due to sexual orientation. LOGICAL ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS Directions: Rearrange correctly the sentences below to form a short argumentative essay.
