moving overseas for work. We believe social entrepreneurship can help address some
of the issues facing the Philippines at the moment.

We believe social entrepreneurship can help address some of the issues facing the Philippines at the moment. Make a stand: Who is responsible for poverty in our country, government or people? Why? Then, state your reason. Government, why?__________People, why?__________​</a>

                                            For many people, killing is accepted as a crime. Whatever form it may be, it is still a crime. How about a life that was not yet born in this world but was intentionally ceased due to some certain reasons? Is that a crime? Many say that no mother will ever harm her child or children, however many cases contradict this statement and that one includes illegal abortion. In the Philippines, which is known for being an overpopulated country, early child pregnancy is always around the corner. Especially in the dump sites where going to school is not quite a routine, many Filipino youth are more exposed to unintended pregnancy which often results in a horrific scenario that is illegal abortion. In 2008, there were 1.9 million unintended pregnancies in the Philippines, resulting in two main outcomes-unplanned births and unsafe abortions. In the Philippines, 37% of all births are either not wanted at the time of pregnancy or entirely unwanted, and 54% of all pregnancies are unintended. On average, Filipino women give birth to more children than they want, highlighting how difficult for a woman to meet her fertility desires. This is particularly striking among the poorest Filipino women, who have nearly two children more than they intend to have (Finer and Hussain, 2013). This is a major problem among young Filipino men and women of this generation. More often, they do not think of the consequences of their actions first, that is why when they commit a mistake, another serious mistake will be held without even thinking of a more severe result. Young Filipinos of this time must be educated more about unintended or early pregnancy especially illegal abortion. They must inculcate in their minds that making hasty decisions would not help in solving a problem because a problem is not solved by making another severe problem.Question:1.

                                            introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</a>

                            25. For many people, killing is accepted as a crime. Whatever form it may be, it is still a crime. How about a life that was not yet born in this world but was intentionally ceased due to some certain reasons? Is that a crime? Many say that no mother will ever harm her child or children, however many cases contradict this statement and that one includes illegal abortion. In the Philippines, which is known for being an overpopulated country, early child pregnancy is always around the corner. Especially in the dump sites where going to school is not quite a routine, many Filipino youth are more exposed to unintended pregnancy which often results in a horrific scenario that is illegal abortion. In 2008, there were 1.9 million unintended pregnancies in the Philippines, resulting in two main outcomes-unplanned births and unsafe abortions. In the Philippines, 37% of all births are either not wanted at the time of pregnancy or entirely unwanted, and 54% of all pregnancies are unintended. On average, Filipino women give birth to more children than they want, highlighting how difficult for a woman to meet her fertility desires. This is particularly striking among the poorest Filipino women, who have nearly two children more than they intend to have (Finer and Hussain, 2013). This is a major problem among young Filipino men and women of this generation. More often, they do not think of the consequences of their actions first, that is why when they commit a mistake, another serious mistake will be held without even thinking of a more severe result. Young Filipinos of this time must be educated more about unintended or early pregnancy especially illegal abortion. They must inculcate in their minds that making hasty decisions would not help in solving a problem because a problem is not solved by making another severe problem.Question:1.

                            29. introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</h2><br />
