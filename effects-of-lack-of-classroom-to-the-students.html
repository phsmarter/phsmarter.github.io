                            1. What is the effects of lack of books to students?</h2><br />
                        The scarcity of books in school, specifically to students can cause a lot of disturbance not only for the students but also to the teachers as well. Books are considered as a primary source of knowledge especially if we considered those rural public schools were learning materials are finite in numbers. Lack of book may affect the student's performance. The learning environment for the students might be affected as well. Imagine, in a certain room, there are only 20 books available and you are 50 in total. How could you able to study and have brainstorming if 3 or 4 students are shared in just 1 book? do you think that kind of ambiance will elevate their performance? <br /><br />Lack of book is also a real struggle for the teachers. they need to transfer what is in the book onto the chalkboard. instead to lessen their workload, they need to put more efforts and time. <br /><br />We can say that lack of textbooks will make the learning process much difficult and the quality of education that the students might get will be low.<br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>Slow Internet connections or limited access from homes in rural areas can contribute to students falling behind academically, according to a new report from Michigan State University's Quello Center. The educational setbacks can have significant impacts on academic success, college admissions, and career opportunities.</p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p>This study shows that the use of the Internet for study purposes and academic achievement is directly proportional to each other while inversely proportional to student social life.

According to a study released by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), bad Internet connection is a more pressing problem in the Philippines compared to poverty and corruption.</p>Hope This Answer Helps :-)Mark This Answer Into BRAINLIEST ^_^Thanks!<br />

Now that classes will be done online, it is required for students to have an internet connection. Also, they will need a device on which they are to attend their classes and pass their outputs. </p><p>This issue is also encountered in school special programs like journalism, computer sciences, and etc. Writing newspapers, editing articles, radio, and TV broadcasting will require printers, computers, microphones, and such. And so does computer programming. </p><br />

                            5. what is lacking in a homeschooling that is in the classroom setting?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Parents who want to homeschool their children but still have some reservations about it should take time to consider the positive and negative aspects of homeschooling.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps and pa brainliests po (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You might wonder if kids have to go to school. It's true that kids must be educated, but it's legal to be schooled at home. In fact, more than 1 million students do it. These kids can learn just as they do in regular school, but their parents are in charge of their education.
</p><p>
</p><p>Homeschool parents must make sure that their kids get the instruction and the experiences they need. The parents also may have to file paperwork with the state to explain who's teaching the kid and which subjects are being covered.</p><p>What Are Some Advantages?
</p><p>Kids who are homeschooled may benefit from the one-on-one attention. For instance, if you don't understand something in math, the whole class won't be moving on without you. You might be the whole class! It's also possible that you might learn more than you would in a regular classroom, because if you really excel at something, you can keep learning more at your own pace.
</p><p>
</p><p>Kids who are homeschooled also may get out in their communities more than other kids. They might get to experience hands-on education at museums, libraries, businesses, marinas, and other community resources. They also might volunteer or participate in "service learning" where they take on local projects.</p><p>What Are the Disadvantages?
</p><p>People disagree about how much formal education a person needs to be a good teacher. Not all parents and homeschool tutors have gone to school to learn to teach or to learn the subject they are teaching. If a parent is well educated, he or she may understand some subjects really well but others not as well. For instance, a kid's mom may be great at chemistry but not as good at English.
</p><p>
</p><p>To be fair, not all schoolteachers are experts in their fields either. And tutors may be used for subjects the parent isn't skilled in. If a homeschool parent or tutor doesn't know something or can't fully explain it, the instructor and student can always research the issue together. A local library, university, community college, or the Internet may have the answers.
</p><p>
</p><p>A kid who's homeschooled doesn't have the convenience of school facilities, such as a gymnasium, science lab, or art studio. The child may be taught at the kitchen table or at a "school" area in the home. He or she might do science experiments in the kitchen or go outside to work on an art project. Some parents who homeschool their kids form groups so their kids can go together to take art classes and take part in other group learning activities, like field trips.
</p><p>
</p><p>Effects on social life can be another possible disadvantage for homeschooled kids. All kids need to have friends and be around other children. Some homeschoolers may feel cut off from kids their age or feel like they spend too much time with their families.
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents who homeschool their kids often make efforts to ensure their son or daughter has a social life. For instance, groups of homeschooled children may get together regularly to learn together or just socialize. And like any child, they may be on sports teams, in dance classes, or take part in other activities outside of school.

                        <p>Here are some reasons why schools are not allowing cellphones inside the classroom and their potential effects if students do not comply:</p><p></p><p>Distraction: Cellphones can be a major distraction in the classroom. Students may be tempted to check their notifications or messages during class, which can affect their learning and performance.</p><p></p><p>Cheating: Cellphones can be used for cheating during tests or exams. Students may access online resources or messaging apps to get answers from their classmates.</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying: Cellphones can also be a tool for cyberbullying. Students may use their phones to send hurtful messages or post embarrassing photos or videos of their classmates.</p><p></p><p>Disruptive behavior: Students may use their phones to play games or watch videos during class, which can disrupt the learning environment and distract other students.</p><p></p><p>Health concerns: Some studies suggest that prolonged exposure to cellphone radiation may have negative health effects. Schools may want to limit students' exposure to radiation by prohibiting cellphone use in the classroom.</p><p></p><p>Socialization: Allowing cellphones in the classroom may discourage face-to-face interaction between students and teachers. Students may be more focused on their phones than on their peers or instructors, which can lead to a lack of socialization and communication skills.</p><p></p><p>Effects of non-compliance:</p><p></p><p>Lower grades: Students who are easily distracted by their phones may have lower grades and struggle to keep up with the class.</p><p></p><p>Punishments: Schools may impose penalties or punishments for students who do not comply with the cellphone policy, such as detention, suspension, or confiscation of the device.</p><p></p><p>Negative impact on learning: Students who are constantly on their phones during class may miss important information or instructions, leading to a negative impact on their learning and performance.</p><p></p><p>Safety concerns: Allowing cellphones in the classroom may pose safety concerns, as students may use their phones to access inappropriate content or engage in unsafe behaviors.</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying and harassment: Students who use their phones to engage in cyberbullying or harassment may face disciplinary action or legal consequences.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Having a lack of self-confidence can have a significant impact on the academic performance of a student. When a student lacks self-confidence, they may doubt their abilities and be hesitant to participate in class. This can lead to missed opportunities to learn and contribute to class discussions. Additionally, a lack of confidence can result in poor time management and procrastination, as the student may feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to approach assignments or exams. This can lead to low grades and a lack of motivation to improve. It's important for students to develop self-confidence through positive self-talk, setting achievable goals, and seeking support from teachers or counselors when needed. By building self-confidence, students can improve their academic performance and overall well-being.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&lt;333</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Lack of self-confidence can have a significant impact on the academic performance of grade 10 students. Self-confidence is an important factor that influences how students approach their studies, interact with their peers, and engage with their teachers. When students lack self-confidence, they may struggle to participate in class discussions, ask questions, and seek help when they need it. This can lead to a lack of engagement with the material, which can ultimately result in poor academic performance.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, a lack of self-confidence can lead to negative self-talk and feelings of inadequacy, which can create a self-fulfilling prophecy where the student begins to believe that they are not capable of succeeding academically. This can lead to a cycle of negative thoughts and behaviors that can be difficult to break.</p><p></p><p>In addition, a lack of self-confidence can also affect the student's social interactions, which can further impact their academic performance. Students who lack self-confidence may struggle to form positive relationships with their peers and may avoid participating in group work or other collaborative activities.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the lack of self-confidence can significantly impact the academic performance of grade 10 students, and it is important for educators and parents to be aware of this issue and take steps to support students in building their self-confidence.</p><p></p>Answered by AI<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Here are three possible solutions for the problem of lack of classrooms:</p><p></p>Construct additional classrooms - This solution involves building new classrooms to accommodate the increasing number of students. The construction of new classrooms can be done by the school administration, government agencies, or through public-private partnerships. The availability of funds and suitable space for construction are critical factors that need to be considered.Implement staggered class schedules - This solution involves dividing the students into groups and having them attend classes at different times of the day. For instance, the first group may attend classes from 7:00 am to 12:00 pm, while the second group attends from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm. This will allow more students to use the available classrooms without overcrowding.Utilize technology for remote learning - This solution involves using technology to deliver classes to students who are not physically present in the classroom. This can be done through online classes, video conferencing, or other technological tools that allow students to learn from home. This solution may require the school to provide devices and internet connectivity to students who may not have access to these resources.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are several potential solutions to address the issue of a lack of classrooms:</p><p></p><p>1. Create a staggered schedule: One option could be to divide the students into multiple groups and stagger their schedules so that each group attends school at different times of the day or week. This would require fewer classrooms at any given time, allowing schools to accommodate more students with limited resources.</p><p></p><p>2. Utilize alternative learning spaces: Schools could consider utilizing alternative learning spaces such as libraries, gymnasiums, or even outdoor spaces for classes. This would require some creativity and flexibility from teachers and students, but it could help alleviate the space constraints.</p><p></p><p>3. Utilize technology: Another option is to use technology to provide remote learning opportunities. This could involve setting up virtual classrooms, utilizing video conferencing software, or providing access to online resources and materials. While this solution may not work for all students, it could help free up physical space in the classroom for those who need it most.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the best solution will depend on the specific circumstances and resources available to each school. It may be necessary to combine multiple approaches or develop new strategies to effectively address the issue of a lack of classrooms.</p><br />
