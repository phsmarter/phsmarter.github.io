                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>CHARACTERIZATION:</p><p>The main characters of the story are Andy, his sister, Martha, their parents, and Mr. and Mrs. MacIver. Andy and Martha are siblings who recently moved to a new house with their parents. Mr. and Mrs. MacIver are the previous owners of the house and have now moved to a nursing home. The ghost of the previous owner of the house, Mr. MacIver, also plays a significant role in the story. The characters are related to each other as neighbors and previous owners of the house.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I can relate to Andy as a curious and adventurous young boy who is interested in discovering the truth behind the mysterious events happening in the house.</p><p></p><p>SETTING:</p><p>The story takes place in a small town in the countryside of America. The house where Andy and his family moved in is an old and creepy house located in Windy Hill. The setting is effective in visualizing the scenes as the descriptions of the house and the surrounding area create a spooky and eerie atmosphere. For example, the description of the house having "shadows on its roof, like the fingers of some giant hand" creates a vivid image in the reader's mind.</p><p></p><p>PLOT:</p><p>The story begins with Andy and his family moving into a new house in Windy Hill. Soon, Andy begins to notice strange events happening in the house, such as doors opening and closing on their own, and footsteps heard when no one is around. Andy becomes curious and starts investigating the history of the house, and with the help of Mr. MacIver's ghost, discovers that there is a hidden treasure in the house. The story ends with Andy finding the treasure, which turns out to be a valuable painting.</p><p></p><p>There are unexpected twists and turns in the story, such as the discovery of Mr. MacIver's ghost, and the revelation of the hidden treasure.</p><p></p><p>CONFLICT:</p><p>The main problem in the story is the mystery behind the strange events happening in the house, which Andy is determined to solve. The conflict is clear and realistic, as it involves a common theme of curiosity and discovery. It is something that people may experience in real life when moving into a new house with a mysterious history.</p><p></p><p>STYLE:</p><p>The author's writing style is distinctive in creating a spooky and mysterious atmosphere through vivid descriptions of the house and its surroundings. The author also uses simple and straightforward language, making it an easy read for young readers.</p><br />

                            7. The narrator in the story Entitled The Diamond Necklace mentioned in this commentary: "How small a thing is needed to make or ruin us! How true can this line be in real life situations? Cite a concrete example.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>It is certainly true that small things can have a big impact on our lives. One example of this is the concept of the "butterfly effect," which refers to the idea that a small change in one part of a system can lead to significant changes in other parts of the system. In other words, a small event or decision can have far-reaching consequences.</p><p></p><p>For example, consider the story of the "Diamond Necklace." In this story, a small mistake or misjudgment, such as losing a valuable piece of jewelry, can have serious consequences, such as financial ruin or social disgrace. In real life, a small event or decision can also have significant consequences. For example, failing to pay a small bill on time could lead to late fees and damaged credit, which could have long-term consequences on one's financial stability and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Overall, it is important to be mindful of the potential impact of small things and to carefully consider the consequences of our actions and decisions.</p><p></p><br />
