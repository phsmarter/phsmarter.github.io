To create a Pareto diagram, the operator collects random data, regroups the categories and creates abased on the results. (table, chart, bar graph, line graph)3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Quality management is the process for ensuring that all project activities necessary to design, plan and implement a project are effective and efficient with respect to the purpose of the objective and its performance. ... A product may be of good quality (no defects) and be of low grade (few or no extra features).</p><p>2.A Pareto chart is a basic quality tool that helps you identify the most frequent defects, complaints, or any other factor you can count and categorize. ... A Pareto chart is just a bar chart that arranges the bars (counts) from largest to smallest, from left to right</p><p>3.Low cost can result from high productivity and high capacity utilization. More importantly, improvements in quality lead to improvements in productivity, which in turn lead to lower costs. Thus a strategy of continuous improvement is essential to achieve a low-cost competitive advantage [6-8].</p><p>4.: Scatter diagram. Also called: scatter plot, X-Y graph. The scatter diagram graphs pairs of numerical data, with one variable on each axis, to look for a relationship between them. If the variables are correlated, the points will fall along a line or curve.</p><p>5.The purposeful change of a process to improve the confidence or reliability of the outcome.</p><br />
