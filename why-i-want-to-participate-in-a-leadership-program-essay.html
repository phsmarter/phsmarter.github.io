                            1. Do you still believe in Pres Duterte and his programs of his leadership? Why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Within weeks of his inauguration as president of the Philippines in June 2016, Rodrigo R. Duterte became the most internationally known Filipino leader since Ferdinand Marcos, the country’s infamous dictator, and Corazon Aquino, the iconic housewife-turned-president who championed the restoration of democracy in 1986. A great deal of media attention has been paid to Duterte’s murderous war on drugs as well as to his often crass and controversial statements. His embrace of China and his visceral disdain for the United States has garnered additional attention in foreign policy circles, and he frequently is included in media reports and scholarly articles on the rise of populism globally.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>ba brainliest</p><p>#carryonlearning</p><p></p><br />

Writing your own eulogy is a simple technique to help you define your leadership legacy.</p><p></p><p>Reflect on the questions, above.

A well written eulogy clarifies the leadership legacy that you want to build. Think of the eulogy as a living document, not just a one-off exercise. Start it, reflect, come back to it. Work on it over time and it can become a profound expression of everything that you want to achieve. Having this clarity has enormous benefits.</p><p></p><p>Motivation. With clarity comes motivation. Once you’ve clearly articulated the legacy that you want to create, you’ll be more motivated to deliver it.</p><p></p><p>Decision making. There are plenty of times you must make tough decisions as a leader. A well-written leadership legacy helps to guide your decision-making. You’re clearer about what’s important to you and that will guide and inform your decisions.</p><p></p><p>Development. The eulogy also becomes a benchmark against which you can evaluate your performance. Where are you already delivering? How do you need to improve? These kinds of considerations feed into your development planning and make sure that your investment in development is focused and pays off.</p><p></p><p>Charting your career path. Finally, a eulogy can help guide your career. Reflect on what you want people to say about you at the end of your career, it’s a useful way of exploring your career goals.</p><p></p><p>Align your day-to-day with your desired leadership legacy</p><p>Ultimately, your eulogy defines the leadership legacy you want to build and it becomes your guide.</p><p></p><p>You must make sure that your day-to-day behaviors are aligned to the outcomes you’ve defined.</p><p></p><p>There are three powerful techniques to help you do this:</p><p></p><p>Seek feedback.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>-   Leadership is the art of motivating a group of people to act toward achieving a common goal. In a business setting, this can mean directing workers and colleagues with a strategy to meet the company's needs. It doesn't matter who's the boss, but how you treat your companions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> giving you 44 words(I guess)</p>Leadership is an innate quality as well as it can also be learned. If one is willing to be a good leader then he or she should really make up his or her mind and practice all the qualities of a good leader because everything costs hard work and dedication, without it nothing can be achieved. To be a successful leader, you have to be able to convince your followers, not just yourself or your superiors, that you are worthy of being followed. In my opinion, this can build confidence in their followers to have faith in you, in order to be able to lead. I strongly believe that good leaders are made rather, and not born. If you have the desire and willpower, you can become an effective leader. <br />

Effective leadership helps individuals and groups to achieve their goals and aspirations, and it creates a sense of direction and purpose that drives progress and growth.</p><p></p><p>One of the key roles of a leader is to inspire and motivate their followers.

In addition, a good leader can inspire their team members to embrace change and be more adaptable, which can be critical in a fast-paced and ever-changing world.</p><p></p><p>Finally, leadership plays an essential role in creating a positive work culture. A good leader understands the importance of building strong relationships with their team members, promoting a positive attitude, and fostering a sense of collaboration and teamwork. Leaders who create a positive work culture can attract and retain top talent, increase productivity, and improve employee satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, leadership is a critical component of success in all areas of life. Effective leadership can inspire, motivate, and guide individuals and groups towards their goals and aspirations. Leaders who can make sound decisions, promote innovation and change, and create a positive work culture can drive progress and create positive change.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In today’s fitness industry, each manager is confronted with a unique set of challenges every day. Since the fitness industry is a service industry, managers are challenged with making difficult decisions that are in the best interest of the organization, while simultaneously operating as effective leaders by meeting the needs of its people and clients.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Much energy, time and effort is dedicated to developing and maintaining systems and tasks that allow the machinery of the organization to run smoothly. It is understandable for the manager to prioritize his or her time and energy on these systems since these enable the organization to continue to make money.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>On the flip side, each system within an organization is run and maintained by people. Disregarding the needs of the people, one can expect a very high turnover of employees and decreased work motivation of trainers. This in turn affects client satisfaction resulting in a drop of membership numbers, and therefore a decrease in revenue. Achieving an effective balance between management and leadership is an extremely complex task.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
