                                            11- PERFORMANCE TASK A. Module 1: Argumentative Essay Direction: From the argumentative essay below, identify its parts by rewriting the important information in the box. The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Stress can play a part in problems such as headaches, high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, skin conditions, asthma, arthritis, depression, and anxiety. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) declared stress a hazard of the workplaceStress that's left unchecked can contribute to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and diabetes.Under stress, your heart also pumps faster. Stress hormones cause your blood vessels to constrict and divert more oxygen to your muscles so you'll have more strength to take action. But this also raises your blood pressure. As a result, frequent or chronic stress will make your heart work too hard for too long.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Stress and Health: Understanding the Connection</p><p></p><p>Stress is an inevitable part of life. It is a natural response to the demands of daily living, such as work, relationships, and financial challenges. Although stress can be motivating and help people achieve their goals, it can also have negative effects on physical and mental health.</p><p></p><p>Stress affects the body in several ways. It activates the “fight or flight” response, which causes the release of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones increase heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, which prepare the body to respond to a perceived threat. When stress is chronic, however, it can cause long-term damage to the body’s systems, including the cardiovascular, immune, and digestive systems.</p><p></p><p>Chronic stress has been linked to several health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Stress can also worsen existing conditions such as asthma and arthritis. Additionally, stress can have a negative impact on mental health, leading to depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.</p><p></p><p>To manage stress and promote good health, it is important to adopt healthy coping strategies. Exercise, relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep breathing, and social support are effective ways to reduce stress. In addition, getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding drugs and alcohol can also help manage stress and promote overall health.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, stress is an unavoidable part of life that can have both positive and negative effects on health. By adopting healthy coping strategies and taking care of the body, individuals can manage stress and promote good health. Understanding the connection between stress and health is an important step in achieving a balanced and healthy lifestyle.</p><br />

The Whales and Dolphins There is no doubt that marine mammals should not be held in captivity. They are part of nature and should not be bought, sold, or thrown in an aquarium. Marine mammals have the right to be kept in their natural environment. Captivity causes many health problems in marine mammals. Many tanks have water full of chemicals and bacteria; this results to blindness and many skin problems in dolphins and other marine mammals. Marine mammals in captivity die from pneumonia, ulcers, and other stress-related diseases. Most of these helpless creatures suffer from boredom. Dolphins in wild can swim up to 40-100 miles per day, but in pools they go around swimming repetitive patterns. Due to boredom and limited space, many dolphins abuse themselves; they often bang their heads against tank and aquarium walls. In addition, some of these poor innocent creatures face abusive treatment by their caretakers; thus, shortening their life span. In fact, Keiko, the killer whale star of Free Willy, was a victim of this type of abuse. It was known to be said that he was 1000 pounds underweight and developed a wartlike disease. His teeth were ground down chewing the sides of the pool due to boredom, and he also had a problem with his dorsal fin. mam st Marine mammals also breed very poorly in captivity with very high infant death rates. For this reason, when a baby dolphin is born into captivity, its birth is usually kept a secret from its mother until it shows signs of survival. Marine do breed in captivity, but the birth rate in captivity is not as successful as in the wild. On the contrary, some people think that holding animals in captivity helps in study and research. But the truth is, scientists prefer to learn about animals in their natural environment, so they get firsthand knowledge. In conclusion, marine mammals should definitely not be held in captivity. Mahatma Ghandi once said, "The greatness of nation and its moral process can be measured by the way its animals are treated." In a world where much of nature and the wild has already been lost, it is up to us to let these beautiful marine mammals free.

Ultimately, the key to promoting good mental health is to engage in a variety of activities and practices that foster physical, emotional, and social well-being.</p><p></p><p>Stress is a normal and inevitable part of life, and it is often a natural response to challenging situations. In fact, some degree of stress can be beneficial, as it can help us stay alert, focused, and motivated. However, chronic or excessive stress can have negative impacts on both our physical and mental health. It is important to recognize when stress has become excessive or unmanageable, and to take steps to reduce its impact on our lives. Effective stress management techniques can include exercise, meditation, relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends or family members. By recognizing the normalcy of stress, we can work to manage it more effectively and maintain our mental and physical health.</p><br />

</p><p>In the formidable years, this had no specific theme planned. The main aim was to promote and advocate the public on important issues. Also, in the first three years, one of the central activities done to help the day become special was the 2-hour telecast by the US information agency satellite system.  </p><p>
Mental health is not just a concept that refers to an individual’s psychological and emotional well-being. Rather it’s a state of psychological and emotional well-being where an individual is able to use their cognitive and emotional capabilities, meet the ordinary demand and functions in society. According to WHO, there is no single ‘official’ definition of mental health.
</p><p>
Thus, there are many factors like cultural differences, competing professional theories, and subjective assessments that affect how mental health is defined. Also, there are many experts that agree that mental illness and mental health are not antonyms. So, in other words, when the recognized mental disorder is absent, it is not necessarily a sign of mental health. </p><p>One way to think about mental health is to look at how effectively and successfully does a person acts. So, there are factors such as feeling competent, capable, able to handle the normal stress levels, maintaining satisfying relationships and also leading an independent life. Also, this includes recovering from difficult situations and being able to bounce back.  </p><br />
