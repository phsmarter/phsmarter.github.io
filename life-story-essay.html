                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This is what I firmly believe in. But this is not about our love story, this is about travel and love stories. I totally understand that there are perks of travelling solo. But there are a few of our tribe who loves travelling together with their partners, enjoying the life on the road. This blog is all about travel love stories.</p><p></p><p>These days it is difficult to find someone who has the same interest as you. So if you can actually find someone who is as crazy as you to live a life on the road and accept you as you are, there is nothing like it.</p><p></p><p>For my part, I was always the wild and crazy girl who would do things that she was told not to do. I always loved to wander around and climb mountains. And I was sure that I would probably not get someone in this life who would understand my zeal to explore the unknown, to be on the road and be attracted to all the oddities of life that others run away from. Until one day, Agni came barging right into my class and later into my life. We were like chalk and cheese. We still are. Yet love found us.</p><p></p><p>For most in the list, travel brought them together. But it was not so in our case. Agni was not so fond of travelling, but he too had the same enthusiasm to explore the unknown and do all that others might not want to venture into. While we discovered the adventures of life together, we also discovered the joys of travelling together. And today we travel together with wonder and abandon.</p><p></p><p>Love and travel bind us together. And I am sure all the couples who travel together!</p><p></p><p>Here is a list of … such couples who have shared their travel love stories. And yes, every love story is special, but ours is my favourite!</p><p></p><p>Travel Love Stories</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>plssssss brainliest</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student, I have faced many challenges throughout my academic journey. From struggling with difficult coursework to dealing with personal issues, I have learned that life as a student can be challenging at times. However, I have also learned that it is possible to overcome these challenges and come out stronger for it.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest challenges I have faced as a student was when I was taking a particularly difficult math class. The material was complex and I found myself struggling to understand the concepts. I spent countless hours studying and trying to grasp the material, but nothing seemed to click. I felt defeated and was ready to give up.</p><p></p><p>But I didn't give up, instead I sought help. I went to my professor's office hours and asked for extra help. I also formed a study group with my classmates and we helped each other to understand the material. I also found a tutor who helped me to work through the problems in a way that made sense to me.</p><p></p><p>Through hard work and determination, I was able to improve my understanding of the material and even ended up getting a good grade in the class. That experience taught me that it's okay to struggle and ask for help when you need it.</p><p></p><p>Another challenge I faced as a student was dealing with personal issues. I was going through a difficult time in my life and found it hard to focus on my studies. I was constantly feeling down and unmotivated. But I realized that I needed to take care of myself in order to be able to succeed as a student. I sought support from friends and family, and I also made an effort to take care of my mental and physical health.</p><p></p><p>Through it all, I learned that challenges are a part of life, and that it is how we deal with them that makes the difference. I learned that I can overcome any obstacle if I am willing to put in the work and ask for help when I need it.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, as a student, I have faced many challenges, but I have also learned valuable lessons that have helped me to become a stronger and more resilient person. I know that there will be more challenges in the future, but I am confident that I have the tools to overcome them and succeed in my academic journey.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In life, we all face personal challenges that can be difficult to overcome. For me, one of the biggest challenges I've had to face is anxiety. It's something that I've struggled with for years and it's something that can be really tough to deal with on a daily basis. However, I'm slowly learning how to manage my anxiety and I'm hopeful that I'll be able to overcome it completely one day.</p><p></p><p>The character of Jean Valjean in "Les Miserables" also faces some difficult challenges. He's been imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and, when he's finally released, he finds it very difficult to start a new life. He's constantly pursued by the police inspector Javert and he's also struggling to overcome his own personal demons. However, Valjean is a strong character and he eventually manages to overcome all of the challenges he faces.</p><br />

                            24. Write an essay relating a real life situation to the story of romeo and juliet pointing out that the said story will not give the youth of today a better future. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the opening Prologue of Romeo and Juliet, the Chorus refers to the title characters as “star-crossed lovers,” an allusion to the belief that stars and planets have the power to control events on Earth. This line leads many readers to believe that Romeo and Juliet are inescapably destined to fall in love and equally destined to have that love destroyed. However, though Shakespeare’s play raises the possibility that some impersonal, supernatural force shapes Romeo and Juliet’s lives, by the end of the play it becomes clear that the characters bear more of the responsibility than Fortune does.</p><p>Though the Prologue offers the first and perhaps most famous example of celestial imagery in Romeo and Juliet, references to the stars, sun, moon, and heavens run throughout the play, and taken as a whole that imagery seems to express a different view of human responsibility. In Act 1, scene 4, Romeo says that he fears “some consequence yet hanging in the stars” when he and his gang approach the Capulet’s ball. In his next mention of stars, however, Romeo doesn’t refer to their astrological power. Rather, he uses the image of stars to describe Juliet’s otherworldly beauty. Most of the subsequent celestial images in the play follow in this vein, from Romeo’s love-struck comparison of Juliet to the sun to Juliet’s own wish to “cut [Romeo] out into little stars” when he dies. Throughout the play, these astral images are more often associated with the two lovers than with divine fate, emphasizing that, as the play’s action escalates, we cannot simply place the blame for the tragedy on some impersonal external force.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The short story "The All-American Slurp" by Lensey Namioka portrays the life of a Chinese family who moves to America and experiences cultural differences while attending a dinner party with their American neighbors. The story highlights the clash between the traditional Chinese values and the American way of life. Through the various characters in the story, the author depicts the traditions of both the Chinese and American people.</p><p></p><p>The Chinese family, consisting of the parents and their two children, are portrayed as being very traditional in their beliefs and practices. They follow the customs and traditions of their Chinese heritage, such as wearing traditional clothing, using chopsticks to eat, and respecting their elders. The father, in particular, is shown to be very traditional, as he insists on wearing his Chinese tunic and trousers to the dinner party, despite his wife's protests. The mother also upholds traditional values, as she makes sure that her family is always respectful and polite, and she insists on bringing a gift to the host of the dinner party.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the American family is portrayed as being more casual and laid-back in their approach to life. They are shown to be more interested in having fun and enjoying themselves, rather than adhering to strict customs and traditions. The mother is depicted as being friendly and outgoing, and she is eager to welcome the Chinese family into her home. The father is portrayed as being more interested in American football than anything else, and he is somewhat oblivious to the cultural differences between his family and their Chinese guests.</p><p></p><p>The clash between these two cultures is shown through the various interactions between the characters. For example, when the Chinese family arrives at the dinner party, they are initially confused by the American-style buffet and the use of paper plates and plastic utensils. They are also uncomfortable with the loud music and the casual dress of the other guests. The Americans, on the other hand, are intrigued by the Chinese family's traditional clothing and customs, but they are somewhat taken aback by their formal manners and their use of chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>Despite these differences, however, the two families manage to find common ground and enjoy each other's company. They bond over their shared love of food, and they are able to laugh and joke together despite the language barrier. The Chinese family even manages to impress the Americans with their mastery of the "slurping" technique for eating soup, which they consider a sign of good manners.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "The All-American Slurp" depicts the clash between traditional Chinese values and American culture, as seen through the interactions between the two families in the story. The author uses various characters to highlight the different customs and traditions of the two cultures, and to show how they can sometimes clash but also find common ground. Ultimately, the story emphasizes the importance of respecting and learning from other cultures, even if they are very different from our own.</p><br />
