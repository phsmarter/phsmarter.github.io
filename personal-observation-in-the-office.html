CHED: Vaccination 'additional level of safety' for limited face-to-face classes Arra Perez, ABS-CBN News Posted at Jun 24,2021 03:38 PM MANILA Although vaccination against COVID-19 is not a requirement for the conduct of limited face-to-face classes, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) looks at this as an "additional level of safety that will facilitate" it. In a press conference Thursday, CHED Chairman Prospero "Popoy" De Vera said this is one of their observations on the higher education institutions (HEIS) that have been allowed to conduct limited in-person classes. "Kasi iyong first batch, kahit na hindi required iyong vaccination para mag-limited face-to-face, ang nangyari, nabakunahan iyong mga estudyante at teacher because they were classified as frontline healthworkers," said De Vera. "So, in this next batch, we are hoping that the vaccination rollout will be faster so we will add another level of safety at the school level." As of June 21, the commission has approved the conduct of limited face-to-face classes for medicine and allied courses in 93 HEIs nationwide. De Vera said they are still collating data from these schools, but preliminary data show there were no COVID transmissions at the University of the Philippines-Manila and Our Lady of Fatima University in Valenzuela. Transmissions have been recorded in some regions, so face-to-face classes were suspended until the school is cleared by the CHED regional office and the local government to resume.​</a>

                                            What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

CHED: Vaccination 'additional level of safety' for limited face-to-face classes Arra Perez, ABS-CBN News Posted at Jun 24,2021 03:38 PM MANILA Although vaccination against COVID-19 is not a requirement for the conduct of limited face-to-face classes, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) looks at this as an "additional level of safety that will facilitate" it. In a press conference Thursday, CHED Chairman Prospero "Popoy" De Vera said this is one of their observations on the higher education institutions (HEIS) that have been allowed to conduct limited in-person classes. "Kasi iyong first batch, kahit na hindi required iyong vaccination para mag-limited face-to-face, ang nangyari, nabakunahan iyong mga estudyante at teacher because they were classified as frontline healthworkers," said De Vera. "So, in this next batch, we are hoping that the vaccination rollout will be faster so we will add another level of safety at the school level." As of June 21, the commission has approved the conduct of limited face-to-face classes for medicine and allied courses in 93 HEIs nationwide. De Vera said they are still collating data from these schools, but preliminary data show there were no COVID transmissions at the University of the Philippines-Manila and Our Lady of Fatima University in Valenzuela. Transmissions have been recorded in some regions, so face-to-face classes were suspended until the school is cleared by the CHED regional office and the local government to resume.​</h2><br />

                            29. What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.
