                                            10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as “Hunters”. However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I’m someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the “World’s ”. Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the  Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!​</a>

                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone.

With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness.

                            8. 10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as “Hunters”. However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I’m someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the “World’s ”. Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the  Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!​</h2><br />

                            21. liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</h2><br />
