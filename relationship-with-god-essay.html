                                            Origins of the English Language 1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times. 2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the Saxons, into Great Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday). 3) Then we must comprehend or understand how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles and the Saxons and made them slaves. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is pork, but the animal itself is known as a pig. 4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced all the way back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”. 5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

                                            An Ideal Citizen 1. A citizen is a person who lives in a state and is governed by its laws in all matters. An ideal citizen is an asset to a nation. Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.

Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

                            7. Origins of the English Language 1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times. 2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the Saxons, into Great Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday). 3) Then we must comprehend or understand how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles and the Saxons and made them slaves. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is pork, but the animal itself is known as a pig. 4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced all the way back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”. 5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

                            9. An Ideal Citizen 1. A citizen is a person who lives in a state and is governed by its laws in all matters. An ideal citizen is an asset to a nation. Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?

Read the following example of a definition paragraph: 
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality.
