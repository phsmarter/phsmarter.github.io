                        <strong>HERE </strong><strong>ARE</strong><strong> THE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ANSWER;</strong><p></p><p></p><p>Women have made significant progress in terms of social, political, and economic equality over the past several decades. However, there are still many issues that disproportionately affect women and girls, and it is important to address these issues in order to achieve true gender equality.</p><p></p><p>One of the major issues facing women today is the gender pay gap. Despite the fact that women make up a significant proportion of the workforce, they are often paid less than men for doing the same job. This is not only unfair, but it also has long-term financial consequences for women and their families. Closing the gender pay gap is crucial for achieving economic equality for women.</p><p></p><p>Another issue that disproportionately affects women is violence and discrimination. Women and girls are more likely to be victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and other forms of violence. In addition, women often face discrimination based on their gender, including in the workplace and in educational settings. It is important to address these issues in order to create a safer and more equal society for women.</p><p></p><p>Finally, reproductive rights are a key issue for women. This includes the right to access safe and legal abortion services, as well as the right to make decisions about their own reproductive health. Ensuring that women have access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare is essential for their physical and mental well-being, as well as their overall autonomy and equality.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while progress has been made, there is still much work to be done in order to achieve gender equality for women. It is important to continue to address these issues and work towards creating a more equitable and just society for all.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>MARK </strong><strong>AS </strong><strong>BRAINLIEST</strong><strong>.</strong><br />

                        Throughout history, women have played an essential role in shaping society. Their contributions, whether big or small, have made a significant impact on various fields and have helped shape the world we live in today. Despite this, women have often been overlooked, undervalued, and underappreciated in different aspects of their lives. Thus, it is essential to recognize and appreciate the value and worth of women in our society.<br /><br />Firstly, women have contributed significantly to various fields, such as science, politics, and the arts. Women like Marie Curie, Rosalind Franklin, and Ada Lovelace made remarkable scientific discoveries that have revolutionized the world of science. In the field of politics, women like Indira Gandhi, Angela Merkel, and Jacinda Ardern have made a significant impact in their respective countries and have inspired many other women to pursue leadership positions. Women artists like Frida Kahlo, Mary Cassatt, and Georgia O’Keeffe have also made an indelible mark in the art world, paving the way for future generations of women artists.<br /><br />Secondly, women have made significant contributions to society as a whole. Women have taken on various roles such as caregivers, teachers, and healthcare workers, and have made a significant impact in the lives of the people they have touched. Women have also been at the forefront of various social movements, fighting for equal rights, and advocating for justice and equality. Women like Gloria Steinem, Malala Yousafzai, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have inspired generations with their relentless pursuit of equal rights and social justice.<br /><br />Despite these remarkable contributions, women have often faced discrimination, gender bias, and sexism. Women have been subjected to unequal pay, unequal access to opportunities, and unequal treatment in different areas of their lives. This is why it is essential to appreciate and recognize the value of women in our society, to fight against the gender stereotypes that have kept women down and to advocate for gender equality in all aspects of our lives.<br /><br />In conclusion, women have made significant contributions to society, and their value and worth cannot be overstated. It is essential to recognize and appreciate the contributions of women in various fields, from science to the arts, and to acknowledge their crucial roles in society as caregivers, advocates, and agents of social change. Let us work together to create a world where women are valued, appreciated, and treated with respect and dignity they deserve<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>International Women's Day is celebrated on the 8th of March every year. This day is dedicated to honoring women's achievements and advocating for women's rights. It is a day for reflecting on the progress made towards gender equality and the work that still needs to be done to achieve true gender parity.</p><p>The origins of International Women's Day date back to the early 1900s. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding better pay, shorter working hours, and the right to vote. The following year, the first National Women's Day was celebrated in the United States on the 28th of February. In 1910, a conference of women from 17 countries took place in Copenhagen, Denmark. The conference led to the establishment of International Women's Day on the 8th of March.</p><p>International Women's Day has become a global day of celebration, recognizing women's achievements in politics, business, education, and other fields. It is also a day for highlighting the challenges that women still face in achieving gender equality.</p><p>One of the most significant challenges facing women today is the gender pay gap. In many countries, women earn less than men for doing the same work. This is a form of discrimination that prevents women from reaching their full potential and contributing fully to society.</p><p>Violence against women is another significant issue that needs to be addressed. Women around the world face physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and this can have long-lasting effects on their physical and mental health.</p><p>Women's health is also an important issue. Women face unique health challenges, and they often have limited access to healthcare. This can result in higher rates of maternal mortality, as well as other health issues such as breast and cervical cancer.</p><p>To address these issues, governments, NGOs, and individuals must work together to promote gender equality and women's rights. This includes implementing policies that promote equal pay for equal work, providing access to education and healthcare, and working to eliminate violence against women.</p><p>International Women's Day is an opportunity to celebrate the progress that has been made towards gender equality and to reflect on the work that still needs to be done. It is a day for honoring the achievements of women and for advocating for their rights. By working together, we can create a world where women have the same opportunities as men and where gender equality is a reality.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p>Body shaming, defined as an inappropriate negative statement and attitudes towards another person weight or size.  It can also reach into discrimination against individuals who may be overweight.  There are negative attitudes and stereotypes in the media and elsewhere towards plus size people.  A backlash against body shaming has resulted in the coming of the term itself in attempts to bring a more positive attitude toward diverse body size and styles (Bodyshaming.org 2012).  There are many people out there working towards putting an end to body shaming as well as the stereotype that goes along with being plus size.  Body shaming is wrong and needs to stop.</p><p>Have you ever heard, or said to yourself, I’m too fat I’m chunky I’m obese I wish I was thinner if only I were smaller, then you have practiced what is known as body shaming, and you’re not alone.  Many things influence this negative image that some have of their body. Body image and self-esteem go hand in hand.  Body image includes how we perceive our bodies visually how we feel about our physical appearance how we think and talk to ourselves about our bodies our sense of how other people view our bodies our sense of our bodies in physical space and our level of connectedness to our bodies. Feeling ashamed about your body is what many people seen as overweight struggle with.  Poor body image increases the risks for extreme weight control behaviors such as extreme dieting exercise compulsion laxative abuse vomiting smoking and the use of non-FDA approved dieting pills. Many people are embracing their body no matter what the scale says.  They are going to extremes to show the positive side of being plus size. Extensive levels of body-shaming can have negative emotional effects, including a reduction in self-esteem and other issues such as eating disorders, anxiety, body dysmorphia and depression. Also, body shaming can lead to serious depression, especially when people feel their body can not meet social criteria.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> There is long history of women rights in the world. There is women discrimination from a long time ago. It has been developed for a long time, but there are still discrimination against women. I think many women are still distressed by discrimination. How have women’s rights changed?
</p><p>
</p><p>            Between 1848 and 1920, there was firstwomen’s rights movement in the U.S. At that time, women did not have the right to vote. Thus, women could not help to make society or law. They did not have any voice. Many women joined the first women rights movement to get the right to vote. The women picketed in front of the White House to pressure the president. It took a very long time and many women were arrested because of picketing. Finally, women got the right to vote.
</p><p>
</p><p>            A long time ago, women could not work outside because of the law. Women had to stay home and do housework. The book written by Betty Friedan showed women’s real feelings. Many women were not happy about their lives, and they wanted choice and freedom. Then, the second women’s rights movement occurred. Finally, women got a choice to work outside or stay home.
</p><p>
</p><p>            Today, there are still problems for women. One of the big problems is sexual harassment. Many women have jobs outside, and they get sexual harassment by their bosses. It is a very common problem, and it is the worst problem for women. Also, there is unfair payment between men and women. Many women work with men, they work the same time as men, and they have the same abilities as men. However, there salaries are different. Men get more than women sometimes. It is not fair. Before, men worked for supporting their families, but now, women work for supporting their families too. Thus, it must be same amount of payment.
</p><p>
</p><p>            In conclusion, women’s rights have become better, but there are still some issues. I think women should have a voice to talk about their problems. That is the major way to solve the problems. In addition, women should go to areas of high position in politics, business, and education. I think when the same number of women and men belong to the area of politics, business, and education, it will make a fair society and country. I hope it becomes true, so it will make a beautiful world for everyone.

                            14. which religion has a view on women closer to how women are viewed in the philippinesESSAY!​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines is a predominantly Catholic nation. As a result, most of the traditions in our country run parallel with Catholic and Christian beliefs. Events like fiestas and processions, sacraments including Baptism, Holy Eucharist and Matrimony, and celebrations such as Easter and Christmas are now deeply rooted in the Filipino culture. Generally speaking, Catholicism has been attached to the Filipino identity from the moment the Spaniards introduced it to us in the 16th century. I grew up in a Catholic family—my parents and relatives are all Roman Catholics. In my younger years, I already remember my parents teaching me basic Catholic prayers and telling me stories or parables from the Bible. In addition, I spent my grade school and high school years in a Catholic school in Pasig. For ten years, we would pray before and after every subject and break time. Catholic retreats, recollections, seminars, and outreach events became a part of our student life, apart from having religion classes three times a week. In short, I grew up actively practicing the Catholic faith, with Jesus as the center and the role model of my life. I grew up believing that God, our Almighty Father, is the most powerful Being behind the creation of the universe—all of his attributes and characteristics are beyond measure.</p><br />

Women and men are different in any given scenarios, and each of the sex is blessed with certain qualities. These qualities make them different, and in the past because of these qualities they were stereotyped to do certain kind of work, like men as possessed more physical power as compared to women, so they were entitled as a bread earner.

Men have been ruling the business world since ages, now when women have stepped into their regime it seems like they are doing better. Many top-notch companies today are running because of women. For instance, Yahoo Company, which was previously ruled by a male CEO is now under a lady CEO, Marissa. This CEO shift is one of the best examples to show how women are doing great in business because of their leadership skills. According to one of the many surveys posted on huff post, it is found that women are better leaders than man. The Leadership development consultancy firm Zenger/Folkman, write in the Harvard Business Review what they found in a survey that they conducted on 7,280 leaders. Those leaders were judged based on 360 by rating each leader 's overall effectiveness and on "the 16 competencies that our 30 years of research shows are most important to overall leadership effectiveness.” The study showcased that higher the positions women achieve better they are than their male counterpart. This situation is arising because of two factors. First, women are proving to be a better leader than men. They have better ability to read the situation, and then adjust her leadership accordingly.
