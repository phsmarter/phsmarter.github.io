                            1. Argumentative Essay about Tree Planting​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p><p>Tree planting is a simple yet effective way to contribute to the environment and help mitigate the effects of climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, release oxygen, provide shade and shelter, prevent soil erosion, and support biodiversity. Therefore, it is important for individuals and communities to prioritize tree planting as a means to combat environmental issues.</p><p></p><p>One of the main benefits of tree planting is its impact on the environment. Trees act as natural carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in their biomass. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, a single tree can absorb up to 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. By planting trees, we can help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><p></p><p>In addition, trees provide many ecosystem services. They help to prevent soil erosion by anchoring the soil with their roots, and they provide shade and shelter for wildlife. Trees also improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen. In urban areas, trees can help to reduce the heat island effect, which occurs when buildings and roads absorb and re-radiate heat, making cities hotter than surrounding rural areas.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, planting trees has social and economic benefits. Trees provide aesthetic value and can enhance the overall beauty of a community. They can also increase property values, improve mental health by providing a sense of calm, and provide opportunities for outdoor recreation. Additionally, planting trees can create jobs in forestry and related industries.</p><p></p><p>Despite these benefits, there are some arguments against tree planting. One common argument is that trees can be a fire hazard, especially in areas prone to wildfires. While this is a legitimate concern, proper tree management and maintenance can reduce the risk of fires. Another argument is that trees can be expensive to plant and maintain. However, many organizations and government agencies offer grants and funding to support tree planting initiatives.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, tree planting is an effective way to combat climate change, support biodiversity, and provide social and economic benefits. While there are some concerns associated with tree planting, the benefits far outweigh the costs. It is important for individuals and communities to prioritize tree planting and work towards creating a more sustainable future.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The clotting factor works together with platelets to clot blood by helping the platelets to stick together and plug cuts on the vessel. This stops the bleeding. A person can have mild, moderate, or severe Hemophilia, depending on how much clotting factor they have. A person without Hemophilia has 100% of these clotting factors, while a person with severe Hemophilia has less than one percent. </p><p>            The disease is more common in men, affecting approximately one in 5,000 each year. this is because the Hemophilia gene is only located on the X chromosome. Men have one X and one Y chromosome, which means that if the X chromosome has the faulty gene, they will be born with Hemophilia. Women, however, have two X chromosomes. They will only be born with Hemophilia if both X chromosomes have the bad gene. If only one has it, the woman becomes a carrier of the disease. This means that she doesn’t have the disease, but she is able to pass it on to her children. A female can be born with Hemophilia if her dad has it and her mom is a carrier of it. Although Hemophilia is a genetic disease, some males are born with it even if neither of their parents have it. </p><p>               An individual with Hemophilia should know all of the signs and symptoms of the disease, as well as when it is necessary to go to the doctor or emergency room such as: very heavy continuous bleeding, limited motion, pain or swelling of the joints, or any signs of bleeding in the brain as these can be life threatening. When dealing with children who have hemophilia, it is best to inform them about the disease that they have, as well as put them in support groups. They should be protected with kneepads, elbow pads, and helmets when biking or doing similar activities. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Hemophilia is usually <strong>an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.</strong> This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery.<p>Hemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.

                        <p>"What Can The Philippines Expect With <strong>President Duterte</strong>’s Remaining Years As President
"</p><p>During President Duterte’s <strong>State of the Nation Address (SONA 2018)</strong> held last July 23, 2018 at the <strong>Batasang Pambansa</strong>, he mentioned several points that are important to any<strong> Filipino citizen</strong>. They are the following:
</p><p>-	Drug war
</p><p>-	Corruption
</p><p>-	Promise on Mindanao
</p><p>-	The Bangsamoro law
</p><p>-	Marawi Siege
</p><p>-	Foreign policy
</p><p>-	OFWs
</p><p>-	Contractualization
</p><p>-	Opportunities for coconut farmers
</p><p>-	Developments with telecommunications and the internet
</p><p>-	Closure of Boracay island
</p><p>-	Creation of a National Land Use Policy
</p><p>-	Disaster Management
</p><p>-	Given warnings to miners
</p><p>-	Tax reformation
</p><p>-	Passing of the Universal Health Care Bill
</p><p>-	Shift to federalism in terms of governance
</p><p>Reviewing the lineup of these key points as delivered at the SONA 2018, the Filipinos can only remain to be hopeful. Some critics already pointed out that there were promises made during the President’s first SONA that still remained as promises until now. 
</p><p>There are, however, changes that took the nation by storm such as the war on drugs. The country was brought to a standstill when the President first implemented this advocacy. It created a huge stir to the entire nation and there was a mixture in the responses. 
</p><p>The country is still yet to go through several changes if, for example, federalism will be approved. It seems that the citizens will forever be on the edge of their seat and complacency is but only a word. But despite the inevitability of what the future may bring, the Filipinos will remain to be this – resilient.
</p><p>It is, in fact, what makes a Filipino a Filipino. We smile despite the tears. We rise despite adversities. We hope despite the hopelessness. We remain to have faith that the officials appointed in today’s government were brought there for a purpose and a good purpose.

                            12. narrative essay about communication issues​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>narrative essay</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Communication is a vital process in organizations and companies in today’s world. It has been defined as an activity that entails transmitting information through interexchange of views or messages by behavior, signals, writing, visuals, and speech. The process of communication requires a sender, the message to be sent, and a receiver. However, it is mandatory for the receiver to be aware of the sender’s intention to communicate. This means that a sender can be able to communicate with a receiver across vast distances (Wilson 2010).
</p><p>
</p><p>Normally, the communication the process is complete after it is clear that the receiver understood the message as intended by the sender. Communicative commonality is integral to effective communication between communicating parties. Effective communication is not only needed inside an organization but also when dealing with external stakeholders. It enables organization to achieve competitive edge considering the fact that it through it that an organization remains responsive to consumer needs (Jones &amp; George 2007). On the contrary, poor communication disrupts almost everything in an organization.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a number of barriers to effective communication (Huczynski &amp; Buchanan 2010). This paper intends to highlight the barriers and how three organizations (Professional Sports, Bernard Mathews, and NHS trust Hospital) have been able to handle the barriers to ensure effective communication. Barriers to Effective Communication Barriers to communication are factors that might hinder effective communication between parties in the workplace. According to Antony and MacVicar (2011), this includes language barriers, cultural barriers, organizational barriers, personal barriers, and interpersonal barriers.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Communication Issues
</p><p>Each of us communicate on a daily basis, but oftentimes we miscommunicate and do not get our intended point across. There are a lot of guidelines that help to make for more effective communications, one being is to have eye contact with the person you are communicating with. By looking at the person it shows that a you are interested in what the person is saying and are paying attention and is engaged with the conversation. By a lack of eye contact with another other person, it shows that you are disinterested in the conversation. By practicing direct eye contact with the person you are speaking to, will assist in maintaining good lines of communication. Besides, eye contact, it is important to be a good listener. By asking “What” and “Why” questions it will ensure that you are attentive to the what the person is saying. In effective communications between two people, it is important that each individual understand what message is being communicated. It also important to reflect upon what a person has said when there is a pause in the communication. This allows for each individual to think about the conversation and maintain a continuous flow of the conversation. It should be noted that good communications between individuals is a two-way street.
</p><p>As for me personally, there are a lot of situations that has made me a good listener. Oftentimes, I was interrupting the people who were speaking and not listening to what they were talking about. There was a problem for me to be attentive to the details of conversation and I had not listened to them during the conversation and forgetting most everything that was said. One day during a conversation, a friend told me that my problem was that I was not a good listener. They went on to say that I needed to develop more effective listening skills. They suggested that during a conversation, I should focus on a what is being said, remain silent until the speaker has completed what they were saying. In turn, it would show to the speaker that I was interested in what they were saying. It should also be noted that during a conversation, the subject should not be changed as it will disrupt the communication process. When engaged in conversation, I should put aside my own thoughts and intently listen to what the person is saying. I should place all of my attention to the speaker and not hurry the speaker before they have completed what they are saying.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps...</p><br />

                            27. narrative essay about political issue​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Political corruption has existed throughout the ages. It believed to be most prominent in positions of power, because of the role money plays in getting people power. However, over the centuries, corruption has changed so much so as to not match a particular definition of corruption, perpetually growing deceptively harder to find (Ebbe). </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The broadest, most suitable definition which exists today simply states that corruption is any illegal act performed by a politician to produce results which would have been otherwise impossible (Ebbe).  In some cases, government, politicians, and criminals entwine for the sake of amassing money in order to secure their own jobs. This form of corruption was apparent in the mafia’s association</p><p></p><p>This paired with poor law enforcement yields an impossibly hard to get rid of corruption. In Kenya, political corruption has grown rampant. People, who are supposed to be representing the interests of their constituency, instead take money from the constituents to keep their representative positions. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Political corruption is parasitic; it finds a host, and can almost always find a way to survive. Eventually, people grow dependent on this corruption as a means for income, thus forming a symbiosis between the people who benefit from it, and the elites that regulate it. People sometimes ignore the corruption surrounding them, feeling that as long as the politicians do their jobs well, their ‘extra salary’ can’t hurt (BNS).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Generally after revolutions take place, anarchy exists. No new government simply moves into place. During this time, it is easiest for Corruption to take hold of this Government as it forms, limiting or halting the true development of a government for the people. In an environment infested with corruption, any acts of corruption simply become commonplace. Where anarchy exists, people lack the power of representation. If there is a government in which corruption exists, people lack a voice with which to take action.  A government is necessary for the growth of people and nations as a whole.

Upon arrival to the Phadam camp and after a mere 15-minute drive from the camp to a trail not far off the road, the members of the Phadam group, the IVCA crew, and nearly 80 volunteers began the 1-hour hike to the planting site for the day. Surrounded by lush forest and hundreds of different species of flowers, insects, spiders and plants, the hike was nothing short of wondrous.</p><p></p><p>Ito lng po mabibigay q.</p><p></p><br />
