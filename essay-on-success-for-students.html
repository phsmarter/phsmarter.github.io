                                            Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                            1. "STUDENT GRADES DO NOT MEASURE SUCCESS"
ESSAY</h2><br />
                        <p>Student grades do not measure success, because the kindness, ability, hardwork, perseverance and patience measures it. Students shouldn't be dependent on  what is the result of their grades. Its just numbers that aims to show the result of our performance in our academics. School is not just place to learn, but it is the world and our environment. We don't get success in not just having high grades. Becuase sometimes other people who has a high achievement in academics dont get success becuase they dont experience mistakes. In conclusion, people are the ones who will choose if they want to be successful even they don't achieve an honor in school. For me, it's HARDWORK THAT MATTERS. and the fulfillment in the path they are going. Life is a like traveling, the we much appreciate the roads which represent the experience in our lives not just the destination we are going through. </p><p></p><p>Pabrainliest please...</p><p>Pasalamat ka naman ang haba ng sagot ko </p><br />

                            2. "Most Memorable Success or Failures as a Student"             
essay type 100 word </h2><br />
                        <p>As a student, my most memorable success was when I received an academic award for being at the top of my class. It was a proud moment for me as I worked hard to achieve this recognition. It made me realize that all the effort and time I put into studying paid off. On the other hand, my most memorable failure was when I received a failing grade on a major exam. I was devastated and disappointed in myself. However, it taught me a valuable lesson that failure is a part of life, and it's how we respond to it that matters. It motivated me to work harder and strive for better results.</p>As a student, I have had my share of successes and failures, which have taught me valuable lessons about life. My most memorable success was when I graduated from high school with flying colors, while my most significant failure was when I flunked my first college course.<br /><br />My high school graduation was the pinnacle of my academic success since I had stayed focused and disciplined throughout my academic journey. I had managed to balance my studies, extracurricular activities, and social life, which contributed significantly to my success. I had also maintained a positive attitude and remained motivated, despite the challenges I encountered. I remember feeling elated when I received my diploma, knowing that all my hard work had paid off.<br /><br />My college life started on a low note when I failed my first course. I was overconfident and assumed that the college workload would be similar to that of high school. I neglected my studies and instead focused on making new friends and having fun. Consequently, I performed dismally, and it was a humbling experience. However, I learned an essential lesson from my failure, that college life requires discipline, time management, and prioritization. I had to work harder and become more organized to catch up with my peers.<br /><br />Another success I'm proud of is when I received a scholarship to study abroad. This achievement was a result of my commitment to excellence and dedication to my studies. It was an opportunity to explore new cultures, gain knowledge and skills, and make lifelong connections. I was excited to be part of a diverse academic community and learn new things that would benefit me both academically and personally.<br /><br />On the other hand, my most significant failure in college was when I procrastinated on my thesis, and I missed the deadline. Despite knowing the importance of submitting it on time, I did not take it seriously, and I paid the price. It was a significant setback, and I had to repeat the semester. However, I learned that procrastination is never productive and that time management is key in achieving academic success.<br /><br />In conclusion, as a student, I have experienced both success and failure, which have shaped my academic journey. While my successes have given me a sense of pride, my mistakes and failures have taught me valuable lessons. I have learned to be disciplined, organized, and focused on my academic goals. I am confident that with the lessons I have learned, I can overcome any challenges that may come my way and achieve excellence academically and beyond.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation") is the study of the past. ... "History" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events.</p><p></p><p>2.By studying history you'll gain a range of transferable skills, from informed citizenship and critical thinking, to research and general awareness. What's more, the knowledge acquired through the study of history is relevant in a wide range of disciplines and can lead to diverse employment opportunities.</p><p></p><p>3.Studying history helps us understand and grapple with complex questions and dilemmas by examining how the past has shaped (and continues to shape) global, national, and local relationships between societies and people.</p><p></p><p>4.History can guide learners to see trends and processes in a broader, holistic perspective and to understand them. Through History they come into contact with other cultures and societies and in this way they gain a more holistic understanding of the contemporary world and their place in this broader context.</p><p></p><p>5.Cultural heritage is something that all human beings share; wherever we come from there is a culture that follows us from that place. No matter where you grow up, where you go, your culture will always be something you can take with you. Cultural heritage can come in many forms: tangible, intangible, and natural. Tangible heritage consists of artifacts like sculptures, paintings, manuscripts, etc. Intangible heritage consists of oral tradition, rituals, and performing arts. Natural heritage consist of cultural landscapes and geological landscapes, any type of landscape that is naturally formed. It is very important that we protect our cultural heritage so our future generations can continue to look upon their past as we do. I believe it is very important that we teach our high school students the value in protecting their cultural heritage. The importance behind the types of cultural heritages in a student’s life should be relevant in their education. Speaking in terms of literature, I believe that students should be exposed to literature and oral stories from the past that connects to their culture today, whether it be reading Beowulf or Sylvia Plath; students can connect to the characters in this literature by studying further into where the content they are reading came from and how they connect to it in their modern lives. When we think about cultural heritage in the classroom, we might not be sure how to take on such a large topic especially in a classroom setting.

There is a strong parent-led campaign in your city to curb down on homework or assignments given to students. As a student, however, you feel homework is essential to promoting learning. Write a paper arguing your stand by giving specific examples and statistics to show the benefits of homework. 2. There has been a concentrated campaign in your school to control bullying. While the campaign has been largely successful within schools, bullying has now reared its ugly head in online communities. Explain the difference of online bullying from real-life bullying, and what steps can be taken to prevent it. 3. In a globalized world, learning a foreign language has become increasingly important. Do you agree or disagree? Use facts, statistics, and studies to supplement your views.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a world where globalization has become the norm, the ability to understand and speak a foreign language has become increasingly important. I strongly agree that learning a foreign language is critical for several reasons. Firstly, it allows individuals to communicate with individuals from different parts of the world. Secondly, it can help improve cognitive abilities as individuals who speak multiple languages have been found to perform better in tasks such as problem-solving, creativity, and multitasking. Finally, it can open up new career opportunities and make individuals more marketable in today's job market.</p><p></p><p>Learning a foreign language can help individuals communicate and connect with people from different cultures. As travel becomes more accessible, individuals are finding themselves needing to speak foreign languages to communicate with hotel staff, tour guides, and local residents. For example, individuals who speak Chinese Mandarin can easily interact with individuals living in China, as well as Chinese-speaking individuals in other countries. This can lead to a better and more positive experience for both parties, which can foster deeper connections and stronger relationships.</p><p></p><p>Studies have also shown that individuals who speak multiple languages display better cognitive abilities compared to those who speak only one language. Bilingual individuals have been found to perform better in tasks that require problem-solving and creative thinking. This is because of the cognitive benefits of learning a foreign language. Learning a new language requires individuals to develop better memory, concentration, and multitasking skills, which can help them become more effective in other areas of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Learning a foreign language provides individuals with new career opportunities, making them more marketable in today's job market. With globalization, many multinational companies require their employees to speak at least two languages to communicate with clients, suppliers, and shareholders. This means that individuals who speak a foreign language have a better chance of obtaining a higher salary, job promotions, and new job opportunities. Additionally, learning a foreign language can help individuals interact and network with people from different regions and cultures, further expanding their employment opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, learning a foreign language is essential in today's globalized world. It provides individuals with the ability to communicate with people from different parts of the world, improves cognitive abilities, and increases career opportunities. With statistics and studies supporting the benefits of learning a foreign language, it's clear that individuals should make every effort to learn a second language.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) answer. </p><p>As a student, I believe that homework is essential to promoting learning, and I do not support the idea of reducing or eliminating it. While I understand the concerns of some parents who feel that their children are being overloaded with homework, I believe that homework has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As a student, I believe that homework is essential to promoting learning, and I do not support the idea of reducing or eliminating it. While I understand the concerns of some parents who feel that their children are being overloaded with homework, I believe that homework has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework promotes independent learning and time management skills. When students are given homework, they are required to complete it on their own, without the immediate support of a teacher. This allows them to develop their own learning strategies and work at their own pace, which is a valuable skill that they will need in higher education and beyond. Furthermore, homework helps students to develop time management skills, as they must learn to balance the demands of school work with other activities and responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework provides an opportunity for students to practice and reinforce what they have learned in class. In subjects like mathematics, science, and foreign languages, students need to practice regularly to master the concepts and skills. Homework assignments allow students to apply what they have learned in class to real-world situations, which helps to reinforce the learning and deepen their understanding of the subject matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, homework provides teachers with a means of assessing student learning and progress. By assigning homework, teachers can evaluate the level of understanding and mastery of the subject matter, and adjust their instruction accordingly. Homework also provides a basis for feedback and evaluation, which is essential for improving student performance.</p><p></p><br />

                            17. Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                            30. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.
