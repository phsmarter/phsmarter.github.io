                        AnswerMary, also called St. Mary or the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, venerated in the Christian church since the apostolic age and a favourite subject in Western art, music, and literature. Mary is known from biblical references, which are, however, too sparse to construct a coherent biography. The development of the doctrine of Mary can be traced through titles that have been ascribed to her in the history of the Christian communions—guarantee of the Incarnation, virgin mother, second Eve, mother of God, ever virgin, immaculate, and assumed into heaven. She has a number of feast days in various Christian traditions, several of which are holy days of obligation for Roman Catholics.By far the most voluminous narratives about Mary in the New Testament are the infancy stories in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. In their present form, both accounts make a point of asserting that Jesus was conceived in the womb of Mary without any human agency <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps ✨ </p><br />

                            3. essay of the story of heneral luna 300 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Heneral Luna”, 2015 is a Filipino historical biopic film about General Antonio Luna. It is indeed one of the most beautiful movies I’ve ever seen. The cinematography, cast, writing is really wonderful and realistic, although the language used is not what I expected because it looks too modern. The film shows the point of view of Gen. Antonio Luna in the system of the Philippines in the American invasion period. Furthermore, the movie carries joy, laughter, sorrow, grief, conflicts, and realizations especially when it became an eye opener for me. As an ‘International Studies’ student, it’s typical for us to have some interest in different culture other than us although I never actually detest our culture. However, with this film I observe a lot of admirable actions as well as a lot of flaws in our country all the way from the late 18th century. I also noticed that the Philippine government in the past greatly resembles the government issues in the present, just like how the cabinet members prefers to be under the power of United States to aim more money and superiority in their own state. Gen. Antonio Luna deserves to be one of our heroes. He showed great bravery, intelligence and he also became an inspiration to our fellow men during and even after the war. He really holds superior power and can lead people to follow him. The general also believes that no one is above the law even the highest ranking official or the president. Now, as the 2016 presidential elections approaches, Gen. Antonio Luna’s perspectives become an unofficial scoring ground to question the qualifications of the candidates from what I saw in the internet, what I heard while commuting and what I also thought of. However, I also thought that Gen. Luna does not listen to what the others think of. This a sort of a good attitude but sometimes it can also become really bad. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>n 1898, Gen. Antonio Luna (John Arcilla) faces resistance from his own countrymen as he fights for freedom during the Philippine-American War.</p><p>General Antonio Luna is one of the brilliant military man of the Filipinos as they fights for independence against the Americans after Spain,their former colonist,has ceded the Philippines to them  </p><p>
</p><p>Because of his bravery, Luna was named director of War on September 26, 1898. He became famous for bravery, unusual style of fighting, and strict discipline</p><p>Set during the Philippine-American war, a short-tempered Filipino general faces an enemy more formidable than the American army: his own treacherous countrymen.
</p><p>
</p><p>Set during the Philippine-American war, Heneral Luna follows the life of one of Philippine History's most brilliant soldier, General Antonio Luna, as he tries to lead his countrymen against colonial masters new and old, and to rise above their own raging disputes to fulfill the promise of the Philippine Revolution.</p><p>General Antonio Luna (John Arcilla), commander of the revolutionary army, is spoiling for a fight. After three hundred years as a Spanish colony, the Philippines must endure a new foreign power: the United States of America. General Luna wants to fight for freedom but members of the elite want to strike a deal with the Americans. The infighting is fierce in the new cabinet but General Luna and his loyal men forge ahead even as his military decisions are met with resistance from soldiers who are loyal only to President Aguinaldo (Mon Confiado). Ultimately, it is the general’s legendary temper and pride that bring him to his death when a pack of presidential guards assassinate him in broad daylight. While American newspapers blame Aguinaldo, the mystery of General Luna’s assassination was never completely solved and his killers never put to justice.</p><p>Heneral Luna is a powerful examination not only of one man’s life but, more significantly, of the theme that Filipinos are their own worst enemies—a theme that resonates mightily in these times.”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            4. tell the story when you experienced to be in conflict, either internal or external for 300 words ​</h2><br />
                        Answer:<p></p><p>One of the most challenging conflicts that a person may face is a personal dilemma between right and wrong, particularly when the decision affects the people they care about. For instance, imagine a situation where a recent college graduate has landed a job but is not satisfied with the salary. The dilemma arises when she has been approached by her best friend's company, offering her a higher position with a more substantial income. Moving to the new company would mean abandoning the current job and working for a competitor. </p><p></p><p>The young woman is torn between staying loyal to her boss and leaving for a better job opportunity. The internal struggle is real, and the decision-making process is difficult. The young woman values integrity, honesty, and loyalty, but she also wishes to have a better career and provide for her family. She wrestles with her choices, seeking advice from friends and family. </p><p></p><p>In the end, she decides to stay with the current job, believing that integrity and loyalty are essential in life.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the rolling hills of the countryside, there lived a young man named Jack. Jack was a hardworking and kind-hearted person, beloved by all who knew him. Despite his many virtues, however, Jack struggled with one particular issue: he had a stutter.</p><p></p><p>Since childhood, Jack had struggled to speak clearly and fluently, and as he grew older, this issue began to hold him back. He found it difficult to make friends and was often teased by other children for his speech impediment. As he entered adulthood, Jack began to feel ashamed of his stutter and withdrew from social situations whenever possible.</p><p></p><p>One day, a wise old man who lived on the edge of the village approached Jack and offered to help him overcome his stutter. The old man, who was known throughout the village for his knowledge and wisdom, explained that Jack's stutter was not a weakness, but rather a challenge that he could overcome with practice and perseverance.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few weeks, the old man worked with Jack every day, teaching him exercises and techniques to improve his speech. At first, Jack found it difficult to let go of his old habits, but with time and practice, he began to see improvement.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, Jack's stutter all but disappeared, and he was able to speak with confidence and ease. His transformation was so remarkable that the people of the village took notice, and Jack became a well-respected member of the community.</p><p></p><p>As he looked back on the journey he had taken, Jack couldn't help but feel grateful for the old man's guidance and support. He knew that without the old man's help, he might have remained trapped in his own self-doubt and insecurity.</p><p></p><p>And so, Jack lived the rest of his days as a happy and confident individual, enjoying the many blessings that life had to offer and spreading joy and kindness wherever he went.</p><p></p><br />

                            8. What are the characteristics of Hindu Literature present in the story Ramayana? 
[Explain 300-400 words]</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Religion</p><p>Based on the ancient history of India dominated by Brahmins, the upper educated ruling priestly class, Religion (Spirituality) was the primary concern.</p><p></p><p>Deeds</p><p>‘Deeds of the past determine the state of the present’ is the concept of reincarnation. If noble deeds are done in the past, noble birth in the present is assured. Ramayana is the story of Ram, the reincarnation of Lord Vishnu.</p><p></p><p>Human Values</p><p>Human values are also a characteristic of Indian literature within the broader web of ‘Religion’. Obedience-  to the one above, to keep up the words spoken i.e not breaking promises at any cost, bravery- in war are the important values imparted through the sacred books and epics.</p><p></p><p>Obedience</p><p>Obedience to the above  it can mean a person in power or an elder person. As in Ramayana, Ram obeyed his father Dasharatha when asked to go into exile and Hanuman (an ape hero) obeys Sugriva (the ape king) immediately when he was asked to go in search of Sita, Rama’s wife.</p><p></p><p>Bravery</p><p>Bravery in war front is seen in both Ramayana and Mahabharata which involves the two great epic wars; The Ramayana war and The Mahabharata war- battle at Kurukshetra where the army of both the parties (Rama and Ravana in Ramayana) and (Pandavas and Kauravas in Mahabharata) fight bravely for victory.</p><p></p><p>Love</p><p>‘Love’ is one of the major characteristic focused on Indian literature. All forms of love as Parental love (In Janaka, king of Mithila made him accept Sita found in-furrow of the field, as his daughter and Dasharatha dies after Rama is sent to exile), Marital love (In Sita, that she accompanied her husband Rama into exile), love of brothers (In Lakshmana that he accompanied Rama into exile and in Bharata that he rejected the crown) and love of friends (in Karna that he stands by Kauravas against his own brothers) are included.</p><p></p><p>Morality</p><p>Virtue rewarded and vice punished is the justice done according to the Dharma, which is a characteristic of Indian literature. </p><p></p><p>Poetic Form</p><p>The poetic form was considered as the standard written form in ancient India, that Indian literature was in verses. Ramayana has 24,000 verses and Mahabharata has over 100,000 verses that it takes time for readers to understand them. Sacred books were also in the poetic form called Mantras that are recited during worship. All these forms the characteristic of Indian literature.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Took me pretty long to do this haha </p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>9</strong><strong>5</strong><strong> </strong><strong>words </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>2</strong><strong>,</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>4</strong><strong> </strong>characters</p><p>here's the proof (Look at the picture)</p><br />

                        Answer:<br /><br />I was just a girl who lived an ordinary life. A life that I lived, I liked. I liked how my days are good, or when it's bad. I don't think much about guys, nor feel any intimacy with one. I'm not even scared of them—I just feel numb. I don't feel love, nor don't feel hate. I'm like someone who's both alive and dead. But not until I've gone through a hard time of my life.<br /><br />There was a day where I got tired of the world. I've got tired of living my life, to the point where I wanted things to come to end. Surprisingly, he came into the background. He was like a sunlight that shined into my darkest days. He holds me close, keeps me safe—and I do feel safe. I feel like we can overcome the world when we're together. Funny, how things got so much easier for me. Things were great and good, and it feels nice. My feet were stumbling in a rock, but he's always there holding me up.<br /><br />My story was miserable, not until he came into my life. He became my life, and I became his. We endured, love each other, and were able to pass the tests of this life. Even things are like these, I'm happy. I'm happy that he's around, and is always there to reach his hand and make me feel safe. I love him. And that's how our story goes.<br /><br />Explanation:<br />Hope this helps! This is just fictional HAHA totally single<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, there lived a girl named Lily. From a young age, Lily was fascinated by the world around her. She would spend hours exploring the forests, rivers, and mountains that surrounded her home, always eager to learn more about the natural world.</p><p></p><p>As she grew older, Lily's love of geography only deepened. She would spend hours poring over maps and reading books about different countries and cultures. She dreamed of one day traveling the world, experiencing all the different landscapes and meeting people from all walks of life.</p><p></p><p>Despite her love of exploration and adventure, however, Lily was also a deeply introspective and reflective person. She would often spend long hours alone, lost in thought, contemplating the mysteries of the universe and her own place in it.</p><p></p><p>One day, as she was hiking in the mountains, Lily came across a hidden cave. Intrigued, she ventured inside, determined to explore every nook and cranny. As she crept deeper and deeper into the cave, she began to feel a sense of awe and wonder that she had never experienced before. The sheer magnitude and complexity of the natural world were almost overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after what seemed like hours, Lily emerged from the cave, blinking in the bright sunlight. She felt a sense of profound gratitude and humility, knowing that she was just a tiny speck in the grand scheme of things.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, Lily's love of geography took on a new dimension. She began to see the natural world not just as something to explore and conquer, but as something to be respected and revered. She became an advocate for conservation and sustainability, working to preserve the beauty and diversity of the world she loved so much.</p><p></p><p>And yet, despite her deep concern for the planet, Lily remained a deeply introspective and reflective person. She knew that the truest journey was not one of physical exploration, but one of inner growth and understanding. And so she continued to wander the world, not just with her feet, but with her mind and her heart as well.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: here</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who lived in a small village at the foot of a mountain. She had always been fascinated by the stories that her grandfather used to tell her about the mysterious creatures that lived in the mountain. Her grandfather had told her that the mountain was enchanted and that it was home to magical beings who could grant wishes to anyone who dared to venture inside.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One day, Lily decided to explore the mountain in search of the magical beings. She packed some food and water and set out on her adventure. As she climbed higher, she saw the most beautiful flowers she had ever seen, and she picked a few to take back home.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>As she climbed further, she saw a waterfall, and she decided to take a rest and enjoy the refreshing water. But as she was about to take a sip, she saw a small creature with shimmering wings perched on a rock beside the waterfall. It was a fairy, just like the ones her grandfather had told her about.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Lily was thrilled and approached the fairy with caution. The fairy introduced herself as Iris and asked Lily what brought her to the mountain. Lily told her about her wish to meet the magical beings and to have her own wish granted.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Iris listened carefully and told Lily that the magical beings only granted wishes to those who had pure intentions and who were willing to help others. She gave Lily a small flower and told her to plant it in her village and to take care of it.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Lily thanked Iris and made her way back down the mountain. When she reached the village, she planted the flower and took care of it every day. The flower grew into a beautiful tree that provided shade and shelter for the villagers.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One day, a group of travelers came to the village, and they were amazed by the beautiful tree. They asked Lily how she managed to grow such a beautiful tree in such a short time. Lily told them about the fairy and the small flower she had planted on the mountain.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The travelers were touched by Lily's kindness and decided to help her village by building a school and a hospital. Lily's wish had come true, and she had helped her village in a big way. From that day on, Lily became known as the girl who brought magic to her village, and her story was told for generations to come.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time in a land far away, there was a young girl named Lily who loved to explore the forest near her home. She went on many adventures, discovering new plants and animals, and always returned home before sunset. One day, Lily's curiosity led her deeper into the forest than she had ever been before.</p><p></p><p>As she walked, she heard the sound of rushing water. Following the sound, she came upon a beautiful river that flowed through the forest. She was so captivated by its beauty that she didn't notice the dark clouds gathering overhead.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, lightning struck a nearby tree, causing it to fall and block Lily's path back home. She was trapped with no way out and no shelter from the brewing storm. Lily began to panic and wondered if she would ever make it back home.</p><p></p><p>As the storm raged on, Lily noticed a small cave on the other side of the river. She knew it was risky, but she had no other choice. She stripped off her shoes and waded into the icy cold water. She clambered up onto the bank, shivering and soaked to the bone.</p><p></p><p>Lily made her way into the cave and was surprised to find a small fire burning in the center. She was even more surprised to see a group of animals huddled around the fire, including a fox, a rabbit, and a hedgehog. They welcomed her warmly and offered her a seat by the fire.</p><p></p><p>As they waited out the storm, Lily learned that the animals had been hiding in the cave during storms for years. They had formed a community and relied on each other for survival. The fox would hunt for food, the rabbit would find water, and the hedgehog would provide warmth during the cold nights.</p><p></p><p>When the storm finally passed, Lily thanked the animals for their hospitality and made her way back home. She had learned a valuable lesson about the importance of community and the impact of the natural world. From that day forward, she made it a point to always respect and care for the world around her.</p><p></p><p>Years later, Lily returned to the cave and found a plaque that read, "In honor of Lily, who taught us the importance of community and the beauty of the natural world." She smiled, knowing that her adventure had left a lasting impact on the animals and the land she loved.</p><br />

                        The Seasons of Life<br /><br />There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn to not judge things too quickly. So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away.<br /><br />The first son went in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in the fall.<br /><br />When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe what they had seen.<br /><br />The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and twisted.<br /><br />The second son said no – it was covered with green buds and full of promise.<br /><br />The third son disagreed, he said it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful, it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen.<br /><br />The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfilment.<br /><br />The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but one season in the tree’s life.<br /><br />He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence of who they are – and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life – can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.<br /><br />If you give up when it’s winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer, fulfilment of your fall.<br /><br />Don’t judge a life by one difficult season. Don’t let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest.

So by this moment I questioning myself, why if we just have at least one desire for our country and that is to become a peaceful or stop those fighting for an individual purposes. As I think all of the problem that we are facing nowadays are because of without of an enough good characters to respect and to conduct what all of us deserve to have. And those are because of pursuing to conquer all of something that they want whether its came from a crime activity. Either because we all wanted to get up in a poverty whether its only way is to kill or to be kill. Or to cheat, raped for your individual needs. Why people doesn't think what will happens to them after death ? Are they stop doing those such of thing if its the end of all ? Either if the judgement of our almighty god serve to them ? They haven't think that there where a second life and the most important at all because that two are an everlasting life in heaven and everlasting death in hell. So why we spend our time for the worst doing ? Why if we just change not for a while instead until dead. Because its not the end of all to change. Its because god is good and he will forgiven you whatever your sin have you done.  Because he only wants is all of us we're live in his promise Land where he wont let you to cry instead you will fell his everlasting love and you will fell there the happiest meaning of life. <br />                <br />

                            19. make a structuralist essay about the story of The wedding dance​ (300 words) </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I hope it helps, pa-brainliest din po ty.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The story of "The Wedding Dance" by Amador Daguio can be analyzed through a structuralist lens, which focuses on the underlying structures and systems that shape and influence the text. The story is set in the Philippines and revolves around a couple, Awiyao and Lumnay, who are facing marital problems due to their inability to have a child. The story is structured around a series of binary oppositions, which highlight the tensions and conflicts within the story.</p><p></p><p>The first binary opposition in the story is between tradition and modernity. Awiyao wants to marry another woman who can bear him children, as this is seen as a traditional duty of a wife in their culture. Lumnay, on the other hand, represents modernity and independence, as she has refused to have a child with Awiyao due to the physical and emotional strain it would cause her. This tension between tradition and modernity is a central theme of the story and reflects the clash between traditional and modern values in Philippine society.</p><p></p><p>The second binary opposition in the story is between love and duty. Awiyao loves Lumnay, but he feels a duty to his family and community to have a child. Lumnay, meanwhile, loves Awiyao but is torn between her desire to be with him and her unwillingness to bear a child. This tension between love and duty is a recurring theme in the story and reflects the conflicting demands placed on individuals in traditional societies.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The third binary opposition in the story is between the individual and the community. Awiyao is torn between his love for Lumnay and his duty to his community, which requires him to have a child to continue the family line. Lumnay, meanwhile, is torn between her love for Awiyao and her desire to assert her individuality and independence. This tension between the individual and the community is a central theme of the story and reflects the conflict between personal desires and social expectations in traditional societies.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "The Wedding Dance" can be analyzed as a complex interplay of binary oppositions, which reflect the tensions and conflicts within the story. These oppositions highlight the clash between tradition and modernity, the tension between love and duty, and the conflict between the individual and the community. Through its intricate structure, the story offers a nuanced portrayal of the complex social and cultural dynamics of Philippine society.</p><br />

                            20. What have you learn about the story of pencil. In your own word 300 words please pakisagot Ng matino​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story of a pencil is simple at first but contains a lot of messages to get by. The following points can be learned from the story of a pencil by Paulo Coelho:</p><p></p><p>1. Make corrections after learning from your mistakes.</p><p></p><p>In daily life, a pencil is a helpful instrument that we use for both writing and drawing. Unintentionally making a mistake while using a pencil is possible, but there is an eraser on the pencil that you can use to correct the error and your written or drawn work. Because we are imperfect, humans make a lot of mistakes, but by learning from them, we can improve and gain wisdom. We must be able to start over after missteps and move on with our lives with a new outlook rather than letting them hold us back.</p><p></p><p>2. Life must be approached firmly but without too much pressure.</p><p></p><p>Whether writing or sketching, a pencil writes perfectly effectively when it is held firmly and directed. If the pencil is squeezed too hard, the tip may shatter or the pencil may split in half. The second thing we can learn from the pencil is that it's sage to approach life firmly with rules and disciplines in order to help us become valuable to both ourselves and the rest of the world. Self-imposed pressure might lead to your emotional, bodily, and spiritual collapse. As you build on the big idea, be patient and accomplish your goals one at a time.</p><p></p><p>3. You'll also need polishing and sharpening.</p><p></p><p>A pencil needs to be sharpened and polished in order to write clearly. Writing is improved with a sharp pointed pencil over a dull one. To create a clean, flawless drawing, an artist must ensure that their pencil is properly sharpened. As humans, we also need to be sharpened and polished to increase our value. We go through difficult times to strengthen us and get ready for bigger responsibilities in the future.</p><p></p><p>4. Looks can be deceiving.</p><p></p><p>Pencils are available in a range of colors and designs, depending on how the producer wants it to seem. The quality of the lead inside the pencil, not the branding, is what distinguishes it. Because humans have mastered the skill of faking, appearances can be misleading. So spend some time getting to know someone rather than a passing judgment based solely on appearance. To reach the right conclusion, understand their motivations and aspirations.</p><p></p><p>5. There is a use for each type of pencil.</p><p></p><p>For a variety of uses, numerous types of pencils are produced. There are pencils made for writing that write flawlessly, others made for drawing, and even another made for coloring. Each pencil performs well for its intended use.</p><p></p><p>Each of us was given a purpose when we were born as humans. Everyone possesses a quality about oneself that makes them unique. Our aim is to discover our purpose, develop as individuals, and serve the world. The article "Self Improvement is a Continuous Process" is another option.</p><p></p><p>6. Everything you do leaves a trace.</p><p></p><p>On a blank pad, writing with a pencil produces a mark that cannot be totally removed. It can be used to write things that unite people or things that divide them and make the world a better place. Every action we take while on this earth leaves a permanent imprint. When you treat someone kindly, it stays with them forever, just as when you treat someone badly, it stays with them forever. Our intention is to leave a fantastic lasting impression and foster happy memories.</p><p></p><p>hope this helps :D</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sad Story</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In the winter of 2020, my baby cousin was diagnosed with ATRT (a rare brain cancer). My aunt and uncle did EVERYTHING they could to save her, but the things they tried only delayed the inevitable. She fought it tooth and nail for over a year and a half, but ended up dying in early September last year, just a month and 3 days short of her second birthday. The morning she died, I sat up in bed to start getting ready for work about an hour after her time of death, and was immediately struck with a terrible headache on the left side of my brain (which I later found out was the same side of the brain that her tumor was on). Of course, I was an idiot and chalked the headache up to hormones since it was almost that time of the month, but halfway through my work day is when I found out she'd died about an hour before I finally made myself get up for work. Of course, I cried and wanted to pack my bags to leave and go home for the funeral, but I couldn't Unfortunately for me, I was over 200 miles away from home, and couldn't leave the island I was on for the funeral. Even 5 months later, I still haven't visited her grave, and I still feel bad about it. I was 16 and a half when she was born, and now at almost 19, I still don't have my driver's license. When I finally get it, I'm going to make a point of visiting her. I have a general idea of where she's buried, so hopefully I be can use that to find her grave.<br /><br /><br /><br />Credit by Lili</p><p>u/Vampira_Andres</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As a student, participating in a group project where we were tasked with creating a story was a valuable learning experience. The process of working together as a group allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the elements that go into creating a compelling narrative.</p><p></p><p>One of the most impactful aspects of this experience was the realization of the importance of collaboration in the creative process. Each member of the group brought their own unique perspective and ideas to the table, which helped to shape the final story in ways that I never would have imagined on my own. The process of bouncing ideas off of each other and building upon one another's contributions was crucial to the success of the project.</p><p></p><p>Another key realization was the importance of effective communication in a group setting. As we worked through the different stages of the project, it became clear that clear and consistent communication was essential to ensuring that everyone was on the same page. This experience highlighted the importance of effective listening and the ability to clearly articulate one's own ideas.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the group realization of the story and its impact on me as a student was the understanding of the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the creative process. As we worked on the story, we encountered many obstacles and challenges, and it was crucial that we were able to adapt and adjust our approach as needed. This experience taught me the importance of being open to new ideas and being willing to take risks in order to achieve our goals.</p><p></p><p>Overall, this group project was a valuable learning experience that has had a lasting impact on me as a student. It has helped me to develop important skills such as collaboration, communication, adaptability and creativity, which are essential for success in any field. I believe that this experience has helped to prepare me for future challenges and opportunities, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of it.</p><br />

That's because she was the teacher's daughter, and her mother made her. The other two, John and Eric, weren't really his friends, although they often ganged up with him against other kids to get their lunch money.</p><p></p><p>Jason knew he wouldn't have long to live. He could feel it, deep inside. Seeing his grandmother cry after talking with the doctor confirmed it. His time had come. He didn't tell his visitors, though. They would either pity him or be happy to get rid of him.</p><p></p><p>Once Martha left, he ripped a page off his notebook and wrote:</p><p></p><p>"Dear God, I know I messed up and nobody likes me. Please give me a second chance. I can show you what a good friend I can be."</p><p></p><p>He drew a map showing the way from the church to the hospital, walked shakily to the window, and let the balloon fly away, carrying his message toward God.</p><p></p><p>The balloon headed straight to a telephone pole, but a gentle breeze blew it away just in time. It crossed path with a duck family and disappeared out of view.</p><p></p><p>The next day, a girl he had never met before came to visit him. "I find balloon," she said. "You are lonely?"</p><p></p><p>He just nodded, too startled to talk.</p><p></p><p>"I lonely too. My family come from Afghanistan and I no speak English good." She smiled. "I bring gift to you." She handed him a box of chocolates. "I pray for friend, and God give me friend."</p><p></p><p>Normally, he would have made fun of her broken English and her long brown robe, but he knew better. He smiled and offered her the first chocolate.</p><p></p><br />
