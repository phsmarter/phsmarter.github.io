                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I was just a girl who lived an ordinary life. A life that I lived, I liked. I liked how my days are good, or when it's bad. I don't think much about guys, nor feel any intimacy with one. I'm not even scared of them—I just feel numb. I don't feel love, nor don't feel hate. I'm like someone who's both alive and dead. But not until I've gone through a hard time of my life.</p><p>There was a day where I got tired of the world. I've got tired of living my life, to the point where I wanted things to come to end. Surprisingly, he came into the background. He was like a sunlight that shined into my darkest days. He holds me close, keeps me safe—and I do feel safe. I feel like we can overcome the world when we're together. Funny, how things got so much easier for me. Things were great and good, and it feels nice. My feet were stumbling in a rock, but he's always there holding me up.</p><p>My story was miserable, not until he came into my life. He became my life, and I became his. We endured, love each other, and were able to pass the tests of this life. Even things are like these, I'm happy. I'm happy that he's around, and is always there to reach his hand and make me feel safe. I love him. And that's how our story goes.</p><p>cttro</p><p></p><br />

Why?10. Setting the life of Ephemera as an example, what would you tell the tree about happiness if you can talk to it? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Character trait of Ephemera helped itself to enjoy life by:</p><p></p><p>—Be Humble. The highest form of humility is the acceptance of our limitations – even if acknowledging our limitless potential – while unflinchingly recognizing the truth of humanity’s interdependence and our reliance on something or someone higher than us.</p><p>—Be Courageous. At exactly that point where courage falters, is the point at which all other character traits fail as well. In other words, courage is needed to nail every other character trait to the wall of integrity. Loving the loveable is easy. But loving the unlovable takes courage. Be Grateful. </p><p>—Be Tolerant. The truly happy are a tolerant bunch. They are tolerant of others’ mistakes. They are appropriately tolerant of their own. They tolerate the uncertainty of life. They don’t feel the need to control it or to control others.Be Loving. </p><p>—Be Forgiving. Forgiveness at its highest form is forgiveness broadly applied, as an expression of a forgiving heart. It is the attitude of forgiveness. It manifests itself even as the offense is taking place. It is spontaneous forgiveness. It’s the attitude of Gandhi to his jailors, and Jesus to his crucifiers.  And it is a character trait of the very deeply happy.</p><p>—Be Selfless. Selfishness is the great destroyer of love and compassion, of kindness, empathy and happiness. The problem is that it is also quite a natural part of the human condition.</p><p>—Be Honest. Be true to others. If you say you’ll do a thing, do it. If you’re not sure you’ll get to it, don’t say it. This builds credibility. Others will come to trust and respect you when they are confident your word is a stronger adhesive to action than a law suit is a disincentive to being dishonest. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>For number 8 Lang po yan, I hope makatulong</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A gale is a strong wind. Gale is like a burst of sound, especially of laughing.</p><p>2. The term is most commonly associated with maritime transportation. When visual navigation aids such as lighthouses are covered, foghorns offer an auditory warning of rock outcrops, shoals, headlands, or other risks to shipping.</p><p>3. In a storm, it is safer for a ship to be far out at sea since there are no rocks or shoreline for the ship to collide with.</p><p>4. Life at sea during the age of sail was difficult. Sailors had to accept cramped conditions, disease, poor food and pay, and bad weather.</p><p><strong>.Explanation:</strong></p><p>NOte : I really tried my best, and no it is not google.
