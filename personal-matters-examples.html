The same applies for calls after 11:00 P.M.c. Different parts of the day, for example, are highly significant in certain contexts,d. Our realization that time talks is even reflected in such common expressions as."What time does the clock say?"e. In the United States, if you telephone someone very early in the morning whilehe is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call usually signals a matter of utmostimportance and extreme urgency.f. A call received during sleeping hours is apt to be taken as a matter of life anddeath, hence the rude joke value of these calls among the young.That's a good start! Let's getdeeper. Are you ready to dothe next task? Good luck!​</a>

                                            Learning Task 3 Reading ComprehensionSolids, Liquids, and GasesMatter is basically a substance that takes up space. All matter is a solid, liquid, or gas, and they arecalled the states of matterEverywhere a person looks, there are examples of solids: desks, hairs, windows, rocks, tissues, andmuch more. Examples of liquids: water, milk, juice, chocolate sy up, soda, and others. Examples ofgases are harder to see, because they are invisible: the oxygen in the air, propane gas used for agrill, helium inside a balloon, and more.Everything, all matter, can be identified as a solid, liquid, or gas.Besides what they look like, there are many differences betwee i solids, liquids, and gases. Thesedifferences are called characteristics. The characteristics of each state of matter are different. Thesecharacteristics determine if a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas.A solid has a definite shape. It can be hard or soft, smooth or roi gh. Solids can come in all sizes. Asolid can be large like the Statue of Liberty, or small like a marble. It can be very tiny like a breadcrumb, or as big as a mountain, and everything in between. If snall enough, solids can be held in aperson's hand, and they are difficult to compress or push, or charge shape.The molecules of a solid are compact and close together, and nearly impossible to move throughA liquid takes the shape of the container it is held in, and will fil the bottom of a container. Liquidsusually have a smooth surface, but does not have a specific size. A person may be able to hold asmall amount of liquid in their hand, but a liquid cannot be held like a solid. Liquids are less difficult tocompress or push. It is much easier to move through a liquid thar a solid.The molecules of a liquid are spread out more than a solid, but less than a gas.Finally, a gas has ng shape, but can fill a container or any size or shape. It will fill an entire containeras the molecules move. A gas cannot be felt in the hands like a solid or liquid. It has no surface or noparticular size. It cannot be held in a person's hands, and it is easy to push or compress. A gas is theeasiest to move through versus a liquid or solid.The molecules in a gas are more spread out and move all the time. They are full of energy.Water is the best example of a substance that can be a solid, liqu d. or gas. Water by itself is a liquid.When water freezes it becomes a solid. If a container of water is h rated it turns into a gas called watervapor.There are many other substances that can be more than one type of matter too. Ice cream is solidthen turns into liquid, once melted. A moth ball is solid, but it rele: ses a gas that can be smelled by aperson inside the room.To summarize, the different states of matter are called solids, liqu ds, and gases. The states of matterhave different characteristics and examples of each can be found throughout the universe.Choose the letter of the correct answer.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>...</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Well as for me, there is no bad if you share your personal matter with your friends as long as it's your choice. And I don't think you will share that to them when you are not trusting them because personal matters are important and sharing it with your friends is a big decision. But if you feel guilty, then you should learn from it the next time. As for me, I also share my personal matters to my trusted friends because I know they value our friendship and sharing it with another is a different thing already when they know I trust them. So it is important when you make a certain decision regarding sharing personal matters to think of the possible consequences and if it is really worth sharing with that of your friends.</p><br />

                        Revising and editing are the two tasks you undertake to significantly improve your essay. Both are very important elements of the writing process. You may think that a completed first draft means that little improvement is needed. However, even experienced writers need to improve their drafts and rely on peers during revising and editing. You may know that athletes miss catches, fumble balls, or overshoot goals. Dancers forget steps, turn too slowly, or miss beats. For both athletes and dancers, the more they practise, the stronger their performance will become. Web designers seek better images, a more clever design, or a more appealing background for their web pages. Writing has the same capacity to profit from improvement and revision.<br />

Our realization that time talks is even reflected in such common expressions as."What time does the clock say?"e.

                            5. Learning Task 3 Reading ComprehensionSolids, Liquids, and GasesMatter is basically a substance that takes up space. All matter is a solid, liquid, or gas, and they arecalled the states of matterEverywhere a person looks, there are examples of solids: desks, hairs, windows, rocks, tissues, andmuch more. Examples of liquids: water, milk, juice, chocolate sy up, soda, and others. Examples ofgases are harder to see, because they are invisible: the oxygen in the air, propane gas used for agrill, helium inside a balloon, and more.Everything, all matter, can be identified as a solid, liquid, or gas.Besides what they look like, there are many differences betwee i solids, liquids, and gases. Thesedifferences are called characteristics. The characteristics of each state of matter are different. Thesecharacteristics determine if a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas.A solid has a definite shape. It can be hard or soft, smooth or roi gh. Solids can come in all sizes. Asolid can be large like the Statue of Liberty, or small like a marble. It can be very tiny like a breadcrumb, or as big as a mountain, and everything in between. If snall enough, solids can be held in aperson's hand, and they are difficult to compress or push, or charge shape.The molecules of a solid are compact and close together, and nearly impossible to move throughA liquid takes the shape of the container it is held in, and will fil the bottom of a container. Liquidsusually have a smooth surface, but does not have a specific size. A person may be able to hold asmall amount of liquid in their hand, but a liquid cannot be held like a solid. Liquids are less difficult tocompress or push. It is much easier to move through a liquid thar a solid.The molecules of a liquid are spread out more than a solid, but less than a gas.Finally, a gas has ng shape, but can fill a container or any size or shape. It will fill an entire containeras the molecules move. A gas cannot be felt in the hands like a solid or liquid. It has no surface or noparticular size. It cannot be held in a person's hands, and it is easy to push or compress. A gas is theeasiest to move through versus a liquid or solid.The molecules in a gas are more spread out and move all the time. They are full of energy.Water is the best example of a substance that can be a solid, liqu d. or gas. Water by itself is a liquid.When water freezes it becomes a solid. If a container of water is h rated it turns into a gas called watervapor.There are many other substances that can be more than one type of matter too. Ice cream is solidthen turns into liquid, once melted. A moth ball is solid, but it rele: ses a gas that can be smelled by aperson inside the room.To summarize, the different states of matter are called solids, liqu ds, and gases. The states of matterhave different characteristics and examples of each can be found throughout the universe.Choose the letter of the correct answer.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Revising and editing are the two tasks you undertake to significantly improve your essay. Both are very important elements of the writing process. You may think that a completed first draft means that little improvement is needed. However, even experienced writers need to improve their drafts and rely on peers during revising and editing. You may know that athletes miss catches, fumble balls, or overshoot goals. Dancers forget steps, turn too slowly, or miss beats. For both athletes and dancers, the more they practise, the stronger their performance will become. Web designers seek better images, a more clever design, or a more appealing background for their web pages. Writing has the same capacity to profit from improvement and revision.</p><p></p><p>You should revise and edit in stages: do not expect to catch everything in one go. If each time you review your essay you focus on a different aspect of construction, you will be more likely to catch any mistakes or identify any issues. Throughout this chapter, you will see a number of checklists containing specific things to look for with each revision. For example, you will first look at how the overall paper and your ideas are organized.</p><p></p><p>In the second section of this chapter, you will focus more on editing: correcting the mechanical issues. Also at the end of the chapter, you will see a comprehensive but more general list of things you should be looking for.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the Purpose of Revising and Editing</p><p></p><p>Revising and editing allow you to examine two important aspects of your writing separately, so that you can give each task your undivided attention.</p><p></p><p>When you revise, you take a second look at your ideas. You might add, cut, move, or change information in order to make your ideas clearer, more accurate, more interesting, or more convincing.</p><p></p><p>When you edit, you take a second look at how you expressed your ideas. You add or change words. You fix any problems in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. You improve your writing style. You make your essay into a polished, mature piece of writing, the end product of your best efforts.</p><p></p><p>Tip</p><p></p><p>How do you get the best out of your revisions and editing? Here are some strategies that writers have developed to look at their first drafts from a fresh perspective. Try them throughout the writing process; then keep using the ones that bring results.</p><p></p><p>Take a break. You are proud of what you wrote, but you might be too close to it to make changes. Set aside your writing for a few hours or even a day until you can look at it objectively.</p><p></p><p>Ask someone you trust for feedback and constructive criticism.</p><p></p><p>Pretend you are one of your readers. Are you satisfied or dissatisfied? Why?</p><p></p><p>For many people, the words critic, critical, and criticism provoke only negative feelings that make them blush, grumble, or shout. However, as a writer and a thinker, you need to learn to be critical of yourself in a positive way and have high expectations for your work. You also need to train your eye and trust your ability to fix what needs fixing. To do this, you need to teach yourself where to look.</p><p></p><p>Revising Your Paper: Organization, Cohesion, and Unity</p><p></p><p>When writing a research paper, it is easy to become overly focused on editorial details, such as the proper format for bibliographical entries. These details do matter. However, before you begin to address them, it is important to spend time reviewing and revising the content of the paper.</p><p></p><p>A good research paper is both organized and cohesive. Organization means that your argument flows logically from one point to the next. Cohesion means that the elements of your paper work together smoothly and naturally. In a cohesive research paper, information from research is seamlessly integrated with the writer’s ideas.</p><p></p><p>Revise to Improve Organization</p><p></p><p>When you revise to improve organization, you look at the flow of ideas throughout the essay as a whole and within individual paragraphs. You check to see that your essay moves logically from the introduction to the body paragraphs to the conclusion, and that each section reinforces your thesis. Use Checklist 12.1: </p><p></p><br />

The use of series of example to support an opinion provides better understanding on the t ofthe listener or reader.6. To make stronger opinion, never consider the contradicting view of others.7.
