                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is true that trees help to clean the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis. However, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a virus that spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. While air pollution can contribute to respiratory problems, COVID-19 is not caused by air pollution. It is important to follow guidelines from health experts to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I would like to point out that the statement you provided seems to be a mix of various claims that are not necessarily connected.</p><p></p><p>While trees do play an important role in purifying the air, it is not accurate to say that all trees are grown up in 10 to 20 years. The rate of growth and the time it takes for trees to mature depend on several factors, such as the species of the tree, the climate, soil quality, and other environmental factors.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, while good air quality can help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, it is not accurate to say that the virus comes directly from coughing or sneezing into the air. COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets that are expelled when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Therefore, wearing masks and practicing social distancing are important measures to help prevent the spread of the virus.</p><br />
