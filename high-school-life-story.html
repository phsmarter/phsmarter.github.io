LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

I don't have any trauma or diagnosed or something. I once got mental blocked because some transferee asked for directions and I can't answer them straight so in the end he just smirked at me and called me a mute. I could never explain where my anxieties came from, my parents were a social butterflies while their youngest over here can't even have an eye contact with people. So I guess I cant say that it runs from the blood huh? I always search in internet how to get rid of anxieties especially in a middle of a recitation, it never worked anyway, and now I'm still here doing my best to get rid of this anxiety and soon be able to at least have an interaction with some classmates I guess.</p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><br />

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.
