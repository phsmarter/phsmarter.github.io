                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>n school, students indeed experience bullying. May it be offensive words of one's physicality, misunderstanding of words or body language, misjudged, etc.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are three things to consider in a situation of a bully and the victim. We must not forget also the bystander. In my opinion, it is the worst of them all. Why? Because a bystander in a situation like this doesn't care at all, a bystander doesn't care if you're bullied or not. A bystander who doesn't report to the principal's office or stand up for the victim. This type does apply to many, which makes us look like hypocrites. Why hypocrites? Because we're similar to what the bully is doing to the victim. As a matter of fact, not everyone is going to be the bully intentionally but not everyone is going to be the victim. Life is full of choices, you either choose what you're going to do because it's your life. What you do today will affect someone's life, may it be good or bad. What you don't do today will not affect you but you will lose something.
</p><p>
</p><p>How to avoid being a bystander, a bully and a victim of bullying? First, you need to respect yourself first. Why? Because if you know how to respect yourself, you will also know how to respect others. Second, you need to accept people's corrections without lashing out. Lastly, love God before loving yourself, because God is the whole definition of love.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>nabasa ko lng po</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying is a pervasive issue that affects many individuals, especially children and teenagers. It is defined as repeated aggressive behavior intended to harm or intimidate another person. Bullying can take many forms, including physical, verbal, and emotional abuse. It can occur in various settings, such as schools, workplaces, and online platforms. In the Philippines, bullying is a serious concern that has prompted the government to enact laws to protect victims.</p><p>The Anti-Bullying Act of 2013 (Republic Act No. 10627) is the primary law in the Philippines that addresses the issue of bullying. The law defines bullying as any severe or repeated use by one or more students of a written, verbal, or electronic expression, or a physical act or gesture, or any combination thereof, directed at another student that has the effect of actually causing or placing the latter in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to his property; creating a hostile environment at school for the other student; infringing on the rights of the other student at school; or materially and substantially disrupting the education process or the orderly operation of a school.</p><p>Under this law, schools are required to establish policies and procedures to prevent and address bullying incidents. These policies should include measures for reporting and investigating incidents of bullying, providing support for victims and their families, and imposing appropriate sanctions for offenders. Schools are also mandated to conduct programs that promote awareness and understanding of bullying among students, teachers, and parents.</p><p>In conclusion, bullying is a serious issue that can have long-lasting effects on its victims. The Philippines recognizes this problem and has taken steps to address it through the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013. This law provides a framework for schools to prevent and respond to incidents of bullying effectively. However, it is essential to continue promoting awareness and education about this issue to prevent it from happening in the first place.</p><br />

This risk can be increased further when these kids are not supported by parents, peers, and schools. Bullying can make an unsupportive situation worse.</p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps po :))</p><p></p><br />

                        What are the roles of us as teachers to lessen the bullying? Not all of the students are in charge of adjusting when it comes to bullying. We, facilitators, also help to lessen the bullying cases as we discipline our pupils or students. Every teachers should be a role model to their students whom they are teaching. We are not just enhancing the comprehension, reading, writing, speaking, grammar, mathematical, or any acdemic- related skills that we should know and learn as we accelerate to upper levels of learning and dreaming, we also enhance and improve our students' values.<br /><br />As a teacher, these are the things we are intended to do. We do facilitate and monitor our classes and the students who belong in our classes we are monitoring. To lessen bullying, we always watch them wherever they go even though we're no there physically, we still manage to monitor by installing cameras around the school and within its premises. We also track the records of those who are bullying and being bullied, however, the numbers of those who are reporting to us that are being bullied are decreasing mainly because of threats by their bullies and ends up being bullied continuously and consequently. However, although not yet implemented or probably implemented by other schools, we can use social media for the bullied ones to share experience and gain justice and alleviate the bullies in their lives. They will be anonymously known so that no one will know their identity.<br /><br />Those are just some of the ways that are possible to achieve so that we can lessen and alleviate the percentage of bullying cases in our country. I do believe that the government will help us solve this problem. As a conclusion, we should help each other because if only one will work then the problem will not be solved the way it should be. We should practice and impose unity between the students and us, teachers, for us to be able to surpass this kind of grave situation.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Bullying is a pervasive issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. It can take many forms, including physical, verbal, and psychological abuse. The negative impact of bullying can be long-lasting and far-reaching, leading to a range of physical, emotional, and social problems for both victims and perpetrators. In this essay, we will explore the issues surrounding bullying, including its causes, effects, and potential solutions.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Bullying can have a significant impact on the mental and emotional health of its victims. Those who experience bullying may suffer from anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. They may also have difficulty forming and maintaining healthy relationships with others, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. In extreme cases, bullying can even lead to self-harm or suicide.</p><p></p><p>While victims are clearly the primary targets of bullying, perpetrators can also suffer from a range of negative consequences. Those who engage in bullying behavior may struggle with feelings of guilt, shame, and regret, which can impact their self-esteem and sense of self-worth. They may also experience social ostracism and exclusion from their peers, as others may view them as aggressive or mean-spirited.</p><p></p><p>The causes of bullying are complex and multifaceted, but often stem from a range of personal, social, and environmental factors. These can include a lack of empathy, a desire for power and control, a learned behavior, and personal issues like low self-esteem. Addressing these underlying factors is key to developing effective solutions to the issue of bullying.</p><p></p><p>There are several potential solutions to the problem of bullying, including prevention programs, increased education and awareness, and stronger disciplinary measures for those who engage in bullying behavior. Prevention programs can help to create a culture of empathy, respect, and inclusivity, while education and awareness campaigns can help to reduce the stigma surrounding bullying and increase understanding of its impact. Stronger disciplinary measures can also serve as a deterrent for those who engage in bullying behavior, making it clear that this type of behavior will not be tolerated.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, bullying is a pervasive issue that has a far-reaching impact on individuals and communities. While the causes of bullying are complex and multifaceted, addressing the underlying factors is essential for developing effective solutions. By working together to create a culture of empathy, respect, and inclusivity, we can reduce the prevalence of bullying and ensure that all individuals are able to live healthy, happy, and fulfilling lives.   pa brainliest po sobrang tagal nito itype </p><br />

                        <br />     In school, students indeed experience bullying. May it be offensive words of one's physicality, misunderstanding of words or body language, misjudged, etc.<br /><br />    There are three things to consider in a situation of a bully and the victim. We must not forget also the bystander. In my opinion, it is the worst of them all. Why? Because a bystander in a situation like this doesn't care at all, a bystander doesn't care if you're bullied or not. A bystander who doesn't report to the principal's office or stand up for the victim. This type does apply to many, which makes us look like hypocrites. Why hypocrites? Because we're similar to what the bully is doing to the victim. As a matter of fact, not everyone is going to be the bully intentionally but not everyone is going to be the victim. Life is full of choices, you either choose what you're going to do because it's your life. What you do today will affect someone's life, may it be good or bad. What you don't do today will not affect you but you will lose something. <br /><br />    How to avoid being a bystander, a bully and a victim of bullying? First, you need to respect yourself first. Why? Because if you know how to respect yourself, you will also know how to respect others. Second, you need to accept people's corrections without lashing out. Lastly,  love God before loving yourself, because God is the whole definition of love. <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying  Can  Be  Prevented Bullying is a form of violence to pick on victims because they are different from their bullies, have insecurity/jealousy or home problems. The hate towards their victim has something to do with the victim having an unusual gift or being intelligent the bullies has yet to become. It is important that this behavior should be prevented or it will become worse. Bullying is one of the main issues public and private schools have to face on a day-to-day basis. When the bully takes it too far, the victim snaps and retaliates by fighting him/her back physically or verbally. Not  many  victims  does  this  for  fear  of  retaliation; nonetheless  some  victims  are  brave  enough  to  fight  back. The effects of bullying will affect the victim’s future as they grow up to become adults. If this issue continues, he/she has a right to report the incident or fight back their bullies. All forms of bullying, including cyber-bullying, are considered intolerable and criminal at school. Bullying occurs when the bully fights or insults the victims to the point of fighting back or seeking help from someone trustworthy to prevent their issue of being bullied.  First, problems of the victim who face bullying can go worse when the bully torment the victim into feeling less confident. He/she will feel alone, not going to school, becoming sick or thoughts of suicide. Furthermore, students who cyber-bully or is self-involved bullies</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
