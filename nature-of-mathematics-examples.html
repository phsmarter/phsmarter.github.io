SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane?

THEORY
THEORY is an idea that is suggested or presented as possibly true but that is not known proven or to be true.THEORY is also a well sustained explanation acquired through scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through explanations observations and experimentation.
Example:
Alfred Weneger,shown her on a trip to Greenland in 1912-1913 proposed his ideas about continental drift as early as 1912,a concept later incorporated into the revolutionary theory of plate tectonics
LAW:
LAW describes the behavior of nature the universe under certain conditions usually expressed as in a mathematical equations.Law is also a statement based on repeatedly experimental observation that describes some aspects of the universe.
EXAMPLE OF LAW:
Newton's second law of motion can be formally stated as follows:The Accelaration of an object as produced by a net force is directly Proportional to the magnitude of the net force,and inversely proportional to the mass of the object</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Fibonacci sequence</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>The idea follows the observation that nature is full of patterns, such as the Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. A few examples include the number of spirals in a pine cone, pineapple or seeds in a sunflower, or the number of petals on a flower. The numbers in this sequence also form a a unique shape known as a Fibonacci spiral, which again, we see in nature in the form of shells and the shape of hurricanes.</p>Snake?

                            27. Unit 1. SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on.

EXAMPLE:
Null Hypothesis (Written in Negative Form)
Example of Null Hypothesis: plants dont need sun to grow
Affirmative/Alternative Hypothesis(Written in Positive Form)
Example of Affirmative Hypothesis:Plants need sun to grow
THEORY
THEORY is an idea that is suggested or presented as possibly true but that is not known proven or to be true.THEORY is also a well sustained explanation acquired through scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through explanations observations and experimentation.
Example:
Alfred Weneger,shown her on a trip to Greenland in 1912-1913 proposed his ideas about continental drift as early as 1912,a concept later incorporated into the revolutionary theory of plate tectonics
LAW:
LAW describes the behavior of nature the universe under certain conditions usually expressed as in a mathematical equations.Law is also a statement based on repeatedly experimental observation that describes some aspects of the universe.
EXAMPLE OF LAW:
Newton's second law of motion can be formally stated as follows:The Accelaration of an object as produced by a net force is directly Proportional to the magnitude of the net force,and inversely proportional to the mass of the object</h2><br />
                        That's right! And hypothesis should be testable and must be proven<br />
