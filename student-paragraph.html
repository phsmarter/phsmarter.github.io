                            7. What is you New Normal Learning as your Students? minimum in 3 paragraph and maximum 5 paragraph​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>For the new normal in education, assessments and grades should be reviewed and reimagined so that they continue to be relevant to students. Schools should deeply think about their purposes and priorities in designing assessments or grading students. Beyond making students accountable for their own learning, educators should also bear in mind that in times of emergency remote learning, the higher call probably is to continue encouraging and supporting student learning. One way of doing this is to continuously give students feedback on their learning which can help them reflect on their strengths and find ways to improve themselves further. Eventually, teacher’s feedback serves as verification until students finally “get the lesson.”</p><p></p><p>Educators agree that grades should reflect what students have learned and can do. However, at this time of the new normal, grades can also cause frustration and anxiety, especially in students whose academic performance may have “suffered” due to factors that are out of their control. Hence, educators are called to practice flexibility in allowing students who are deeply and validly affected by the pandemic to finish their requirements when they are ready and capable of doing so. Educators can also focus more on mastery of learning and adopt grades that demonstrate or indicate mastery of knowledge and skills, or lack thereof. Schools can also be clearer in their criteria of mastery of learning while still maintaining their standards. Teachers can then help students achieve these criteria by constantly giving them feedback. In the end, grades may still be given, but with much fairness, compassion, and flexibility.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The pandemic has highlighted the big gap among schools in terms of equity, access, and support for teachers, students, and education, in general. Some schools quickly responded to the school closures because they had better access to digital technologies and more teachers who are trained and equipped with the skills needed in teaching with technology. </p><br />

                            8. three-paragraph insight about the "challenges of the students in this time of pandemic". three(3) paragraph consists of 5 sentences.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The challenges of students during this pandemic are immense. Many students are struggling to keep up with their studies and their daily work, as their education is largely taking place online. The lack of physical contact with teachers and peers, as well as the lack of resources in their homes, means that the learning experience has been greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>The lack of access to resources is a major obstacle for students. Many students lack access to computers, or to the internet, making it difficult or impossible for them to access the necessary materials for their studies. Furthermore, students often lack the resources to pay for the materials they need, or even for the classes they need to take. This leaves them at a major disadvantage compared to those who have more access to resources.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the emotional impact of the pandemic on students is something that needs to be addressed. Many students are experiencing increased levels of anxiety and depression, as well as other mental health issues. The lack of social interaction, the disruption to their education, and the uncertainty of the future can all have a negative impact on students’ mental health. It is important that students have access to mental health support and counseling during this difficult time.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted negatively on the global education system. Students face a variety of challenges, such as the transition to online learning, limited access to technology, and a lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. For many students who are unfamiliar with the technology used for distance learning, online learning has been a significant challenge. Many students have found it difficult to navigate online platforms on their own.</p><p></p><p>Another issue that students face during this pandemic is a lack of access to technology. Because not all students have access to laptops, computers, or reliable internet connections, participating in online learning is difficult. This situation is especially difficult for students from low-income families, who may lack the resources to purchase the necessary equipment for remote learning. This lack of access to technology may worsen academic achievement inconsistencies among students.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, during the pandemic, students faced significant challenges due to a lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. Students miss out on the advantages of face-to-face interactions with teachers and peers, such as immediate feedback and socialization. In the absence of these interactions, students' emotional and mental well-being may suffer, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. As a result, it is critical that students have access to support systems to address their social and emotional needs during this trying time.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps</p><br />
