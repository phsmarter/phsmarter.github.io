                                            What is quantitative research?By definition, quantitative research is an objective, systematic empiricalinvestigation of observable phenomena through the use of computational techniques. Ithighlights numerical analysis of data hoping that the numbers yield unbiased results thatcan be generalized to some larger population and explain a particular observation(Faltado III et al., 2016)Moreover, Baraceros (2016) expounded that expressions like numerical forms,objective thinking, statistical methods, and measurement signal the existence ofquantitative research. It involves measurements and amounts and seeks to find answersto questions how many, how much, how long, to what extent and the like.Finding out how many students eat at the school canteen every lunch time, or howmuch allowance do senior high school students have every day is quantitative.Quantitative vs. QualitativeSo, how is quantitative research different from qualitative research? One word thatreflects the true nature of quantitative research is numerical. On the other hand,qualitative is subjective, interpretive, exploratory and requires heavy narratives.To be more specific, quantitative research deals with numbers, collects data whichcan be measured like length, height, area, volume, weight, speed, time, temperature,humidity, sound levels, costs, members, ages, scores, etc. while qualitative research dealswith description, and collects data which can be observed but not measured like colors,textures, smells, tastes, appearance, beauty, etc.Thus, you conduct a qualitative research when you want to know the commonthemes in Shakespeare's works but you conduct a quantitative research when you want toknow how many sonnets and plays he wrote.You employ quantitative research in finding out the IQ levels of the Grade 7students; however, you do qualitative research in describing the hardships andchallenges faced by the working students.Think about a headline you read from a newspaper, listened from a radio orwatched from the television. Ask 5 quantitative questions about it.​</a>

                            9. What is quantitative research?By definition, quantitative research is an objective, systematic empiricalinvestigation of observable phenomena through the use of computational techniques. Ithighlights numerical analysis of data hoping that the numbers yield unbiased results thatcan be generalized to some larger population and explain a particular observation(Faltado III et al., 2016)Moreover, Baraceros (2016) expounded that expressions like numerical forms,objective thinking, statistical methods, and measurement signal the existence ofquantitative research. It involves measurements and amounts and seeks to find answersto questions how many, how much, how long, to what extent and the like.Finding out how many students eat at the school canteen every lunch time, or howmuch allowance do senior high school students have every day is quantitative.Quantitative vs. QualitativeSo, how is quantitative research different from qualitative research? One word thatreflects the true nature of quantitative research is numerical. On the other hand,qualitative is subjective, interpretive, exploratory and requires heavy narratives.To be more specific, quantitative research deals with numbers, collects data whichcan be measured like length, height, area, volume, weight, speed, time, temperature,humidity, sound levels, costs, members, ages, scores, etc. while qualitative research dealswith description, and collects data which can be observed but not measured like colors,textures, smells, tastes, appearance, beauty, etc.Thus, you conduct a qualitative research when you want to know the commonthemes in Shakespeare's works but you conduct a quantitative research when you want toknow how many sonnets and plays he wrote.You employ quantitative research in finding out the IQ levels of the Grade 7students; however, you do qualitative research in describing the hardships andchallenges faced by the working students.Think about a headline you read from a newspaper, listened from a radio orwatched from the television. Ask 5 quantitative questions about it.​</h2><br />

Hermeneutic Analysis</p><p></p><p></p>About phenomenology<p> <strong>Phenomenology</strong> is a study in terms of philosophy that studies human as a phenomenon.  The <strong>science</strong> of phenomonology in philosophy is usually associated with the science of hermeneutics, namely the science that studies the benefits of this phenomenon.</p><p></p><p> This term was first introduced by <strong>Johann Heinrich Lambert</strong> (1728 - 1777), a German philosopher.  In his book Neues Organon (1764).  he wrote about unreal knowledge.</p><p></p><p> In the literary approach, <strong>phenomenology</strong> uses the intuitive experience of phenomena, something that has a phenomenological reflection, as a starting point and effort to get to the nature of experience and the nature of what we experience.  G.W.F.  Hegel and Edmund Husserl are two important figures in the development of this philosophical approach.</p><p></p><p> The <strong>phenomenological tradition</strong> concentrates on personal experience including the realm of individuals who actually share experiences with one another.  Communication is seen as a round of sharing experiences or information between individuals through discussion.  Good relations between individuals have a high position in this tradition.  In this tradition, it is said that language represents a meaning for objects.  So, just one word can give meaning to something that will be interpreted.</p><p></p><p> Fundamentally, phenomenology is a tradition of study used to explore human experience.  As stated by Littlejohn that phenomenology is a tradition to explore human experience.  In this <strong>context</strong>, the assumption is correct that humans actively understand the world around them as a life experience and actively interpret that experience.</p><p> The main <strong>assumption</strong> of phenomenology is that humans actively interpret their experiences by providing a formula for something they experience.  Therefore interpretation is an active process to provide a formula for something that is experienced by humans.  In other words understanding is a creative action, namely action towards meaning.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>phenomenology</strong> at https://brainly.ph/question/987790.</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
