                                            Essay 1: Importance of Education Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training it can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check-ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards   SUMMARIZES​</a>

                            4. Essay 1: Importance of Education Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training it can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check-ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards   SUMMARIZES​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Globalization is the word used to describe the growing interdependence of the world’s economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information. Countries have built economic partnerships to facilitate these movements over many centuries. This guide uses the term more narrowly to refer to international trade and some of the investment flows among advanced economies, mostly focusing on the United States. The wide-ranging effects of globalization are complex and politically charged. As with major technological advances, globalization benefits society as a whole, while harming certain groups. Understanding the relative costs and benefits can pave the way for alleviating problems while sustaining the wider payoffs.Globalization decrease the cost of manufacturing. This means that companies can offer goods at a lower price to consumers. Ang Average cost ng mga goods ay isang mahalagang aspeto na nag-aambag sa pagtaas sa pamantayan ng pamumuhay. Ang mga consumers ay mayroon ding access sa mas malawak na iba't ibang mga goods. Social and economic factors, such as income, education, employment, community safety, and social supports can significally affect how well and how long we live. These factors affect our ability to make healthy choices, afford medical care and housing, and manage stress and more. Economist generally agree that economic development and growth are influenced by four factors: human resources, physical capital, natural capital, natural resources and technology. Highly developed na bansa na naka focus sa mga lugar na ito. Ang mga hindi gaanong maunlad na countries, even those with high amounts ofnatural resources, will lag behind when they fail to promote research in technology at improve nila ang skills at education ng mga kanilang manggagawa dahil ang mga skills at education at training ng mga labor force ay may direct effect on the growth of an economy. A skilled, well trained workforce ay more productive at magpoproduce ng high-quality output that adds efficiency to an economy. Shortage ng skilled labor ay pwede pababain ang economic growth ng isang bansa at under-utilized, illiterate and unskilled workforce will become a drag on an economy and may possibly lead to higher unemploymen</p><br />

Reports indicated that mayors and governors were given quotas for “yes” votes on the constitution and negative votes were often not recorded.[3] Results report that 90 percent of the citizens have voted for the constitution even though some communities did not participate in the “citizens assemblies.”[4] Over the next few years, Marcos would hold four more plebiscites—in 1973, 1975, 1976, and 1978—through citizen assemblies to legitimize the continuation of martial rule</p><p> </p><p>bwhwwhehejnr</p><br />
