Clean and Safe Water Water that comes from a protected source - a well, a tap, or an enclosed spring - is often both clean and safe, if the source is well- maintained. Water that comes from a pond, stream, lake, or river may look clean but it is not necessarily safe. The water may have germs in it even if it looks clean. There may be other locally relevant ways in which people in your communities clean and purify water. It is important to use locally sustainable methods, if they are safe and advised by health workers. Even if your water comes from a protected source, it is good practice to treat your water by boiling it, heating it in the sun, filtering, or adding chlorine to it-just to be sure! Everyone should drink safe water all the time. It is essential that young children especially under five years old are given only safe drinking water.​</a>

Water that comes from a pond, stream, lake, or river may look clean but it is not necessarily safe. The water may have germs in it even if it looks clean. There may be other locally relevant ways in which people in your communities clean and purify water. It is important to use locally sustainable methods, if they are safe and advised by health workers. Even if your water comes from a protected source, it is good practice to treat your water by boiling it, heating it in the sun, filtering, or adding chlorine to it – just to be sure! Everyone should drink safe water all the time. It is essential that young children especially under five years old are given only safe drinking water.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p></p><p>Climate change is a complex global phenomenon that has been a subject of scientific and political debates for decades. It is characterized by the gradual rise in global temperatures, sea level rise, melting of glaciers, and extreme weather events. Climate change poses a significant threat to the global ecosystem, human health, and economies. For this reason, climate change has become a critical topic of research across various fields, including environmental studies, economics, engineering, and public policy.</p><p></p><p>Despite the extensive research on climate change, there is still much to understand about the dynamics of this phenomenon, particularly from a local perspective. This study aims to address this gap in knowledge by examining the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity in rural areas of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines, a developing country located in Southeast Asia, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to its geographical location, topography, and dependence on agriculture as a means of livelihood. Like many developing countries, the Philippines faces climate-related challenges such as erratic rainfall, droughts, and intense typhoons, which have a significant impact on agricultural production.</p><p></p><p>This study seeks to test the hypothesis that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity in the Philippines. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will collect data from farmers and agricultural experts in the rural areas of the Philippines to measure the impact of climate change on crop yields, land productivity, and farmers’ incomes.</p><p></p><p>Through this study, we hope to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity, particularly in developing country contexts. The findings of this study will inform policymakers and make recommendations aimed at mitigating the negative effects of climate change on agriculture in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>If correct mark me as brainiest nalang </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>The act of recycling has become an essential aspect of environmental conservation. Over the years, significant amounts of waste produced from households and industries have had severe implications on the environment. To combat this issue, numerous governments and organizations have implemented recycling programs that help reduce the effects of waste on the environment. However, due to the rapidly growing population and the constantly changing waste composition, several problems have been encountered in the recycling process. </p><p></p><p>The objective of this study is to investigate the challenges faced by the recycling industry in efficiently managing waste within the urban areas. The study will examine the factors that affect the recycling process, including collection, sorting, transportation, and disposal of waste. Additionally, this study aims to identify possible solutions to improve waste management and enhance the effectiveness of the recycling process. </p><p></p><p>To achieve this objective, we will first review the current literature discussing the recycling process and the challenges faced in managing waste. We will analyze different approaches and methods used by various governments and organizations in implementing recycling programs. Additionally, we will identify gaps in the current literature regarding waste management and propose ways in which our research can address these gaps. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, this study proposes a theoretical framework that will guide our research. The framework is based on the principles of the Circular Economy, where waste is viewed as a valuable resource rather than a nuisance. We hypothesize that the adoption of circular economy principles can contribute to the efficient management of waste, resulting in more effective recycling processes. </p><p></p><p>The research methods will involve data collection through surveys, interviews, and site visits to observe the current waste management practices. A quantitative approach will be employed to analyze the collected data, and the results will contribute to the development of recommendations for improving waste management practices.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, this study seeks to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by addressing the gaps in waste management, proposing suitable solutions that can improve the recycling process. By adopting circular economy principles, we hope to provide insight into a more sustainable and efficient method of waste management.</p><p></p><p><strong>Feedback</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>If my answer is Correct and you like it, make me as brainiest </p><br />

Clean and Safe Water Water that comes from a protected source - a well, a tap, or an enclosed spring - is often both clean and safe, if the source is well- maintained. Water that comes from a pond, stream, lake, or river may look clean but it is not necessarily safe. The water may have germs in it even if it looks clean. There may be other locally relevant ways in which people in your communities clean and purify water. It is important to use locally sustainable methods, if they are safe and advised by health workers. Even if your water comes from a protected source, it is good practice to treat your water by boiling it, heating it in the sun, filtering, or adding chlorine to it-just to be sure! Everyone should drink safe water all the time. It is essential that young children especially under five years old are given only safe drinking water.​</h2><br />

Water that comes from a pond, stream, lake, or river may look clean but it is not necessarily safe. The water may have germs in it even if it looks clean. There may be other locally relevant ways in which people in your communities clean and purify water. It is important to use locally sustainable methods, if they are safe and advised by health workers. Even if your water comes from a protected source, it is good practice to treat your water by boiling it, heating it in the sun, filtering, or adding chlorine to it – just to be sure! Everyone should drink safe water all the time. It is essential that young children especially under five years old are given only safe drinking water.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Water is a highly essential part of life itself. Not only does it affect humans but it is also a very important part of the environment. Water is used for everyday uses such as showering, using the bathroom, washing dishes or other items around the house. It also is what keeps us hydrated and affects our internal functions such as digestion. Without water, plants, animals, and humans would die out. Although, not everyone has the pleasure of having access to clean water.</p><p></p><p>second ans:</p><p>Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries' economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>the concept map po is sa second pic</p><br />
