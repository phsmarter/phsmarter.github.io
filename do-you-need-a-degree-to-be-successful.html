                    <p>Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                                            Hindrance of Dynamism     
 Scenario:  
A man doesn’t see passion or interest in what he does, this is the main reason why he fails to progress forward, learn and love what he does. He only perseveres because people around him push him and believes that he will be successful on this track.   
 One good example of this is College life. Most of our loved ones urge us to complete and finish a degree but some failed to see the future benefit of it. Some fail to take the course that they really want because of lack of money and they are forced to get any college course just to compensate for the life requirement of having a degree to be fit and be able to compete in the employment world where in you need to work to be able live.     
Questions:  
How should this man address this issue of his to be successful in life knowing that he is on a track that does not let him enjoy himself and he is just forced to do so just comply with the urge of those around him? 
 Do you think if he focuses on the details of what he does he will be able to start to like and love it?   </a>

Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out so that he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system for personal computers. He invented (DOS) Disk operating system) and founded Microsoft. In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highest level of education that their potential and effort allow. It's great to have some college experience, because it exposes you to new people and ideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year university education.

                                            Activity 5. If you have successfully answered the above exercises, then you are ready for a more challenging one. ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</a>

                                            In this task, you'll consider the Cold War from the perspective of a hardliner and the perspective of a diplomacy advocate. You'll read two sources and consider the point of view of each author. How might the authors' perspectives influence their thinking on how to approach the Soviet Union
...Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison for contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason, they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact between [the] Western world and their own, feared what would happen if Russians learned [the] truth about [the] world without or if foreigners learned [the] truth about [the] world within. And they have learned to seek security only in patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of rival power, never in compacts and compromises with it.
Soviet power, unlike that of Hitlerite Germany, is neither schematic nor adventuristic. It does not work by fixed plans. It does not take unnecessary risks. Impervious to logic of reason, and it is highly sensitive to logic of force. For this reason, it can easily withdraw—and usually does—when strong resistance is encountered at any point. Thus, if the adversary has sufficient force and makes clear his readiness to use it, he rarely has to do so. If situations are properly handled, there need be no prestige-engaging showdowns. Gauged against [the] Western world as a whole, Soviets are still by far the weaker force. Thus, their success will really depend on degree of cohesion, firmness, and vigor which [the] Western world can muster. And this is [a] factor which it is within our power to influence.
(George Kennan, "The Long Telegram," 1946)
Now think about the contrasting points of view that were expressed in the two excerpts you've read. Use the annotations you've made in each excerpt to help you complete the table.
TIP: Remember, as you fill out each column, you're writing from the perspective of a hardliner or a diplomacy advocate, NOT as yourself. Write the answers you believe they would write them.

They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                            2. Hindrance of Dynamism     
 Scenario:  
A man doesn’t see passion or interest in what he does, this is the main reason why he fails to progress forward, learn and love what he does. He only perseveres because people around him push him and believes that he will be successful on this track.   
 One good example of this is College life. Most of our loved ones urge us to complete and finish a degree but some failed to see the future benefit of it. Some fail to take the course that they really want because of lack of money and they are forced to get any college course just to compensate for the life requirement of having a degree to be fit and be able to compete in the employment world where in you need to work to be able live.     
Questions:  
How should this man address this issue of his to be successful in life knowing that he is on a track that does not let him enjoy himself and he is just forced to do so just comply with the urge of those around him? 
 Do you think if he focuses on the details of what he does he will be able to start to like and love it?   </h2><br />

Write your answer in the box provided.                Some people believe that everyone     needs a college degree. Education is important, but I don't think a four-year university education is needed to be successful in our society. Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized training in their fields. They don't need to be college graduates to do their work. Blue collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be if no one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog our sinks? The college- educated professional won't do it. Unskilled work is important too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a high school education, but many people rely on the services they provide. On the other hand, a practical education combined with college courses in business administration might mean the difference between being an electrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. Bill Gates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when he was in high school.

                            6. Activity 5. If you have successfully answered the above exercises, then you are ready for a more challenging one. ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</h2><br />

                            7. In this task, you'll consider the Cold War from the perspective of a hardliner and the perspective of a diplomacy advocate. You'll read two sources and consider the point of view of each author. How might the authors' perspectives influence their thinking on how to approach the Soviet Union
...Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison for contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason, they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact between [the] Western world and their own, feared what would happen if Russians learned [the] truth about [the] world without or if foreigners learned [the] truth about [the] world within. And they have learned to seek security only in patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of rival power, never in compacts and compromises with it.
Soviet power, unlike that of Hitlerite Germany, is neither schematic nor adventuristic. It does not work by fixed plans. It does not take unnecessary risks. Impervious to logic of reason, and it is highly sensitive to logic of force. For this reason, it can easily withdraw—and usually does—when strong resistance is encountered at any point. Thus, if the adversary has sufficient force and makes clear his readiness to use it, he rarely has to do so. If situations are properly handled, there need be no prestige-engaging showdowns. Gauged against [the] Western world as a whole, Soviets are still by far the weaker force. Thus, their success will really depend on degree of cohesion, firmness, and vigor which [the] Western world can muster. And this is [a] factor which it is within our power to influence.
(George Kennan, "The Long Telegram," 1946)
Now think about the contrasting points of view that were expressed in the two excerpts you've read. Use the annotations you've made in each excerpt to help you complete the table.
TIP: Remember, as you fill out each column, you're writing from the perspective of a hardliner or a diplomacy advocate, NOT as yourself. Write the answers you believe they would write them.
