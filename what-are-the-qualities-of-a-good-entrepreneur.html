                            3. what are the qualities of good entrepreneur?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>there certain qualities that all successful entrepreneurs share?</p><p></p><p>After years of personal experience and coaching, I’ve discovered that entrepreneurs share very similar qualities that make them successful. Fortunately, all of these qualities can be learned. It is up to you to carefully examine your strengths and dedicate yourself to learning them.</p><p></p><p>How do these traits match up to your own?</p><p></p><p>1. Self-Discipline</p><p>The first trait that all successful entrepreneurs must possess is self-discipline. Self-discipline is the single most important quality for success in life and business. If you can discipline yourself to do what you should do, whether you feel like it or not, your success is virtually guaranteed. Self-discipline requires self-mastery, self-control, self-responsibility, and self-direction.</p><p></p><p>The difference between successful entrepreneurs and failures is that successful entrepreneurs make a habit of doing the things that failures don’t like to do.</p><p></p><p>What are those things?</p><p></p><p></p><p>The things that failures don’t like to do are the same things that successful people don’t like to do. But, successful entrepreneurs do them anyways because they realize that this is the price they must pay for the success they desire.</p><p></p><p>2. Integrity</p><p>The second trait that all successful entrepreneurs must possess is integrity.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the most valued and respected quality you can develop is a reputation for absolute integrity. Be perfectly honest in everything you do and in every transaction and activity. Never compromise your integrity. Remember that your word is your bond and your honor is everything when it comes to your business. All successful business is based on trust.</p><p></p><p>Your success in becoming an entrepreneur will be determined solely by the number of people who trust you, are willing to work for you, give you credit, lend you money, buy your products and services, and help you during difficult times. Your character is the most important asset that you develop in your entire life, and your character is based on the amount of integrity you practice.</p><p></p><p>3. Persistence</p><p>The third trait that all successful entrepreneurs must possess is persistence. Persistence is the iron quality of character. Persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to steel. It is an indispensable quality that goes hand in hand with all great success in life.</p><p></p><p>Here is one of the great secrets to persistence and success: Program your subconscious mind for persistence well in advance of the setbacks and disappointments that you are going to have on your upward quest toward success.</p><p></p><p>Resolve in advance that you will never give up, no matter what happens.  The courage to persist in the face of adversity and disappointment is the one quality that, more than anything, will guarantee your success.</p><p></p><p>Your greatest asset can be your willingness to persevere longer than anyone else. In fact, your persistence is a true measure of your belief in yourself and your ability to success.</p><p></p><p>4. A Clear Sense Of Direction</p><p>The fourth trait that all successful entrepreneurs must possess is a clear sense of direction.</p><p></p><p>Because of the turbulence and rapid change in today’s marketplace, most business owners have been reduced to operating day-by-day, almost like firefighters.</p><p></p><p>They are totally preoccupied with short-term problems and the need to get short-term sales and profits. They intend to spend more time thinking and planning for the future, but they don’t ever seem to get around to it.</p><p></p><p>This is not for successful business owners. You need to set clear targets for yourself and for every part of your business. In fact, perhaps your most important responsibility to your people is to give them a clear sense of direction in their work.</p><p></p><p>5. Decisive And Action Oriented</p><p>The final trait that all successful entrepreneurs must possess is being decisive and action-oriented. They must think and make decisions quickly. They discipline themselves to take action and to carry out the decisions they have made. They move fast and they get quick feedback from their actions. If they find they have made a mistake, they quickly self-correct and try something else.</p><p></p><p>The key to triumph is for you to try.</p><p></p><p>Successful people are decisive and they try far more things than other people do.</p><p></p><p>If you try far more different ways to be successful, the odds are that you will eventually find the right way for you, at the right time.</p><p></p><p>Those are my traits that all entrepreneurs must have to succeed. Now I have a question for you:</p><p></p><p>What traits do you feel every entrepreneur MUST have to be successful?</p><p></p><p>If you want to learn more about the path to wealth, download my free report, the Way to Wealth here.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Brian Tracy is Chairman and CEO of Brian Tracy International, a company specializing in the training and development of individuals and organizations.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The process of traditional selling typically involves the following steps:</p><p>- Prospecting or finding potential customers</p><p>- Making initial contact and building rapport with the customer</p><p>- Identifying the customer's needs and preferences</p><p>- Presenting the product or service as a solution to the customer's needs</p><p>- Addressing any objections or concerns the customer may have</p><p>- Closing the sale and finalizing the transaction</p><p>- Following up with the customer to ensure satisfaction and encourage repeat business.</p><p></p><p>2. Whether traditional selling or modern selling is more effective depends on various factors, such as the nature of the product or service being sold, the target market, and the salesperson's skills and experience. Traditional selling may be more effective in certain industries or markets where face-to-face interactions and personal relationships are highly valued. On the other hand, modern selling approaches, such as online marketing and social media advertising, may be more effective in reaching a broader audience and generating leads.</p><p></p><p>3. Some qualities of a successful entrepreneur may include:</p><p>- Creativity and innovation: the ability to come up with new and unique ideas and solutions</p><p>- Risk-taking: the willingness to take calculated risks and embrace uncertainty</p><p>- Resilience and perseverance: the ability to bounce back from setbacks and keep going despite challenges</p><p>- Leadership: the ability to inspire and motivate others, and to make tough decisions when needed</p><p>- Passion and drive: a strong sense of purpose and a burning desire to succeed</p><p>- Adaptability: the ability to adjust to changing circumstances and pivot as needed to stay competitive.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. The traditional selling process involves a salesperson approaching a potential customer, either in person or through a communication channel like telephone or email, and attempting to convince them to buy a product or service. The salesperson typically goes through a series of steps, such as introducing themselves, asking the customer questions to understand their needs, presenting the product or service, addressing any objections or concerns the customer may have, and finally, closing the sale by asking for the customer's commitment to make the purchase.</p><p></p><p>2. Whether traditional selling or modern selling is more effective depends on a variety of factors, including the industry, the product or service being sold, the target market, and the salesperson's skills and personality. Traditional selling may be more effective in certain situations, such as when selling high-ticket items that require a personal touch or when dealing with customers who prefer face-to-face interactions. Modern selling, on the other hand, may be more effective in other situations, such as when selling to a tech-savvy audience that prefers to shop online.</p><p></p><p>3. The qualities of an entrepreneur can vary depending on the individual and their business, but some common traits include:</p><p></p><p>- Visionary: Entrepreneurs often have a clear vision of what they want to achieve and the steps they need to take to get there.</p><p></p><p>- Risk-taker: Starting a business involves taking risks, and entrepreneurs must be comfortable with uncertainty and willing to take calculated risks.</p><p></p><p>- Perseverance: Starting and running a business can be challenging, and entrepreneurs must be able to persevere through setbacks and obstacles.</p><p></p><p>- Creativity: Entrepreneurs need to be creative and innovative in order to differentiate their products or services from those of their competitors.</p><p></p><p>- Leadership: Successful entrepreneurs are often effective leaders who can motivate and inspire their team to achieve their goals.</p><p></p><p>- Adaptability: Entrepreneurs must be able to adapt to changing circumstances, such as shifts in the market or unexpected challenges.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Tips for how to become successful</p><p>Here is a list of 10 tips to help you become successful in your life:</p><p></p><p>1. Be committed</p><p>Through commitment, you can gain motivation to pursue success. You should make a list that includes your goal, your level of commitment to the goal and what you are willing to do to achieve that goal. Staying focused on your plan is crucial. It helps to put aside at least 15 minutes per day to think about your plan and work toward it. This will keep your goal fresh in your mind and allow you to continue focusing on it.</p><p></p><p>In determining your commitment to your goal, however, it's important to ensure you have realistic expectations of yourself and the outcome. If your commitment is not paying off after a certain period of time, you should adjust your goal accordingly and revise any necessary steps.</p><p></p><p>At times it may be helpful to ask a friend or family member for support in helping you stick to your commitments. Having someone to hold you accountable for shortcomings and praise your success can really help you stay committed to your goal.</p><p></p><p>2. Learn from the journey</p><p>Rather than focusing strictly on the results of your accomplishments, take notice of the small steps needed to achieve success. If you allow yourself to enjoy small victories along your journey, reaching your goal will become a new adventure each day and you will be more likely to stay on track. By doing this, you will learn new and exciting things along the way, which can help you grow as a person.</p><p></p><p>3. Have fun along the way</p><p>If the journey to achieve something becomes too tedious, it will be more challenging to succeed. Learning what you are capable of can be fun and exciting, so it is important to keep your goals light and fun in order to have an emotionally-positive experience and keep moving forward without losing perspective.</p><p></p><p>4. Think positively</p><p>Developing a positive mindset is all about trusting yourself and your ability to succeed. It is important to replace any negative thoughts with positive ones in order to motivate yourself to keep trying no matter what challenges come your way.</p><p></p><p>Think about when babies are learning to walk. They do not stop when they fall. They get back up and keep going until, one day, they are able to move—and soon run—with ease. In your path to become successful, you are likely learning new things and thinking differently than before. Your goals will not happen overnight. They will take practice and discipline to achieve, so it is vital to think about the process positively.</p><p></p><p></p><p>5. Change your perspective</p><p>Sometimes along the journey, you have to change your perspective to turn a challenging situation into a better one. When you are having a bad day or week, imagine instead that it is a good day or week. Give yourself the opportunity and the time to think about your situation using only positive language and see how much your day or week changes. Doing this for an extended period of time could change your entire life.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
