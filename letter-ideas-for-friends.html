                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>My own idea of a hero is that someone who willingly sacrifice themselves for the safety of people. An individual can be a hero by helping others even if they will struggle as well, and also providing their needs even though they don't have much. My hero can be anyone. But I consider my parents as a Hero of my life.José Rizal is regarded as one of the Philippines' most illustrious individuals. He was a versatile intellectual and political activist most remembered for his political writings, which sparked the Philippine revolution and eventually led to his execution by Spanish invaders. Rizal was also a physician who studied ophthalmology with Louis de Wecker and Otto Becker, two well-known European ophthalmologists. Jose Rizal became a national hero in the Philippines because he battled for freedom in a quiet but effective manner. He was the most multi-talented individual who has ever lived. Rizal battled by writing, which enlightened a large number of Filipinos. Nobility and Dignity are two words that come to mind while thinking about nobility and Rizal's approaches were what set him different from the rest.<br />
