Across  the  past  twenty  years  the  use of  ICT  has  fundamentally  transformed  the practices  and  procedures  of  nearly  all  forms of exertion within business and governance. Education is a very socially focused activity and quality education has traditionally been connected with strong teachers having high degrees of personal contact with learners. The use of ICT in education lends itself to more student-centred learning settings.  But  with  the  world moving  swiftly  into  digital  media  and  information,  the  role  of  ICT  in  education  is  becoming more  and  more  essential  and  this  importance  will  continue  to  grow  and  develop  in  the  21st century.</p><p></p><p>Introduction Digital Era is also known as ‘Information Age’, or ‘New Media Age’.

It also opines that Teaching is a profession and teacher education is a process of professional preparation of teachers. Teachers are concerned, in an important way, with the total development of human beings - physical, intellectual, emotional, social, moral and spiritual. While the dimensions of teaching other than the informational and cognitive may have suffered neglect in modern times due to a variety of factors, one cannot deny that they constitute an integral part of the teachers’ role and functions.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The poem "Mi Ultimo Adios" by Jose Rizal is a farewell poem, a poignant expression of his love for his country, the Philippines. The poem was written in Spanish, which was the language used by the educated class during Rizal's time. </p><p></p><p>The poem is about Rizal's impending death and his last farewell to his beloved country. He expresses his love for the Philippines, its people, and its culture. The poem is also a call to his fellow Filipinos to continue fighting for their freedom and to never give up in the face of oppression.</p><p></p><p>The message of the poem is clear: love for one's country should be unwavering, even in the face of death. Rizal's message to his fellow Filipinos is to continue fighting for their freedom and to never give up. He encourages them to remember their history, their culture, and their identity, and to use these as sources of strength and inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Rizal wrote the poem while he was imprisoned in Fort Santiago, awaiting his execution. He was convicted of rebellion and sedition by the Spanish authorities, who saw him as a threat to their colonial rule. Rizal was a patriot, a writer, and a revolutionary who fought for the freedom of his countrymen. He wrote "Mi Ultimo Adios" as a way of saying goodbye to his beloved country and to inspire his fellow Filipinos to continue the struggle for freedom.</p><p></p><p>The poem is influenced by culture, history, and environment. Rizal was a product of his time, a time when the Philippines was under colonial rule. He was deeply influenced by the history and culture of his country, as well as by the events of his time. Rizal was also influenced by the environment in which he lived, which was one of oppression and injustice. His experiences as a Filipino living under colonial rule inspired him to fight for the freedom of his people.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "Mi Ultimo Adios" is a powerful and moving poem that expresses Rizal's love for his country and his people. It is a call to arms for Filipinos to continue fighting for their freedom and to never give up in the face of oppression. The poem is an inspiration to all who seek freedom and justice, and a reminder of the sacrifices that have been made in the name of freedom.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Each year, more than 100 million animals—including mice, rats, frogs, dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, monkeys, fish, and birds—are killed in U.S. laboratories for biology lessons, medical training, curiosity-driven experimentation, and chemical, drug, food, and cosmetics testing. Before their deaths, some are forced to inhale toxic fumes, others are immobilized in restraint devices for hours, some have holes drilled into their skulls, and others have their skin burned off or their spinal cords crushed. In addition to the torment of the actual experiments, animals in laboratories are deprived of everything that is natural and important to them—they are confined to barren cages, socially isolated, and psychologically traumatized. The thinking, feeling animals who are used in experiments are treated like nothing more than disposable laboratory equipment.</strong></p><p><strong>Hope it helps!</strong></p><p><strong>Brainliest me for more!</strong></p><p></p><br />

The first way is through the balance of species in the ecosystem. Each species plays a unique role in maintaining the balance of the environment, and the loss of a species can have a chain reaction that alters the entire system.</p><p></p><p>The second way the ecosystem affects the environment is through the cycling of materials and energy. In a healthy ecosystem, materials and energy are cyclically moved from one organism to another, but if the ecosystem is disrupted, this cycle can be disrupted, leading to changes in the availability of materials and energy and potential environmental harm.</p><p></p><p>The ecosystem plays a role in maintaining soil and water quality. Healthy ecosystems help to maintain soil fertility and water quality through the actions of soil-building organisms, such as earthworms and bacteria, and by filtering pollutants from water. However, human activities such as deforestation and overgrazing that damage ecosystems can result in soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and water pollution.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the ecosystem has a significant impact on the environment, and it is important to understand and protect the relationships between living organisms and the environment to maintain a healthy and sustainable ecosystem and preserve the environment for future generations.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>           Literature's contribution to cooperation and environmental responsibility shouldn't be underestimated.</p><p>A single reason alone as to why it's essential to the topic will suffice. The three points mainly consist of 1, The power of information-consumption about a worldwide issue. It will give people more clarity to how we as a population can help maintain and improve our environment through ways so simple! 2, The surprising amount of unconcerned and unconscious people towards their enivronmentally harmful actions without realizing it! By providing them helpful information, they can reformulate their actions to be more cooperative and responsible when it comes to the environment.

People across the world can contribute and cooperate with each other to do our responsibility towards our environment. Therefore, based on the given examples, Literature can reach broad horizons to contribute its share of responsibility towards our environment.</p><br />
