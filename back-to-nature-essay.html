 Africa My Africa
 by Davip Diop
Africa my Africa
Africa of proud warriors in ancestral Savannahs
Africa of whom my grandmother sings
On the banks of the distant river
I have never known you
But your blood flows in my veins
Your beautiful black blood that irrigates the fields
The blood of your sweat
The sweat of your work
The work of your slaveryAfrica, tell me Africa
Is this your back that is unbent.
This back that never breaks under the weight of
humiliation
This back trembling with red scars
And saying no to the whip under the midday
sun?
But a grave voice answers me
Impetuous child that tree, young and strong
That tree over there
Splendidly alone amidst white and faded flowers
That is your Africa springing up anew
springing up patiently, obstinately
Whose fruit bit by bit acquires
The bitter taste of liberty.

It is a given fact that Philippines undergo several typhoons every year but it seems that we are not learning from it. Looking back, when you compare the casualties of catastrophic typhoons that hit the Philippines the trends seem to show that we are not really prepared to face these disasters. For instance, on 23 September 2009, Ondoy affected almost 993,227 families, making it to become one of the worst natural disasters in the Philippines in terms of number of people affected. Out of this attected people, 464 were killed and 520 were injured and a total of 15,798 families were temporarily displaced and took refuge in evacuation centers (Olan, 2014). On the same note, on the 15th day of 2011, Sendong hit the northern part of Mindanao and killed almost 1,439 people. The estimated cost of damages by Typhoon Sendong amounted to P999, 946,415 or close to 1 billion and left 65,067 families homeless (Rappler, 2011). Lastly, Typhoon Haiyan, dubbed as the strongest typhoon to land in the recorded history, affected almost 16 million people, leaving in its wake 6,300 deaths, 4.1 million displaced people and 1.1 million houses damaged (USAID, 2014). When you make sense of these numbers, one can readily grasp that we are not resilient in the face of disasters, we are ill-prepared.

 Africa My Africa
 by Davip Diop
Africa my Africa
Africa of proud warriors in ancestral Savannahs
Africa of whom my grandmother sings
On the banks of the distant river
I have never known you
But your blood flows in my veins
Your beautiful black blood that irrigates the fields
The blood of your sweat
The sweat of your work
The work of your slaveryAfrica, tell me Africa
Is this your back that is unbent.
This back that never breaks under the weight of
humiliation
This back trembling with red scars
And saying no to the whip under the midday
sun?
But a grave voice answers me
Impetuous child that tree, young and strong
That tree over there
Splendidly alone amidst white and faded flowers
That is your Africa springing up anew
springing up patiently, obstinately
Whose fruit bit by bit acquires
The bitter taste of liberty.

Use a separate sheet of paper for your answer. Direction: Read and understand carefulh the text below and answer the graphic organizer that follows. It is a given fact that Philippines undergo several typhoons every year but it seems that we are not learning from it. Looking back, when you compare the casualties of catastrophic typhoons that hit the Philippines the trends seem to show that we are not really prepared to face these disasters. For instance, on 23 September 2009, Ondoy affected almost 993,227 families, making it to become one of the worst natural disasters in the Philippines in terms of number of people affected. Out of this attected people, 464 were killed and 520 were injured and a total of 15,798 families were temporarily displaced and took refuge in evacuation centers (Olan, 2014). On the same note, on the 15th day of 2011, Sendong hit the northern part of Mindanao and killed almost 1,439 people. The estimated cost of damages by Typhoon Sendong amounted to P999, 946,415 or close to 1 billion and left 65,067 families homeless (Rappler, 2011). Lastly, Typhoon Haiyan, dubbed as the strongest typhoon to land in the recorded history, affected almost 16 million people, leaving in its wake 6,300 deaths, 4.1 million displaced people and 1.1 million houses damaged (USAID, 2014). When you make sense of these numbers, one can readily grasp that we are not resilient in the face of disasters, we are ill-prepared.

                        <strong>Reaction Paper on Terra X: Wonderful World of Chemistry, The Building Blocks of Nature</strong><strong>Introduction</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>A fantastic magic show is chemistry. Dr. Mai-Thi Nguyen-Kim is passionate about it. She leads the Terra X viewers on an exploration of the development of science. Everything seems a little unusual, but in the end, it's not that much stranger than all the <strong>different kinds of chemistry that have been forming our world ever since the Big Bang.</strong></p><p></p><strong>Body</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>Since the dawn of time,<strong> people have been curious in the composition of the universe. </strong>The early alchemists were encouraged to practice such a transformative skill since solids could turn into liquids and liquids into gases. The philosopher's stone which could turn base metals into gold, was the main goal of their hunt. Even if all of the attempts were unsuccessful, many ineffective strategies produced crucial insights. </p><p></p><p><strong>Utilizing nature's building blocks to produce wholly new substances is another aspect of chemistry.</strong> It allows for the combination of elements and molecules that, in the absence of clever laboratory technology, would never have been possible. It was one of the pioneers of contemporary applied chemistry. </p><p></p><p><strong>He experimented with fertilizers for farming and created extracts for baby food and seasonings. </strong>And he was one of the pioneers in the effort to make chemistry approachable for a broad audience. His show lectures have become a legend. Students and famous people from their era couldn't stop wondering at how powerfully it thumped, buffered, and smoked.</p><p></p><strong>Conclusion</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>Therefore, a living lab is the human body. <strong>Because chemical reactions are constantly happening inside of us. </strong>The building blocks of life can be found throughout the cosmos. Stardust is the source of everything on earth. The sequence of events allowed life to emerge from chemical building blocks here of all places. </p><p></p><p>We may also be able to determine just how amazing it is that we breathe and live on this planet. If we eventually understand what precisely it takes for life to emerge from lifeless chemical building blocks. Consequently,<strong> we can presume that there is more living out there. </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Chemistry and Its types:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2508748</p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><br />
