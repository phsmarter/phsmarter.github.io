Rebuttal Conclusion A convincing restatement of the original claim.Direction: Underline each part of the following argumentation using the colors listed above. Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loyal to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growl at people they think are a threat. They also help boost people's moods because they are friendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. According to them, dogs reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​</a>

Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</a>

                                            For items 6-10, read the passage below to answer the following items. It is odd, but in our family, love always began with a fall of some form or another. This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

A strong argumentation has six key parts. Claim A statement of opinion. This is the thesis of your argumentation. A claim requires arguments. An idea that supports the claim. An argument needs supporting evidences. Argument Evidence Proof or facts that support your each of your arguments. Counter- Argument An argument that your reader would make if they disagreed with your claim. Rebuttal Your response to the counter argument. Conclusion A convincing restatement of the original claim. Direction: Underline each part of the following argumentation using the colors listed above. Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loyal to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growl at people they think are a threat. They also help boost people's moods because they are friendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. According to them, dogs  reduce the risk of cardiovascular case and they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​pasagot po please</a>

                            13. 1. Read the provided essay.
2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>As we face the uncertainties brought about by Covid-19, the importance of learning through the English language is essential in adapting to the needs of the future generations. The pandemic hastened the acceptance of a more digitally inclined educational system and workplace. With technology comes the use of the English language hand in hand with the native language of the Filipinos</strong></p><p><strong>The pandemic pushed our government to implement extreme measures such as the enhanced community quarantine and its variations. Together with this, there were enforced limited mobility of people (especially the senior citizens, minors, and those with comorbidities), following of social or physical distancing, the wearing of facemasks and face shields, limited face-to-face interaction, and the promotion of personal health and disinfection.</strong></p><p><strong>The most crucial impact of the pandemic is seen through the rising unemployment due to the restrictions in the livelihood of people. Those persons who live through day-to-day jobs such as the jeepney drivers, tricycle drivers, food stall owners or vendors, and contractual employees are the mostly affected. Filipinos are resilient, and with it, former employees learn to create new jobs out of their talents</strong></p><p><strong>Jobs for online English teachers were an option for them. Likewise, opening of an online marketing business through social media became a hit for those who stayed home with internet access and a product to sell. A former barista in a restaurant who was laid off due to the lockdown, created a coffee vending business together with his former co-workers.</strong></p><p><strong>The Filipinos learned to adapt to changes brought about by uncertainties with the use of technology and the support of the family. In learning to cope with the challenges ahead, the academic community also opened its doors to globalizing education through the E-learning modalities, both synchronous and asynchronous.  Schools such as the St. Vincent de Ferrer College of Camarin strengthens its grip in digital education using technology and the English language in this time of crisis.</strong></p><p><strong>The families of Vincentian students are encouraged to learn and engage with the English language as we share our experiences of resilience in times of uncertainties. Students are enjoined to share their experiences by sending them to the email address of the year/grade English subject coordinators.</strong></p><p><strong>Learning the English language will open doors for the family by creating access to technology, information, and financial resources. It will also bring more educational and employment opportunities in the future.</strong></p><p><strong>Now is the time to “live, love and learn through the English language” as part of the Vincentian family in this time of pandemic.</strong></p><p><strong>pwede naba to?? ikaw na bahala mag edit sa ibang words </strong></p><p><strong>pa brainliest</strong></p><p></p><br />

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</h2><br />

                            22. For items 6-10, read the passage below to answer the following items. It is odd, but in our family, love always began with a fall of some form or another. This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                            23. Activity 6: Argument Writing: Parts of an Argumentative Essay When you write an argumentative essay, you are trying to convince your reader that your opinion is correct. A strong argumentation has six key parts. Claim A statement of opinion. This is the thesis of your argumentation. A claim requires arguments. An idea that supports the claim. An argument needs supporting evidences. Argument Evidence Proof or facts that support your each of your arguments. Counter- Argument An argument that your reader would make if they disagreed with your claim. Rebuttal Your response to the counter argument. Conclusion A convincing restatement of the original claim. Direction: Underline each part of the following argumentation using the colors listed above. Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loyal to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growl at people they think are a threat. They also help boost people's moods because they are friendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. According to them, dogs  reduce the risk of cardiovascular case and they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​pasagot po please</h2><br />
