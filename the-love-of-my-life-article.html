Encircle the letter of the correct answer if there are choices.Why does a cow chewing when she isn’t eating?		A cow has a special stomach with four parts.  When she eats grass, she chews it just enough to make it wet.  Then it goes into the first part of her stomach, where it becomes softer.  From there it goes into the second part, where it is made into little balls called “cuds”.  Later, while the cow is resting, she brings up each cud one at a time and chews it well.  When she swallows it, the food goes into the third part of her stomach.  There the water is squeezed out of it.  Finally, the food goes to the fourth part of the cow’s stomach and is broken down into very tiny pieces.  Then the cow’s body can take what it needs from the food to live and grow.1.

                                            Learning Task 2 Read the article below and outline the key concepts that are presented therein. Write your answers in your notebook Modern Generation Youth Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modem generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc Today's youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" is the opinion of majority of the elderly people They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcoho smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general They feel that there should be a certain kind of decencyin their code of dressing be it at home, college workplace or the church temple mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent cause they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society By this 1 mean it is the youth who can implement the aws and make the required changes To bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands.1.

                                            God chose a people to be His own people to manifest His loving plan of salvation for all humanity. God saved them from slavery and formed  them into one people by making a covenant with them through Moses. God spoke to them through Moses saying, “You yourselves have  seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant,  then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and  a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.” 
God fulfilled His promise to give them a land. When they had settled in the land of Israel and needed rulers to lead them, God chose  people to be their leaders. When they asked for a king, God granted their request. At the beginning of their life as a kingdom, they had  Saul, David, and Solomon. But the kings were not always faithful to God. David sinned yet he repented. God forgave him and did not  revoke the covenant He made with him.

 Count Your Blessings
 Unknown
What are some of the blessings we receive from because of our faith in Jesus Christ?
One of the greatest blessings is answers to our prayers.
When Jim was a little boy, he loved to ride his horse. He had a pair of spurs that made him feel like a cowboy. One day when he came in from riding, he was disobedient and his mother sent him to his room in the basement. He was so angry that he threw his spurs down the stairs. Later he repented and told his mother that he was sorry. The next time he wanted to ride his horse, he couldn’t find the spurs. He looked everywhere. Finally he knelt and prayed to Heavenly Father to help him find them. When he finished praying he started looking again and found them.
This was the beginning of Jim’s testimony that Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. Now he is a stake president. He teaches the children in his stake that praying every night and morning will bring them great blessings all the rest of their lives.
Praying sincerely to Heavenly Father morning and night makes it easier to hear the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter and Jesus Christ promised to all who keep His commandments. The Holy Ghost can teach us, guide us and help us feel peace in our hearts. These blessings come when we have faith in Jesus Christ.
Sometimes we need strength because life is hard for us. Christy wanted to memorize the articles of faith and earn her Gospel in Action award. It was extra hard for her because she has cerebral palsy. Christy had faith that the Lord would help her. She listened to the song tapes of the Articles of Faith over and over. She practiced until she could sing them all and earned her award. Her family and friends were blessed by her good example. When we count our blessings we can say, “My prayers are answered, I receive guidance and comfort, I can receive strength to overcome trials.” Yes, faith in Jesus Christ blesses our lives.</a>

                        Answer<p>The caption is about how the two couples, Justine and Chikki, inspire one another in their unique ways. Chikki is good at cheering while Justine is good at encouraging. They perfectly cover each other's weaknesses. By how they love each other, we can understand the weaknesses of the two. For example, Justine tends to be a Melancholic, so, he loves Chikki because she always makes him smile. While Chikki is easily daunted/discouraged, thus, she loves Justine for being encouraging and supportive. This explains why the title of the news article is "Born for You."</p><p></p><p><strong>Learning Visual Arts -</strong> https://brainly.ph/question/2809402</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

Encircle the letter of the correct answer if there are choices.Why does a cow chewing when she isn’t eating?		A cow has a special stomach with four parts.  When she eats grass, she chews it just enough to make it wet.  Then it goes into the first part of her stomach, where it becomes softer.  From there it goes into the second part, where it is made into little balls called “cuds”.  Later, while the cow is resting, she brings up each cud one at a time and chews it well.  When she swallows it, the food goes into the third part of her stomach.  There the water is squeezed out of it.  Finally, the food goes to the fourth part of the cow’s stomach and is broken down into very tiny pieces.  Then the cow’s body can take what it needs from the food to live and grow.1.

                            6. Learning Task 2 Read the article below and outline the key concepts that are presented therein. Write your answers in your notebook Modern Generation Youth Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modem generation youth wants to enjoy the gift of freedom He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking, bungee jumping etc Today's youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries. In other words, they want to live energized lives It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" is the opinion of majority of the elderly people They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcoho smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general They feel that there should be a certain kind of decencyin their code of dressing be it at home, college workplace or the church temple mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent cause they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society By this 1 mean it is the youth who can implement the aws and make the required changes To bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands.1.

In other words, they want to live energized lives It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an open interaction with their parents. Thus the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need special counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" is the opinion of majority of the elderly people They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcoho smoking, drugs, and an attempt to commit suicide etc. The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns, and people in general They feel that there should be a certain kind of decencyin their code of dressing be it at home, college workplace or the church temple mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off in the context of the youth is the ever increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evi due to lack of love and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for the excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up to suicide. So therefore my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent cause they can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make our society By this 1 mean it is the youth who can implement the aws and make the required changes To bring about a progress in our society. And thus look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with the youth is good or not. It's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands.

                            8. God chose a people to be His own people to manifest His loving plan of salvation for all humanity. God saved them from slavery and formed  them into one people by making a covenant with them through Moses. God spoke to them through Moses saying, “You yourselves have  seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant,  then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and  a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.” 
God fulfilled His promise to give them a land. When they had settled in the land of Israel and needed rulers to lead them, God chose  people to be their leaders. When they asked for a king, God granted their request. At the beginning of their life as a kingdom, they had  Saul, David, and Solomon. But the kings were not always faithful to God. David sinned yet he repented. God forgave him and did not  revoke the covenant He made with him.

 Count Your Blessings
 Unknown
What are some of the blessings we receive from because of our faith in Jesus Christ?
One of the greatest blessings is answers to our prayers.
When Jim was a little boy, he loved to ride his horse. He had a pair of spurs that made him feel like a cowboy. One day when he came in from riding, he was disobedient and his mother sent him to his room in the basement. He was so angry that he threw his spurs down the stairs. Later he repented and told his mother that he was sorry. The next time he wanted to ride his horse, he couldn’t find the spurs. He looked everywhere. Finally he knelt and prayed to Heavenly Father to help him find them. When he finished praying he started looking again and found them.
This was the beginning of Jim’s testimony that Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. Now he is a stake president. He teaches the children in his stake that praying every night and morning will bring them great blessings all the rest of their lives.
Praying sincerely to Heavenly Father morning and night makes it easier to hear the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter and Jesus Christ promised to all who keep His commandments. The Holy Ghost can teach us, guide us and help us feel peace in our hearts. These blessings come when we have faith in Jesus Christ.
Sometimes we need strength because life is hard for us. Christy wanted to memorize the articles of faith and earn her Gospel in Action award. It was extra hard for her because she has cerebral palsy. Christy had faith that the Lord would help her. She listened to the song tapes of the Articles of Faith over and over. She practiced until she could sing them all and earned her award. Her family and friends were blessed by her good example. When we count our blessings we can say, “My prayers are answered, I receive guidance and comfort, I can receive strength to overcome trials.” Yes, faith in Jesus Christ blesses our lives.</h2><br />
