                            2. 'why English is considered as the global language?''</h2><br />
                        Because a lot of people from around the world are already using it to communicate with those from other countries. Especially because it is the language that originated from Europe and it is the major tongue in the Americas also known as The New World.<br />English is considered as the global language because almost people in the world knows how to speak english<br /><br />

                        <p>The rise of English is a remarkable success story. ... English at the end of the 20th Century is more widely spoken and written than any other language ever has been. It has become the language of the planet, the first truly global language.</p><br />

                            4. Pahelp po1. What is English as a lingua franca?2. What are your thoughts on the English language in the world? Do you agree that we should all be able to recognize the various varieties of English, including our own, Philippine English, which has a hard tongue pronunciation?3. Is it preferable to have a single standard English, i.e., a single variety to be used in global communication, or to stick with world Englishes, which accept all varieties of English? Why?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>English as a lingua franca</strong> is the concept of using the English language as a way to communicate globally. This means that even people whose first language is something else will be able to understand and speak the same language, which is English.</p><p>
</p><p>2. Right now, English is considered to be the best way to communicate with people from other countries and cultures across the globe. There are other languages that are more commonly spoken, but the difference is <strong>the number of resources one can use to study the English language</strong>. It makes the most sense to use it as the lingua franca.</p><p>As for the second question, I think that <strong>different English varieties should be recognized</strong>. It should not be considered wrong simply because they do not exactly resemble American English or UK English. Philippine English is different because it has been influenced by our local languages and dialects.</p><p>3. In my opinion, it is better to stay with different world Englishes. For one thing, even the more acknowledged versions of the language like American English or British English is different. It would take a lot of effort to build a standard version. On top of that, the different versions came about due to cultural differences and contribute to a better understanding of the world in general. In the end, important thing is that <strong>language is intelligible and could be used to communicate with other speakers</strong> regardless of the version of English they are using.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Check out this definition of lingua franca: https://brainly.ph/question/3195411</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. English is considered a global language because of its widespread use as a means of communication around the world. English has become a lingua franca or a common language used by people from different linguistic backgrounds to communicate with each other. English is also used as a medium of instruction in many schools, universities, and institutions across the world. It is the official language of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Due to its global reach and influence, English has become an essential language for international business, science, technology, and diplomacy.</p><p></p><p>2. The two most well-known varieties of English are British English (also known as UK English) and American English. British English is spoken in the United Kingdom and its former colonies, including India, South Africa, and Australia. American English is spoken in the United States and Canada, as well as in some parts of the Caribbean.</p><p></p><p>3. The three distinct categories of world Englishes are inner circle, outer circle, and expanding circle. The inner circle includes countries where English is the primary language, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The outer circle includes countries where English is an official language but not the primary language, such as India, Nigeria, and Singapore. The expanding circle includes countries where English is not an official language but is used as a means of communication, such as China, Japan, and South Korea.</p><p></p><p>4. The five major forms of discrimination that can be addressed through the use of culturally-sensitive and bias-free language are gender, race, ethnicity, age, and ability. Gender discrimination can be addressed by using gender-neutral language and avoiding gender stereotypes. Race and ethnicity discrimination can be addressed by avoiding racial slurs and stereotypes and using inclusive language. Age discrimination can be addressed by avoiding ageist language and stereotypes. Ability discrimination can be addressed by using person-first language and avoiding ableist language and stereotypes.</p><br />
