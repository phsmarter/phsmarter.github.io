We have several ways to prevent teenage pregnancy in our health institutions (Clinics, private and public hospitals).

The rate of teenage pregnancy differs in countries depending on whether the country is developed or underdeveloped. Obviously in underdeveloped countries the rate will be high because of poverty.</p><p>Teenage pregnancy is a destruction to education. It sets back lives of teenagers and some of them don’t go back to school after having babies, because they are ashamed. Some see no reason to go back to school which is wrong. Without education these days life is very difficult, because you can’t get a good job without qualifications.</p><br />
