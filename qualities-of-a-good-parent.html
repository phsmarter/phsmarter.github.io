As a consumer, how are you going to assure that the products you are buying are in good quality and will not affect your health.2. The Department of Health is already planning to start giving shots of the COVID-19 vaccines to children ages 12-17 years old, what is your opinion about this?​</h2><br />
                         <strong>Answer:</strong>- 1. In this situation, study the aspects of a consumer wisely choosing the best products: the material, expiration date and labels, if possible question an employer nearby about the said product. Simply, good quality products are made from good quality materials. Make sure to always check for lumps, snags or holes.  2. In my opinion, it is very satisfying to here that children can be vaccinated, however the problem here is that if children has any health problems then the vaccine might affect it. But of course, it is more reassuring that they don't force anyone to be vaccinated with health problems, as long as they're informed. I'm sure enough it'll be helpful for me and my siblings to be vaccinated soon. #CARRYONLEARNING<p></p><br />
