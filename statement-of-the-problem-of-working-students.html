They often have errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 2. An article by the think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) on Monday, April 20, said SHS difficulty in writing in English was particularly evident in research projects. 3. Most students have big problems in using different punctuation marks. The learning and teaching report showed that incorrect punctuation caused the most problems for students in conveying meaning in their essay writing (Department of Student Services, 2013, p. 23). 4. To convey meaning, students must punctuate their work correctly. This is very important in writing. Students should always remember this. 5. I believe that the current curriculum in English is not working well for the Filipino learners. Instead of helping them improve their English skills, they are becoming worse. need help po:(​</a>

This results in distraction.2. One solution that some experts suggests is that students need to study withouttechnology for a set period of time.3. However, this requires a lot of discipline and self-control.4. On the other hand, others suggest that technology like apps can also be usedto improve the concentration of students.5.

They often have errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 2. An article by the think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) on Monday, April 20, said SHS difficulty in writing in English was particularly evident in research projects. 3. Most students have big problems in using different punctuation marks. The learning and teaching report showed that incorrect punctuation caused the most problems for students in conveying meaning in their essay writing (Department of Student Services, 2013, p. 23). 4. To convey meaning, students must punctuate their work correctly. This is very important in writing. Students should always remember this. 5. I believe that the current curriculum in English is not working well for the Filipino learners. Instead of helping them improve their English skills, they are becoming worse. need help po:(​</h2><br />

Listening is an essential skill that is beneficial both in the classroom and in the workplace, as it helps us to more effectively interact with and understand others. Working on listening in the classroom can help to develop active listening skills which can then be used in day-to-day social interactions, such as conversations with friends, family and colleagues. Listening requires attention and focus, so it is important that students are aware of the importance of this practice and are given the opportunity to hone their listening skills both in the classroom and outside of it.</p><br />

This research study aims to find out the effectiveness of asynchronous online andprinted modular learning to the academic performance of working students,12. The respondents of the study are the Grade 10 working students of San FabianNational High School for the school year 2020-2021.13. A 2015 study by Heather Kauffmann explored factors predictive of student successand satisfaction with online learning. 111 Kauffmann notes that several studies havefound that online learning programmes lead to outcomes that are comparable tothose of face-to-face programmes.14. There is a significant difference between the students' performance in the pre-testand the post-test.15. This study used the experimental method of research since aims to find out theacademic performance of the Grade 10 students...A questionnaire and a test weregiven to the respondents... Data gathered from the students will be treated statisticallythrough the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>Abstract
</p><p>The following study contrasts the efficacy of online delivery relative to face-to-
</p><p>face delivery using an enrolment protocol that largely eliminates self-selection 
</p><p>bias. Only a few previous studies even attempt to control for sample selection. 
</p><p>The study utilizes random assignment of the registrants of a Principles of 
</p><p>Macroeconomics class into two alternative venues: online and face-to-face. 
</p><p>The same professor taught both sections with the same course objectives and 
</p><p>exams. Both the change in student scores from the pre-test to the post-test 
</p><p>and the student’s exam average are modelled as a function of the course 
</p><p>environment, the student’s SAT math score (or ACT equivalent), the student’s
</p><p>GPA prior to taking the course, the student’s gender and the student’s overall 
</p><p>credit hours prior to taking the course. The pre- and post-test had both 
</p><p>standardized and instructor-specific questions. Students in the face-to-face 
</p><p>section have statistically significantly higher exam scores and statistically 
</p><p>significantly greater improvement on the post-test instructor questions. There 
</p><p>is no statistical difference in the improvement on the post-test overall nor in 
</p><p>the improvement in the post-test standardized questions. These mixed results 
</p><p>suggest that both course objectives and the mechanism used to assess the 
</p><p>relative effectiveness of the two modes of education may play an important 
</p><p>part in determining the relative effectiveness of alternative delivery methods.</p><p></p><p>sana makatulong ang sagot ko</p><p>hope its help you </p><p>thank you for your question</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>answer 3 </p><p>- There are a number of ways businesses can protect mother earth, even as they innovate and distribute new products. </p><p>One important way is to reduce the carbon footprints of those products. Steps businesses can take to do this include using more environmentally friendly materials in product design, finding more efficient and sustainable ways to produce and package products, and reducing the overall energy consumption of their operations.</p><p>Another way businesses can help protect the planet is by supporting policies that incentivize sustainability. For example, businesses can advocate for measures that would make it easier to adopt environmentally friendly practices or that would penalize companies for their carbon footprints.</p><p>Ultimately, it will take concerted effort from businesses and consumers alike to protect mother earth. But by working together, we can create a more sustainable future for all.</p><p></p><p>Answer 4 </p><p>-As an NSTP student, I would work to empower individuals to take action on climate change. I would also work to create a progressive community that is committed to addressing climate change. I would do this by organizing events, raising awareness, and working with local leaders to develop policies that address climate change.</p><p></p><br />
