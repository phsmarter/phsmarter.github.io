                                            Our Life as Valuable Gift of Allah The most important thing that Allah s.w.t the creator has given us is the gift of life. In the beginning, there was nothing that existed except Allah s.w.t by his will, he created everything, include mankind. The wisdom of our creation was stated in revelations of Allah s.w.t through different books sent to mankind from Adam's time up to the coming of Muhammad s.a.w as last messenger. Allah created us and gave us life; our life is our debt to creator. Being indebted to our creator, it is our obligation to repay him for his mercy on us. That is the reason why the life of a single believer is dearer to Allah s.w.t than the entire universe. With our piety, we are the most valuable creation. With our piety, we are the most valuable creation. With our piety, we are the most valuable creation. With our piety, we are the most valuable creation of our merciful Allah s.w.t if we have no faith; our life is worth nothing in his sight. IV.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Gravity pulls the book down, but it doesn't fall down.</p><p>2.The book did not continue to slide. Friction is responsible for making the sliding book slow down and eventually stop.</p><p>3.Since stone and pencil are falling in a vacuum, there will be no air resistance on them. Hence, time taken for them to reach the ground will be same.</p><p>4.Friction is what holds your shoe to the ground. The friction present on the ice is very little, this is the reason why it is hard to walk on the slippery surface of the ice. Writing – A frictional force is created when the tip of the pen comes in contact with the surface of the paper.</p><p>5.Gravity is very important to us. We could not live on Earth without it. The sun's gravity keeps Earth in orbit around it, keeping us at a comfortable distance to enjoy the sun's light and warmth.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>For example, when a book is placed on a table, the normal force keeps the book from falling through the table. Gravity is pulling the book downward, but since the book isn't actually falling, something must be pushing it up. This force is called the normal force</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>the sliding of the book cannot continue because the friction will slow down the sliding book to stop completely</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Stone </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Friction can slow things down and stop stationary things from moving. In a frictionless world, more objects would be sliding about, clothes and shoes would be difficult to keep on and it would be very difficult for people or cars to get moving or change direction</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Gravity is very important to us.

                            12. Our Life as Valuable Gift of Allah The most important thing that Allah s.w.t the creator has given us is the gift of life. In the beginning, there was nothing that existed except Allah s.w.t by his will, he created everything, include mankind. The wisdom of our creation was stated in revelations of Allah s.w.t through different books sent to mankind from Adam's time up to the coming of Muhammad s.a.w as last messenger. Allah created us and gave us life; our life is our debt to creator. Being indebted to our creator, it is our obligation to repay him for his mercy on us. That is the reason why the life of a single believer is dearer to Allah s.w.t than the entire universe. With our piety, we are the most valuable creation. With our piety, we are the most valuable creation. With our piety, we are the most valuable creation. With our piety, we are the most valuable creation of our merciful Allah s.w.t if we have no faith; our life is worth nothing in his sight. IV.

1. Place a book on top of a table. What keeps the book from falling?
How is this possible?
2. Roll a marble on top of a level surface. Make it stop. Slide a light book
on top of the same level surface by giving it an initial push. Did the
book continue to slide? What is responsible for making the sliding
book slow down and eventually stop?
3. Drop a small stone and a piece of paper from the same height at the
same time. Observe closely the motion of the stone and the paper
as they fall. Which of them reached the ground first? Why did not the
other one reach the ground at the same time as the first?
4. What is the importance of friction in our daily life?
5. Why do we need gravity?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The table stops the book from falling.</p><p>2. Because of the book and the force change, the marble going down is now going up and because of the gravity it slows down.</p><p>3. the rock hit the ground first because the rock has more mass the the paper and more mass attract gravity more.</p><p>4. It is really important like if where going to make a fire we need a lightstick and we create a friction to make it.</p><p>5. we really need gravity because it's hard to move on a zero gravity like in space if you jump you go forever because no one stops you.</p><br />

                        <p>The book of Matthew is one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is believed to have been written by Matthew, a disciple of Jesus, and is primarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The book contains the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of the Kingdom" due to its emphasis on the coming of the Kingdom of God.</p><p></p><p>The book of Mark is also one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Mark, a disciple of Peter, and is primarily focused on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. The book contains Jesus' baptism, temptation, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Action" due to its emphasis on Jesus' deeds rather than his words.</p><p></p><p>The book of John is another one of the four Gospel books in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by John, a disciple of Jesus, and is primarily focused on the divinity of Jesus Christ. The book contains Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Belief" due to its emphasis on the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God.</p><p></p><p>The book of Luke is the third Gospel book in the New Testament. It is believed to have been written by Luke, a physician and companion of Paul, and is primarily focused on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The book contains the birth, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and is often referred to as the "Gospel of Mercy" due to its emphasis on Jesus' compassion and concern for the poor and marginalized.</p><p></p><p>One of the most well-known Bible verses about the Gospel is John 3:16, which states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse highlights the central message of the Gospel, which is that through faith in Jesus Christ, we can be saved and have eternal life.</p><p></p><p>The Gospel is of utmost importance in the life of Christians because it contains the message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. It provides guidance, comfort, and hope to believers, and helps them to live a life in accordance with God's will.</p><p></p><p>At this moment in my life, the most significant Bible verse that I would use to communicate is Philippians 4:6-7, which states, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." This verse reminds us to trust in God and to bring our worries and concerns to Him in prayer.</p><p></p><p>To help my family read the Bible well, I can encourage them to set aside a specific time each day for Bible reading and prayer, and to choose a Bible study plan or devotional to follow. I can also discuss and reflect on the passages with them to deepen our understanding and share our insights.</p><p></p><p>In this pandemic time, I can apply the teachings of the Gospel by showing compassion and kindness to those who are affected by the virus, and by trusting in God's plan and His protection.</p><p></p><p>Dear God, we pray for your protection and good health during this pandemic time. May you guard our hearts and minds and keep us safe</p><br />

                            30. Learning Task 6: Study the following situations and answer the question for each. Remember what you have learned about gravity and friction. Write your explanations on your answer sheet.
1. Place a book on top of a table. What keeps the book from falling? How is this possible?
2. Roll a marble on top of a level surface. Make it stop. Slide a light book on top of the same level surface by giving it an initial push. Did the book continue to slide? What is responsible for making the sliding book slow down and eventually stop?
3. Drop a small stone and a piece of paper from the same height at the same time. Observe closely the motion of the stone and the paper as they fall. Which of them reached the ground first? Why did not the other one reach the ground at the same time as the first?
4. What is the importance of friction in our daily life?
5. Why do we need gravity?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Gravity is the force that makes the book </strong><strong>fall.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2. Friction was the reason why is the book stop </strong><strong>sliding.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3. The stone will land faster that the paper because the stone is heavy while the paper is </strong><strong>light.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4. Without fricition, everything we step looks like stepping on ice (Cuz we will keep slipping). Friction is responsible to slide or to stop the movement of an object.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5. Without gravity, earth will shatter because gravity makes the techtonic plates stick together.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>study</strong><strong> well</strong><strong> </strong><strong>students</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><br />
