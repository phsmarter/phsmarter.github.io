                                            Please help me guys explain this in tagalog 1. The relation between individual and society is very close. Essentially, “society” is the regularities, customs and ground rules of antihuman behavior. These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2. The individual lives and acts within society but society is nothing, in spite of the combination of individuals for cooperative effort. On the other hand, society exists to serve individuals not the other way around. Human life and society almost go together. The relationship between individual and society is ultimately one of the profound of all the problems of social philosophy.3. The ultimate goal of society is to promote good and happy life for its individuals. It creates conditions and opportunities for the all round development of individual personality. ​</a>

"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to discuss a topic that has been debated for centuries – beauty or intelligence. Both are highly sought after qualities in our society, but which one holds more value? Some people believe that beauty is the key to success in life, while others argue that intelligence is far more important. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will examine the pros and cons of each and hopefully come to a better understanding of what truly makes a person successful.
Let's start by exploring the concept of beauty. Beauty is often considered to be a gift from nature, a physical attribute that can be enhanced through makeup and cosmetic procedures. People who possess this gift often enjoy a range of benefits, such as being more attractive to potential partners, having an easier time finding employment, and even earning higher salaries. However, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. Moreover, beauty is fleeting – it fades with time, leaving one to rely on other qualities.
On the other hand, intelligence is a quality that lasts a lifetime. Intelligent people possess the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and learn from their mistakes. These skills are highly valued in the workplace, where the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions can make all the difference. Intelligence is also highly beneficial in our personal lives, as it allows us to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with others.
While both beauty and intelligence have their advantages, it's clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality in the long run. Beauty may open doors, but it's intelligence that keeps them open. A beautiful person may initially attract attention, but it's their intelligence that will earn them respect and admiration. Additionally, intelligence can be developed through education and experience, whereas beauty is largely predetermined.
In conclusion, the debate between beauty and intelligence has raged on for centuries, with no clear winner. However, when we examine the advantages of each, it becomes clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality. Beauty may be alluring, but it's intelligence that truly sets a person apart from the crowd. So let us all strive to cultivate our minds and develop our intelligence, as it is the key to true success and fulfillment in life. Thank you."</a>

Personal development is closely linked to
self-awareness. It gives you the opportunity
to take an honest look at the areas of your
life that need improvement. Through this
process, you get to know who you really
are, what your true values are, and where
you would like to go in life. It is very important in order for us students
not to regret our decisions in life. We
should think thoroughly because we may
never know what will happen in the future.

This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning.

These practices are tremendously important to know how humans act and interact with each other. Society does not exist independently without individual. 2.

                            13. Can anyone translate this speech in tagalog please? 
"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to discuss a topic that has been debated for centuries – beauty or intelligence. Both are highly sought after qualities in our society, but which one holds more value? Some people believe that beauty is the key to success in life, while others argue that intelligence is far more important. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will examine the pros and cons of each and hopefully come to a better understanding of what truly makes a person successful.
Let's start by exploring the concept of beauty. Beauty is often considered to be a gift from nature, a physical attribute that can be enhanced through makeup and cosmetic procedures. People who possess this gift often enjoy a range of benefits, such as being more attractive to potential partners, having an easier time finding employment, and even earning higher salaries. However, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective, and what one person finds attractive, another may not. Moreover, beauty is fleeting – it fades with time, leaving one to rely on other qualities.
On the other hand, intelligence is a quality that lasts a lifetime. Intelligent people possess the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and learn from their mistakes. These skills are highly valued in the workplace, where the ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions can make all the difference. Intelligence is also highly beneficial in our personal lives, as it allows us to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with others.
While both beauty and intelligence have their advantages, it's clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality in the long run. Beauty may open doors, but it's intelligence that keeps them open. A beautiful person may initially attract attention, but it's their intelligence that will earn them respect and admiration. Additionally, intelligence can be developed through education and experience, whereas beauty is largely predetermined.
In conclusion, the debate between beauty and intelligence has raged on for centuries, with no clear winner. However, when we examine the advantages of each, it becomes clear that intelligence is the more valuable quality. Beauty may be alluring, but it's intelligence that truly sets a person apart from the crowd. So let us all strive to cultivate our minds and develop our intelligence, as it is the key to true success and fulfillment in life. Thank you."</h2><br />

This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning.
