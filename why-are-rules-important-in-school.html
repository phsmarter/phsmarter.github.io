Summarize this text type based on elements of persuasive text.STORY:Why Is It Important to Follow School Rules?Every school, every classroom and every teacher has rules for students to follow, no matter the learners' ages. These rules often address responsibilities like being on time. being prepared, being courteous to staff and other students, being respectful of property, doing your best and following any other rules that the school sets forth.While some students may see the rules as unnecessary or simply a way for teachers and administrators to control them. Following school rules can be extremely important for safety. ensuring everyone has an equal chance at learning and preparing kids for the future.                Rules Foster Safety for Everyone. One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school. Learning to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules are important well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules!​</a>

No rules, so you're free. The students will be more hardheaded. </p><br />

An approach to optimum saving is to find the saving rate that maximizes consumption per capita in the steady state. This saving rate is the “golden-rule” saving rate. A lower saving rate would reduce long-run steady-state consumption per capita, but would imply higher consumption in the short run.</p><p></p><p>2.)Inflation is a function of the supply and demand for money, meaning that producing relatively more dollars causes each dollar to become less valuable, forcing the general price level to rise.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana maka tulong po:))</p><br />

                        <p> </p><p></p><p> Schools are the mental concentration camps. Schools train people to accept a society where the government and other institutions tell us what to think and do.</p><p></p><p>Following school rules is extremely important for students in school. When students follow school rules it can lead to staying safe and focused.</p><p></p><p>When students in school stay focused they will most likely get a better education. Staying focused is probably not a written rule in school, but it is definitely a rule that teachers, principals, and parents want students to follow. Rules that students can follow to help stay focused include not talking in class unless told by a teacher or supervisor. When a class is unsupervised students should work on class work and ask a friend or someone who is close for help if needed.</p><p></p><p>School rules are important to maintain discipline. School rules play important role in ensuring that the students know how to behave and the consequences of misbehaving. I strongly feel that school rules are a useful guide to prevent any unwanted punishments and embarrassments.</p><p>Firstly, school rules are to make students aware of what they are not supposed to do, bring or say inside to school or in public. If students are aware of the school rules, they will know how to behave and carry themselves so as not to become a disgrace to their school. I feel that it is necessary to have school rules to maintain discipline and order in the school.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, following school rules is extremely important for students of all ages in order to get a better education. Following rules can help students stay safe and focused all day.</p><p></p><br />
