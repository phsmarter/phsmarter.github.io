                            8. write an essay about what is ask How do steps in scientific method help in solving problems?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Identify the problem. The first step in the scientific method is to identify and analyze a problem. Data regarding the problem can be collected using a variety of methods. One way we’re all accustomed to is the classic: who, what, where, when, how, and to what extent? The scientific method works best when you have a problem that can be measured or quantified in some way.</p><p></p><p>2. Form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a statement that provides an educated prediction or proposed solution. A good format for a hypothesis would be, “If we do XX, then YY will happen.” Remember, the hypothesis should be measurable so it can help you solve the business problem identified in step one.</p><p></p><p>3. Test the hypothesis by conducting an experiment. This is when an activity is created to confirm (or not confirm) the hypothesis. There have been entire books written about conducting experiments. We won’t be going into that kind of depth today but it’s important to keep in mind a few things when conducting your experiment:</p><p></p><p>The experiment must be fair and objective. Otherwise, it will skew the result.</p><p></p><p>It should include a significant number of participants or it will not be statistically representative of the whole.</p><p></p><p>Allow for ample time to collect the information.</p><p></p><p>4. Analyze the data. Once the experiment is complete, the results can be analyzed. The results should either confirm the hypothesis as true or false. If by chance, the results aren’t confirmed, this doesn’t mean the experiment was a failure. In fact, it might give you additional insight to form a new hypothesis. It reminds me of the famous Thomas Edison quote, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”</p><p></p><p>5. Communicate the results. Whatever the result, the outcomes from the experiment should be communicated to the organization. This will help stakeholders understand which challenges have been resolved and which need further investigation. It will create buy-in for future experiments. Stakeholders might also be in a position to help develop a more focused hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>Now let’s use the scientific method in a business example:</p><p></p><p>Step 1 (identification): Human resources has noticed an increase in resignations over the past six months. Operational managers have said that the company isn’t paying employees enough. The company needs to figure out why employees are resigning?</p><p></p><p>Step 2 (hypothesis): If we increase employee pay, then fewer resignations will occur.</p><p></p><p>Step 3 (test): For the next three months, HR will have a third-party conduct exit interviews to determine the reason employees are resigning.</p><p></p><p>Step 4 (analysis): The third-party report shows that the primary reason employees are leaving is because health care premiums have increased and coverage has decreased. Employees have found new jobs with better benefits.</p><p></p><p>Step 5 (communication): After communicating the results, the company is examining their budget to determine if they should:</p><p></p><p>Increase employee pay to cover the health insurance premium expense or</p><p></p><p>Re-evaluate their health care benefits package.</p><p></p><p>I’ve found using the scientific method to be very helpful in situations like the example where a person or small group have a theory about how to solve a problem. But that theory hasn’t completely been bought into by everyone. Offering the option to test the proposed solution, without a full commitment, tells the group that their suggestion is being heard and that the numbers will ultimately provide insight – after the full scientific method has been followed.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Identify the problem. The first step in the scientific method is to identify and analyze a problem. Data regarding the problem can be collected using a variety of methods. One way we’re all accustomed to is the classic: who, what, where, when, how, and to what extent? The scientific method works best when you have a problem that can be measured or quantified in some way.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a statement that provides an educated prediction or proposed solution. A good format for a hypothesis would be, “If we do XX, then YY will happen.” Remember, the hypothesis should be measurable so it can help you solve the business problem identified in step one.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Test the hypothesis by conducting an experiment. This is when an activity is created to confirm (or not confirm) the hypothesis. There have been entire books written about conducting experiments. We won’t be going into that kind of depth today but it’s important to keep in mind a few things when conducting your experiment:
</p><p>
</p><p>The experiment must be fair and objective. Otherwise, it will skew the result.
</p><p>
</p><p>It should include a significant number of participants or it will not be statistically representative of the whole.
</p><p>
</p><p>Allow for ample time to collect the information.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Analyze the data. Once the experiment is complete, the results can be analyzed. The results should either confirm the hypothesis as true or false. If by chance, the results aren’t confirmed, this doesn’t mean the experiment was a failure. In fact, it might give you additional insight to form a new hypothesis. It reminds me of the famous Thomas Edison quote, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Communicate the results. Whatever the result, the outcomes from the experiment should be communicated to the organization. This will help stakeholders understand which challenges have been resolved and which need further investigation. It will create buy-in for future experiments. Stakeholders might also be in a position to help develop a more focused hypothesis.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now let’s use the scientific method in a business example:

</p><p>Step 1 (identification): Human resources has noticed an increase in resignations over the past six months. Operational managers have said that the company isn’t paying employees enough. The company needs to figure out why employees are resigning?

</p><p>Step 2 (hypothesis): If we increase employee pay, then fewer resignations will occur.
</p><p>
</p><p>Step 3 (test): For the next three months, HR will have a third-party conduct exit interviews to determine the reason employees are resigning.
</p><p>
</p><p>Step 4 (analysis): The third-party report shows that the primary reason employees are leaving is because health care premiums have increased and coverage has decreased. Employees have found new jobs with better benefits.

</p><p>I’ve found using the scientific method to be very helpful in situations like the example where a person or small group have a theory about how to solve a problem. But that theory hasn’t completely been bought into by everyone. Offering the option to test the proposed solution, without a full commitment, tells the group that their suggestion is being heard and that the numbers will ultimately provide insight – after the full scientific method has been followed.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Over the last few decades, it is an irrefutable point that the environment is exposed to many dangers. These dangers are tremendously progressed due to advanced processes which caused myriad issues. In this essay, I will discuss the causes that are harming the environment and I will determine who should struggle against them.</p><p></p><p>To begin with, there are many behave and reasons in the environment which cause inevitable consequences such as pollution. First and foremost, the factories which are producing black smokes are the very effective reason, they make no efforts to minimize the pollution. In addition, the vital and common issue is greenhouses emissions. Moreover, there are not enough studies in this field. Hence, people still don’t have the awareness to protect the environment. At last but not least, the garbage is being burned commonly causing serious consequences.</p><p></p><p>Further reinforcing, many sides share the responsibility with different percentages. Firstly, the governments are the first responsible party since they have the ability to stop these behave legally. Also, the individuals who share in climate change causes. For instance, the owners of greenhouses. Furthermore, the scientists and researchers, because they have not used their skills to enrich this vital issue with solutions.</p><p></p><p>Thus, In conclusion, we can say that it is our responsibility to protect our environment and to save our mother earth from being deteriorated.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>There is no denying that our mother earth is in danger and this is something that each one of us knows. The occurrence of natural calamities like Tsunami has increased multifold in the past decade inviting experts views to outline the underlying causes of this problem and what can be done to combat this.</p><p></p><p>{Causes}</p><p></p><p>The foremost reason that poses the serious threat to our environment is the harmful gases present in the air. In the past decade, the uncontrolled use of automobiles has increased multifold which in turn emits harmful gases like Carbon monoxide. The electronic appliances of our daily use like air conditioners and refrigerators also contaminate air by the discharge of harmful substances. The diverse effect of these gases leads to air pollution and global warming.</p><p></p><p>Deforestation is another major cause. The human population is increasing at a fast rate and to meet their daily consumption forests and trees are being cut down. Be it for home or fuel, the man is causing great loss to the environment. Other known causes are the depletion of natural resources like water, fuel, and food. The over-consumption of resources by the humans and improper waste disposal have resulted in increasing volumes of solid and hazardous wastes that pose major threats to the environments.</p><p></p><p>{Solutions}</p><p></p><p>It is mainly due to human activities that the planet has reached unsustainable levels and now it is our duty and responsibility to lower the loss that has been already done to nature. Every individual could play a significant role to combat this problem.</p><p></p><p>We use the enormous amount of plastic in our daily life so let’s say ‘No’ to plastics. Instead of plastic, we can make use of Eco-friendly substitutes that are readily available everywhere. For example: Use paper and cloth bags for shopping.</p><p></p><p>The government of every country should implement strict laws for industries that inhibit the release of the toxic wastes and proper waste management. The awareness programs should be organized to encouraging citizens to use more of public transport and plant trees in their neighborhood. The less use of private vehicles will substantially reduce the emission of fossil fuels thereby playing a vital role in addressing this issue.</p><p></p><p>{Conclusion}</p><p></p><p>At the end, I can say that it is the responsibility of each one of us to do our bit for the environment. Let’s work together towards a greener and more sustainable future.</p><p></p><p>I also think that overfishing in oceans can cause adverse effects on marine life that could also cause a threat on our environment .For example ,, it can cause an imbalance which erodes the foodweb causing death of some marine life or starving.Overfishing can also alter the size of the remaining fish and the rate at which they reproduce ..Hence ,,a solution here is to educate the public on effects of overfishing.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One and a common problem about teenagers nowadays is a Social Media Addiction.
