Which conditiondoes not distinctly describe an El Niño event?A. It is an oscillation of the ocean-temperature system in the tropical Pacific having important consequences for weatherand climate around the globe.B. The trade winds blow towards the west across the tropical Pacific. These winds pile up warm surface water in the westPacific, so that the sea surface is about 1/2 meter higher at Indonesia than at Ecuador.C. The trade winds relax in the central and western Pacific leading to a depression of the thermocline in the easternPacific, and an elevation of the thermocline in the west.D.

                                            Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</a>

                                            If i were to ask you a question, will you be able to answer those accurately?It's all about life; reborn, reincarnation, or somewhat a timetravelling. I just want to explore through your minds, i wanna know what are your thoughts to the question i will ask for you. In addition, I want to be fair so I'm going to add an additional points ^^ so here's the question:REBORN1. In your past life, you died once. You were given a chance to live again in order to correct all those misunderstanding that has happened in the past. What will you do now that you have learned all the things that has happened to you? Will you just let bygones be bygones? answer.REINCARNATION2. You reincarnated not only once but twice, the reincarnation that has happened to you twice in your life was really unfortunate. You didn't do a good deeds thus you did a bad one. What happened to you in your first reincarnation has also fated to be the same as the second reincarnation. Now that you're reincarnated for the third time, will you correct all your mistakes that you have done in your past life now that you've given a another chance? Will you still do the same?(oof it's actually tiring to type this long uwu &gt;•&lt;)Now here comes the interesting one *inserting a devil smile* :&gt;TIMETRAVELLING3. Comes to the weird and unfamilliar surroundings, old but elegant things are displayed. You suddenly realized that you're not in your house but you're in SOMEBODY'S house. Elegant house, beautiful views ANNDD you have actually mistaken into someone. That someone is whom highly respected and you knew from the start that you actually don't know where you are now. You ask some people around you what date is it now and suddenly you were shocked by its answer. Now that it slipped through your mind that you are in TimeTravel, what will you do in order to go back in modern/old times? Will you continue to live in those period as someone? 3 question in a rowww HAHA. the last question is a little bit complicated but who knows whether you understand the question or not:&gt;. I just hope you will answer this honestly, you don't need to prove to me that you're a genius or whatever, what i need is if someone out there may answer this correctly or honestly it means that person has a great comprehension. no need to pressure yourself, I also just want to express my thoughts by asking these questions:)goodluck! thank you for giving me your time^^​</a>

                                            What’s New Activity 3: Read Me Reading Text No.1 
 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</a>

The local villagers had noticed her house seemed brighter at night even though there was no electricity. According to rumors some had even seen dwarfs helping a mysterious and beautiful girl at night. No one ever discovered the source of the mysterious night time glow. She lived in the forest on the outskirts of a fishing village and was famous for her beautiful flowers. The fisherman would barter their treasured catch for her flowers. A young couple came to visit the village. They were haughty and were not around from around there. A proud pair that hated anything they thought was ugly. They would make fun of anything they thought was ugly. They were out exploring the village one day and came upon the old woman in the forest. Since they found her ugly, they mocked her. After making fun of her, the old woman asked them to leave but they refused. To punish them, she said "Since you only like beautiful things I will turn you into the most beautiful insect."

                                            The Gift of the Magi
O. Henry
The story opens with $1.87. That's all Della Dillingham Young has to buy a present for her beloved husband, Jim. And the next day is Christmas. Faced with such a situation, Della promptly bursts into tears on the couch, which gives the narrator the opportunity to tell us a bit more about the situation of Jim and Della. The short of it is they live in a shabby flat and they're poor. But they love each other. Once Della's recovered herself, she goes to a mirror to let down her hair and examine it. Della's beautiful, brown, knee-length hair is one of the two great treasures of the poor couple. The other is Jim's gold watch. Her hair examined, Della puts it back up, sheds a tear, and bundles up to head out into the cold. She leaves the flat and walks to Madame Sofronie's hair goods shop, where she sells her hair for twenty bucks. Now she has $21.87 cents. With her new funds, Della is able to find Jim the perfect present: an elegant platinum watch chain for his watch. It's $21, and she buys it. Excited by her gift, Della returns home and tries to make her now-short hair presentable (with a curling iron). She's not convinced Jim will approve, but she did what she had to do to get him a good present. When she finishes with her hair, she gets to work preparing coffee and dinner. Jim arrives at 7pm to find Della waiting by the door and stares fixedly at her, not able to understand that Della's hair is gone. Della can't understand quite what his reaction means. After a little while, Jim snaps out of it and gives Della her present, explaining that his reaction will make sense when she opens it. Della opens it and cries out in joy, only to burst into tears immediately afterward. Jim has given her the set of fancy combs she's wanted for ages, only now she has no hair for them. Jim nurses Della out of her sobs. Once she's recovered she gives Jim his present, holding out the watch chain. Jim smiles, falling back on the couch. He sold his watch to buy Della's combs, he explains. He recommends they put away their presents and have dinner. As they do so, the narrator brings the story to a close by pronouncing that Della and Jim are the wisest of everyone who gives gifts. They are the magi.
Analytical Questions:
1. Does the story end the way that you expect? Why or why not?
2. What aspects of the story would be revealed or hidden if it were told from another point of view? For instance, how would the story change if it were told completely from Jim’s perspective?
3. How would the story change if the setting were different? Would this be an effective story if it were set in today’s time?
4. Pretend that Jim sold his gold watch in a newspaper ad instead. Write the newspaper ad for Jim’s gold watch. What details would he include? Would he divulge the reasoning behind him selling his possession?
5. If Della had had short hair in the beginning of the story, what do you think that she would have done/sold in order to pay for the gold chain? Why do you think so?</a>

1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</a>

                                            1.Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells of animals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When this happens, the virus uses the cell’s chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible for causing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. In conclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.

2.Some scientists claim that Corona Virus can be airborne. However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.

4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.

                                            Which three pieces of evidence support the idea that the people do not know what the star is?
 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</a>

This was also a sign of cooperation and goodwill between the two major working sectors of the town, the farmers and the fishermen. It was however a drunken guest, during a certain affair which decided on the final name, who said "Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga taga-Palanyag! (Long live Palanyag and the people of Palanyag!)"

The gisaeng class, although usually refined and cultured, were viewed with contempt by the noble and upper classes. Wolmae, eager to escape her low status, worked her way into the heart of a civil minister, who eventually took her as his second wife. Wolmae then gave birth to a daughter whom she named Chunhyang, meaning “scent of spring.”Some 16 years later, Yi Mong-ryong, the son of the district magistrate, was out for a walk, taking in the spring beauty, when he spotted a girl on a swing. She was the loveliest sight he’d ever beheld. Desperate to meet the lovely woman, Mong-ryong sent his servant to arrange a meeting with her. Although reluctant at first, Chunhyang agreed to meet her suitor at Gwanghallu Pavilion, a popular leisure spot.Although Chunhyang remained aloof, Mong-ryong was wholly smitten. He instantly decided he wanted to marry her, and went to Wolmae to ask for permission. Aware that marrying into a prestigious family could lead to a better life, Wolmae gave her full approval. Constricting traditions, however, prevented Mong-ryong from wedding until he passed the civil service exam. Fortunately, however, Chunhyang eventually saw the sincerity of Mong-ryong’s passion and fell in love with him. For a sweet, short while, the two lived a happy, peaceful existence while Mong-ryong studied for his exam.Then one day, Mong-ryong’s father brought misfortune to the loving couple by getting promoted to a position in Seoul, requiring him and his family to relocate. Because Chunhyang was the daughter of a gisaeng, Mong-ryong’s father made it very clear that they couldn’t risk their family honor by taking her with them. Soaked in tears, Mong-ryong and Chunhyang embraced each other and said their goodbyes, promising to remain true until their reunion. Mong-ryong vowed to pass his exams, earn a respectable title and come back to marry Chunhyang with honor.Upon leaving, Mong-ryong’s father was soon replaced by a new magistrate, Byeon Hak-do, who was greedy and licentious. He ignored his duties and exploited the local population to feed his private appetites. After witnessing Chunhyang’s beauty, he demanded that she sleep with him, but she adamantly refused, declaring she had only one true love. Infuriated, Hak-do tortured her and threw her in prison. After a few months, just as Chunhyang was on the verge of death, Mong-ryong returned, with a respectful title as he had promised.Before ousting Hak-do and freeing several political prisoners, he disguised himself as a homeless man and approached Chunhyang to see how she’d treat him. She was polite and kind, but made it very clear that she had only one true love. When Mongryong finally revealed himself, the two lovers kissed and embraced each other, rejoicing in their reunion. After righting the wrongs of Hak-do, Mong-ryong made Chunhyang his official bride and took her with him to Seoul, where the king rewarded Mong-ryong’s accomplishments with a promotion. They lived happily ever after.​</a>

They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When this happens, the virus uses the cell’s chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible for causing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. In conclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.a.

                            6. Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</h2><br />

                            7. If i were to ask you a question, will you be able to answer those accurately?It's all about life; reborn, reincarnation, or somewhat a timetravelling. I just want to explore through your minds, i wanna know what are your thoughts to the question i will ask for you. In addition, I want to be fair so I'm going to add an additional points ^^ so here's the question:REBORN1. In your past life, you died once. You were given a chance to live again in order to correct all those misunderstanding that has happened in the past. What will you do now that you have learned all the things that has happened to you? Will you just let bygones be bygones? answer.REINCARNATION2. You reincarnated not only once but twice, the reincarnation that has happened to you twice in your life was really unfortunate. You didn't do a good deeds thus you did a bad one. What happened to you in your first reincarnation has also fated to be the same as the second reincarnation. Now that you're reincarnated for the third time, will you correct all your mistakes that you have done in your past life now that you've given a another chance? Will you still do the same?(oof it's actually tiring to type this long uwu &gt;•&lt;)Now here comes the interesting one *inserting a devil smile* :&gt;TIMETRAVELLING3. Comes to the weird and unfamilliar surroundings, old but elegant things are displayed. You suddenly realized that you're not in your house but you're in SOMEBODY'S house. Elegant house, beautiful views ANNDD you have actually mistaken into someone. That someone is whom highly respected and you knew from the start that you actually don't know where you are now. You ask some people around you what date is it now and suddenly you were shocked by its answer. Now that it slipped through your mind that you are in TimeTravel, what will you do in order to go back in modern/old times? Will you continue to live in those period as someone? 3 question in a rowww HAHA. the last question is a little bit complicated but who knows whether you understand the question or not:&gt;. I just hope you will answer this honestly, you don't need to prove to me that you're a genius or whatever, what i need is if someone out there may answer this correctly or honestly it means that person has a great comprehension. no need to pressure yourself, I also just want to express my thoughts by asking these questions:)goodluck! thank you for giving me your time^^​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I'll try my very best to be a better person with all those knowledge. I would dare to change myself for the better, and use all those awareness as my guide.</p><p></p><p>2. I would live my life the way i wanted to. and won't really care if it'll change something or not. my third reincarnation may fail, but I'll sure make it worth it.</p><p></p><p>3. I would rather find my way back to time, and go back to my previous life. and if this thing i'm experiencing now is probably the future. i want to know how it happens.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>MOOH</p><br />

                            11. What’s New Activity 3: Read Me Reading Text No.1 
 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

                            15. How did Juan achieve the comforts in life? Do you think
he would still have experienced the same comforts had he
not encountered the magic tree? Explain your answer.
The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</h2><br />

                            20. Once upon a time in the Philippines there was an old woman with strange magical qualities. The local villagers had noticed her house seemed brighter at night even though there was no electricity. According to rumors some had even seen dwarfs helping a mysterious and beautiful girl at night. No one ever discovered the source of the mysterious night time glow. She lived in the forest on the outskirts of a fishing village and was famous for her beautiful flowers. The fisherman would barter their treasured catch for her flowers. A young couple came to visit the village. They were haughty and were not around from around there. A proud pair that hated anything they thought was ugly. They would make fun of anything they thought was ugly. They were out exploring the village one day and came upon the old woman in the forest. Since they found her ugly, they mocked her. After making fun of her, the old woman asked them to leave but they refused. To punish them, she said "Since you only like beautiful things I will turn you into the most beautiful insect."

                            21. The Gift of the Magi
O. Henry
The story opens with $1.87. That's all Della Dillingham Young has to buy a present for her beloved husband, Jim. And the next day is Christmas. Faced with such a situation, Della promptly bursts into tears on the couch, which gives the narrator the opportunity to tell us a bit more about the situation of Jim and Della. The short of it is they live in a shabby flat and they're poor. But they love each other. Once Della's recovered herself, she goes to a mirror to let down her hair and examine it. Della's beautiful, brown, knee-length hair is one of the two great treasures of the poor couple. The other is Jim's gold watch. Her hair examined, Della puts it back up, sheds a tear, and bundles up to head out into the cold. She leaves the flat and walks to Madame Sofronie's hair goods shop, where she sells her hair for twenty bucks. Now she has $21.87 cents. With her new funds, Della is able to find Jim the perfect present: an elegant platinum watch chain for his watch. It's $21, and she buys it. Excited by her gift, Della returns home and tries to make her now-short hair presentable (with a curling iron). She's not convinced Jim will approve, but she did what she had to do to get him a good present. When she finishes with her hair, she gets to work preparing coffee and dinner. Jim arrives at 7pm to find Della waiting by the door and stares fixedly at her, not able to understand that Della's hair is gone. Della can't understand quite what his reaction means. After a little while, Jim snaps out of it and gives Della her present, explaining that his reaction will make sense when she opens it. Della opens it and cries out in joy, only to burst into tears immediately afterward. Jim has given her the set of fancy combs she's wanted for ages, only now she has no hair for them. Jim nurses Della out of her sobs. Once she's recovered she gives Jim his present, holding out the watch chain. Jim smiles, falling back on the couch. He sold his watch to buy Della's combs, he explains. He recommends they put away their presents and have dinner. As they do so, the narrator brings the story to a close by pronouncing that Della and Jim are the wisest of everyone who gives gifts. They are the magi.
Analytical Questions:
1. Does the story end the way that you expect? Why or why not?
2. What aspects of the story would be revealed or hidden if it were told from another point of view? For instance, how would the story change if it were told completely from Jim’s perspective?
3. How would the story change if the setting were different? Would this be an effective story if it were set in today’s time?
4. Pretend that Jim sold his gold watch in a newspaper ad instead. Write the newspaper ad for Jim’s gold watch. What details would he include? Would he divulge the reasoning behind him selling his possession?
5. If Della had had short hair in the beginning of the story, what do you think that she would have done/sold in order to pay for the gold chain? Why do you think so?</h2><br />

1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</h2><br />

                            23. 1.Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells of animals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When this happens, the virus uses the cell’s chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible for causing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. In conclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.

2.Some scientists claim that Corona Virus can be airborne. However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.

4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.

                            25. Which three pieces of evidence support the idea that the people do not know what the star is?
 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</h2><br />

Palanyag, the old name for the city of Parañaque, generally means "my beloved", among other definitions, for as far as its residents are concerned, this best describes their affection for their hometown. Another version came from the combination of the terms "palayan" and "palalayag", the former meaning rice fields of which the city once abounded in and the latter pertaining to the sailing and fishing occupation of many of its residents. This was also a sign of cooperation and goodwill between the two major working sectors of the town, the farmers and the fishermen. It was however a drunken guest, during a certain affair which decided on the final name, who said "Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga taga-Palanyag! (Long live Palanyag and the people of Palanyag!)"

Little did they imagine that someday, the small wooden chapel would transform into the biggest shrine in the world dedicated to Our Mother of Perpetual Help. Little did they imagine that someday, Baclaran would transform into a booming town and an international pilgrim center The phenomenon exploded after the Redemptorists began the novena in 1948. Only 70 people attended the first novena. After a week, the number of devotees doubled. After several weeks, it came to a thousand. After a few months, it came to several thousands.

                            28. Directions:Read the following story from Korea and as you read observe what you can learn about the culture, tradition, beliefs, and attitudes of the Koreans and try to compare and contrast it to the Filipino practices.There once was a gisaeng, or female musician/entertainer, named Wolmae, who lived in Namwon, Jeollabuk-do. The gisaeng class, although usually refined and cultured, were viewed with contempt by the noble and upper classes. Wolmae, eager to escape her low status, worked her way into the heart of a civil minister, who eventually took her as his second wife. Wolmae then gave birth to a daughter whom she named Chunhyang, meaning “scent of spring.”Some 16 years later, Yi Mong-ryong, the son of the district magistrate, was out for a walk, taking in the spring beauty, when he spotted a girl on a swing. She was the loveliest sight he’d ever beheld. Desperate to meet the lovely woman, Mong-ryong sent his servant to arrange a meeting with her. Although reluctant at first, Chunhyang agreed to meet her suitor at Gwanghallu Pavilion, a popular leisure spot.Although Chunhyang remained aloof, Mong-ryong was wholly smitten. He instantly decided he wanted to marry her, and went to Wolmae to ask for permission. Aware that marrying into a prestigious family could lead to a better life, Wolmae gave her full approval. Constricting traditions, however, prevented Mong-ryong from wedding until he passed the civil service exam. Fortunately, however, Chunhyang eventually saw the sincerity of Mong-ryong’s passion and fell in love with him. For a sweet, short while, the two lived a happy, peaceful existence while Mong-ryong studied for his exam.Then one day, Mong-ryong’s father brought misfortune to the loving couple by getting promoted to a position in Seoul, requiring him and his family to relocate. Because Chunhyang was the daughter of a gisaeng, Mong-ryong’s father made it very clear that they couldn’t risk their family honor by taking her with them. Soaked in tears, Mong-ryong and Chunhyang embraced each other and said their goodbyes, promising to remain true until their reunion. Mong-ryong vowed to pass his exams, earn a respectable title and come back to marry Chunhyang with honor.Upon leaving, Mong-ryong’s father was soon replaced by a new magistrate, Byeon Hak-do, who was greedy and licentious. He ignored his duties and exploited the local population to feed his private appetites. After witnessing Chunhyang’s beauty, he demanded that she sleep with him, but she adamantly refused, declaring she had only one true love. Infuriated, Hak-do tortured her and threw her in prison. After a few months, just as Chunhyang was on the verge of death, Mong-ryong returned, with a respectful title as he had promised.Before ousting Hak-do and freeing several political prisoners, he disguised himself as a homeless man and approached Chunhyang to see how she’d treat him. She was polite and kind, but made it very clear that she had only one true love. When Mongryong finally revealed himself, the two lovers kissed and embraced each other, rejoicing in their reunion. After righting the wrongs of Hak-do, Mong-ryong made Chunhyang his official bride and took her with him to Seoul, where the king rewarded Mong-ryong’s accomplishments with a promotion. They lived happily ever after.​</h2><br />

                            30. 1.Viruses refer to infectious microscopic organisms that multiply only in living cells of animals, plants, or bacteria. They replicate themselves by integrating into the cell. When this happens, the virus uses the cell’s chemical machinery to keep itself alive. Viruses are responsible for causing many diseases such as measles, chicken pox, common colds, SARS, and COVID-19. In conclusion, viruses are microorganisms that harm other living things.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description2.Some scientists claim that Corona Virus can be airborne. However, World Health Organization (WHO) clarifies that the virus can be transmitted through aerosolized respiratory droplets. It means that a person can primarily get the virus through droplets coming from the infected person who coughs, sneezes or talks. The person can get the virus if he or she is within 6 ft. perimeter, does not have face mask, and inhaled the droplets. Also, people can be infected by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Therefore, the primary mode of transmission is through droplets.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description3. Because of COVID-19 pandemic, there are safety protocols that must be followed when entering some establishments. First you must wear face mask and face shield. Next, present your quarantine pass. Then, the personnel will check your temperature. If your body temperature is 37°C and below, you can enter the establishment. After that, you will fill out a form asking for your contact information. Once done, you can proceed with your transaction but you will be asked to observe social distancing. These measures must be followed to ensure your safety and to avoid getting the virus.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg. Classificationh. Description4. As COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow, comparisons have been drawn between COVID-19 and SARS. These viruses have similarities and differences in terms of their symptoms and transmission. Both viruses have common symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, other symptoms like fever and chest pain are commonly experienced in SARS while sore throat and runny nose are observed in COVID-19. In terms of transmission, both viruses can be spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. However, COVID-19 has a wider scope of transmission than SARS because the droplets from a COVID-19 infected person can reach up to 6 feet while the droplets from a SARS infected person can only reach up to 3 feet. To sum up, even though COVID-19 and SARS have differences, both are still deadly to humanity.a. Narrationb. Definitionc. Exemplificationd. Processe. Compare/Contrastf. Cause &amp; Effectg.

Filipinos have valued more the presence of the family members and enjoy the time together. Also, the crisis made their faith to God stronger. Further, they have better realized the importance of proper hygiene, good nutrition, and a clean environment. This led to a positive habit formation that protects themselves and their loved ones.
