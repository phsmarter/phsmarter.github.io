It is obvious that the cons of plastic bag usage outweigh the pros, yet our Earth is still being consumed by the infamous plastic bag. Many people have voiced their opinions on whether or not plastic bags should be taxed, although the input of their opinions does nothing but stir the pot since no one can reach a general consensus on how to handle this increasing dispute. Consumer behavior also contributes to deciding upon the plastic bag debate.  Consumer’s heavy dependence on these bags has a distinct impact on the environment and all of Earths living things. </p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                            4. persuasive essay about War on drugs (introduction, body, conclusion)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The War on Drugs is a global campaign that aims to eliminate the use and distribution of illegal drugs. This campaign is being implemented in many countries around the world, including the United States. The goal of the War on Drugs is to reduce drug abuse and addiction rates, prevent drug-related crimes, and increase public safety. However, despite the efforts of governments, this campaign has been criticized for its negative effects on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. In this essay, I will argue that the War on Drugs is a flawed campaign that has failed to achieve its goals and has caused more harm than good.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Firstly, the War on Drugs has failed to reduce drug use and addiction rates. Despite the billions of dollars spent on drug control and prevention programs, drug abuse and addiction rates continue to rise. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 19.3 million Americans aged 12 or older were current illicit drug users in 2020, representing 7.4% of the population. This suggests that the War on Drugs has been ineffective in addressing the root causes of drug abuse and addiction.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the War on Drugs has led to the criminalization and stigmatization of drug users, particularly those from marginalized communities. Instead of treating drug addiction as a public health issue, the War on Drugs has focused on punishing drug users and dealers, which has resulted in mass incarceration, police brutality, and human rights abuses. Moreover, drug laws are often enforced in a discriminatory manner, with people of color and low-income individuals being disproportionately targeted and penalized.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, the War on Drugs has fueled violence and corruption, particularly in countries where drug production and trafficking are prevalent. Drug cartels and organized crime groups have emerged as powerful forces, using violence and intimidation to maintain their dominance over the drug trade. This has not only caused harm to individuals and communities but also undermined the rule of law and democratic institutions.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, the War on Drugs is a failed campaign that has caused more harm than good. Its focus on punishment and prohibition has not only failed to reduce drug use and addiction rates but also led to the criminalization and stigmatization of drug users, violence, and corruption. Instead of continuing with the failed policies of the War on Drugs, governments should adopt evidence-based approaches that prioritize harm reduction, public health, and human rights. This includes investing in drug treatment and prevention programs, legalizing and regulating drugs, and addressing the social and economic factors that contribute to drug abuse and addiction.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I think it would be better if we should obey what are the new restrictions that they announced. It's afterall, for our own safety.</p><p></p><p>2. Even I, is not really that favorable about that said vaccine. But if we don't really have a choice, then so be it. Just make sure that it's safe enough not to kill humans. But well, if your time is now ticking, we won't able to stop that anymore, right? God's always here. Just trust him.</p><p></p><p>3. I know many people got fired or resign on their works and they can't do anything to have money but I think it's too much if we will use prohibited drugs to sell, it's inherently bad.
