He was a writer, known for El Filibusterismo (1962), Sisa (1951) and Noli Me Tangere (1930). He died on December 30, 1896 in Bagumbayan (now Luneta), Manila, Philippines. He was a skilled linguist; in his many travels in Europe and Asia, he was able to pick up the language of whatever country he visited and stayed for a protracted amount of time.

They had a son, but he died shortly after birth. Before he was executed on 30 December 1894, he requested to be shot facing the firing squad, and this had denied him, so they shot him in the back.

                            10. Name of Teacher: EVALUATION DIRECTIONS: Read and understand the biography of Jose Rizal. Answer the questions JOSE RIZAL Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines as Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda. He was a writer, known for El Filibusterismo (1962), Sisa (1951) and Noli Me Tangere (1930). He died on December 30, 1896 in Bagumbayan (now Luneta), Manila, Philippines. He was a skilled linguist; in his many travels in Europe and Asia, he was able to pick up the language of whatever country he visited and stayed for a protracted amount of time. He was also a talented artist, and there are sketches of his work which are still intact today. He was married to an Irish woman, Josephine Bracken, toward the end of his life. They had a son, but he died shortly after birth. Before he was executed on 30 December 1894, he requested to be shot facing the firing squad, and this had denied him, so they shot him in the back. Despite this, after the squad opened fire, Rizal summoned his strength and turned to face the soldiers, and then fell flat on his back with his eyes looking in the sky. 1. When was Jose Rizal executed? 2. How did he learn the different languages? 3. What point of view did the writer use in this selection? 4. What is the purpose of the author in writing the story? 5. If you were Jose Rizal, would you do the same as he did for the country?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. When was Jose Rizal executed? Dec 22, 1294_____DEC,22,1896__________2. How did he learn the different languages?___He received his informal education from his mother and his private tutors (1861-1870). On board the ship to Europe was a Japanese journalist who knew no other language than his own and Rizal acted as his interpreter. Is Betty White close to her stepchildren? He could converse in more than 10 different tongues.________ 3. What point of view did the writer use in this selection?__________________ 4. What is the purpose of the author in writing the story?_____________ 5. If you were Jose Rizal, would you do the same as he did for the country? ____If I were Dr. Jose Rizal, then I already had. And my only regret, to paraphrase, is that I only have one life to give to my country. Unless I’m Sylvester, then I’ll have nine.</p><p></p><p>But the bigger disappointment would be that Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo are more widely accepted, appreciated and studied abroad than in my own country. That the youth of my country doesn’t understand what sacrifice and patriotism are all about. As I look around my country today, all I see are more foreign cultural influences and less of my country’s.________.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sorry ung 3 and 4 ikaw nakakaalam nyan kase ikaw ung nag basa nyan eh</p><br />
