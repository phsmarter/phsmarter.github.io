                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Achieving Our dreams Today is like any other day of the year. Each day we wake up, shower, eat breakfast and start the day’s activities. Some of us go to our jobs, others go to school, and some do nothing. At the end of the day, we go to sleep. This is repeated every day, seven days a week, four weeks a month and 365 days a year. Life has become repetitive as if we are stuck on a hamster wheel. We have grown attached and comfortable in this tedious and repetitive cycle. Once you are stuck in this cycle, you lose motivation in developing your interests and shaping yourself. It is easy to be boxed in and nowhere to go. The people that I have grown with and the obstacles that I have faced throughout my life have molded the person you see in front of you today. Society has also played a big role in controlling the way we all act, think, and even dream. It is your world and your dreams; you should not live a life influenced by others. You certainly should not chase someone else’s dream because they want you to achieve what they were not able to achieve themselves.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>.</p><br />

In this pandemic, thousands of individuals have been infected with <strong>coronavirus </strong>and are either sick or dying as a result of the virus's spread. The most common symptoms of this viral infection, which can progress to pneumonia, are fever, cold, cough, bone pain, and breathing difficulties. Vaccines for this novel viral <strong>coronavirus </strong>illness, which is infecting people for the first time, are not currently available. As a result, severe measures like as keeping a tight hygiene regimen (e.g., routinely washing hands, avoiding face-to-face encounters, etc.), social isolation, and wearing masks, among other things, are being emphasized to avoid <strong>coronavirus</strong>.

                        <p><strong>Answer:Integrity is a broad-based word that has the potential to change human life. Usually, we use integrity only for truth.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>A person who is marching on the path of truth in life, never has to face great defeat.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>On the strength of truth, he continues to achieve partial successes in life.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Even in difficult circumstances, the human being holding the path of truth is not able to defeat any calamity and his unflinching thinking gives him the position of honorable and ideal in the rest of society.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Truth was a big contributor to the becoming great for leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Buddha, Mahavir, Swami Vivekananda, etc.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>They settled the truth in his heart and implemented the same.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The person who can change his character for wealth or give up his values, their actions prove to be extra ordinary on his own feet.

The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."
