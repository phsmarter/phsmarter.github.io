Some of the causes are increased use of energy, waste of energy, growing population, and the shortage of the common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. There is an increased use of energy because of more electrical appliances used in homes. The need for more appliances also creates a need for more electrical energy to make these appliances. Another reason for the increased use of energy is the need for more transportation. There is a waste of energy because people are careless and leave their lights and appliances on. There are, today, also more instant- on appliances for the convenience of users. The growing population creates a demand for more energy as more people use lights and other things that require fuel. The most common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas are used up rapidly and cannot be replaced immediately for it takes time to build these fuels. As a result of the energy crisis, there are power shortages and increase of prices.​</a>

They encounter with a variety of scenarios that might have a beneficial or negative impact on their lives. Today's children face social issues such as cyberbullying, teen pregnancy, and the need to "fit in"; life issues such as homelessness and absentee parents; and worldly issues such as crime in their areas. Because of today's society, children are exposed to far more and are far more advanced. Everything they want to know or see is at their fingertips, in the form of their cellphones. Their lives revolve around technology and quick access to information. Kids would rather be outside or reading a book than be on their mobile devices. Do today's children have inspirational role models to look up to? Growing up is the most difficult part of being a kid since there is no going back. We grow old as we get older, and as we get older, we die, and I don't think anyone wants to die. The most difficult aspect of being a child is having your parents exert control over you. They keep an eye on everything you do.

                            9. ACADEMIC WRITING Read the informative essay below and make a topic outline. Use the fo What are the causes and effects of the energy crisis? Some of the causes are increased use of energy, waste of energy, growing population, and the shortage of the common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. There is an increased use of energy because of more electrical appliances used in homes. The need for more appliances also creates a need for more electrical energy to make these appliances. Another reason for the increased use of energy is the need for more transportation. There is a waste of energy because people are careless and leave their lights and appliances on. There are, today, also more instant- on appliances for the convenience of users. The growing population creates a demand for more energy as more people use lights and other things that require fuel. The most common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas are used up rapidly and cannot be replaced immediately for it takes time to build these fuels. As a result of the energy crisis, there are power shortages and increase of prices.​</h2><br />
                         AnswerThe energy crisis is a global issue that has become increasingly relevant in recent years. The energy crisis refers to the shortage of energy resources and the high cost of obtaining and using them. The causes of the energy crisis are many and varied, but some of the most significant include increased use of energy, waste of energy, growing population, and the shortage of the common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.One of the main causes of the energy crisis is the increased use of energy. As the world population grows, so does the demand for energy. This demand is driven by the need for electricity, transportation, and heating and cooling. The increased use of energy has led to the depletion of non-renewable energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas. It has also increased the cost of obtaining these resources, making them less accessible to people with lower incomes.Another cause of the energy crisis is the waste of energy. Many people use much more energy than they need to, which leads to unnecessary consumption. This waste is often due to inefficient appliances, poor insulation, and other factors that increase energy usage. The waste of energy not only depletes the available resources but also contributes to environmental problems like air pollution and climate change.Growing population is also a cause of the energy crisis. As the world population grows, so does the demand for energy. This demand is driven by the need for food, housing, and transportation. The growing population puts pressure on the energy resources, leading to their depletion. It also contributes to environmental problems like air pollution and climate change.The shortage of the common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas is another significant cause of the energy crisis. These resources are finite, and their extraction and processing are becoming increasingly expensive. The shortage of these fuels has led to the development of alternative energy sources like solar and wind power.The energy crisis has several effects on society. One of the most significant effects is the high cost of energy. The high cost of energy affects people with lower incomes the most, making it difficult for them to obtain the necessary resources to meet their basic needs. The energy crisis also contributes to environmental problems like air pollution and climate change.In conclusion, the energy crisis is a global issue that has become increasingly relevant in recent years. The causes of the energy crisis are many and varied, but some of the most significant include increased use of energy, waste of energy, growing population, and the shortage of the common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. The energy crisis has several effects on society, including the high cost of energy and environmental problems like air pollution and climate change. Addressing the energy crisis requires a concerted effort by governments, individuals, and businesses to reduce energy usage, develop alternative energy sources, and create a more sustainable future for all. <br />

My parents too want me to be a doctor or a lawyer. But I wish to be neither of them. I wish to be a businessman.</p><p></p><p>As a businessman I can be independent, and rich. I shall not have to take orders from others. I shall look after my own business.

Being observant and willing to report out of the ordinary occurrences is a great way to stop crime in your neighborhood. As far as the police side of things, regular patrols through said neighborhoods can prevent crime in and of itself.</p><p> 4. As a rule, you probably cannot tell if someone will become a criminal. Most criminals are a product of the environment in which they are raised. For example, if they are neglected and the only family they can find are among the street gangs, then they are most likely going to turn to crime with their gang family.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand some people, for what reasons we don't completely understand will become the worst of all criminals, the serial killer. Some started off at a very young as age doing heinous things like killing animals or burying them alive. In some cases they became a danger to their own family. However, some seem to give no clue as to what goes on inside their heads. I am reminded of the I 5 killer. He seemed to be a nice kid, got good grades, played football for his high school, and his parents attended every game. He was not neglected, nor unloved.</p><p></p><p>Thankfully, most kids do grow up with no criminal intent. 0</p><p>   </p><p></p><p>SANA MAKATULONG HEHE&lt;//3</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: my mother</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A hero is a person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities. Most if not every person has their own hero, whether it be a celebrity, a family member, or some random person who you admire. My hero is someone who means the world to me and that is my mom. My mom is my hero, my idol, my model figure, my everything. I define my mom as a hero because she has provided me with guidance, motherly love, and has always been there for me. She has also supported me in every way possible. My mom is someone in my life that gives me a reason to live for and never give up. First of all, my mom is my hero because she has given me guidance and advice when I needed it the most. When having to make a hard decision</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>My mom has been with me since day one and that was when I was conceived. She has dealt with all my disasters and has seen me grow up making mistakes. Yet, she manages to find it within herself to love me and always stay close to me. My mom has rare ways to show me her love. For example, she would play around with me and act like someone my age would act. It makes me laugh so badly that I can’t help but let out tears of laughter. My mom always has those moments where she would try to do things to make me smile.</p><p></p><br />
