                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ionic bonding takes place when (d.) a metallic element like sodium transfers an electron to a non-metallic element like fluorine. Basically, ionic bonding requires an electron donor, often a metal, and an electron acceptor, a nonmetal.

                        <p><strong>                                          Explanation:</strong></p><p>There are two types of atomic bonds - ionic bonds and covalent bonds. They differ in their structure and properties. Covalent bonds consist of pairs of electrons shared by two atoms, and bind the atoms in a fixed orientation. Relatively high energies are required to break them (50 - 200 kcal/mol). Whether two atoms can form a covalent bond depends upon their electronegativity i.e. the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself. If two atoms differ considerably in their electronegativity - as sodium and chloride do - then one of the atoms will lose its electron to the other atom. This results in a positively charged ion (cation) and negatively charged ion (anion). The bond between these two ions is called an ionic bond.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

An element is the simplest form of matter that has a unique set of properties. One element cannot be chemically converted to another element.</p><p>2. Matter can be broken down into two categories: pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Mixtures are physically combined structures that can be separated into their original components. A chemical substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule.</p><p>5. To find out what water is made of, it helps to look at its chemical formula, which is H2O. This basically tells us that the water molecule is composed of two elements: hydrogen and oxygen or, more precisely, two hydrogen atoms (H2) and one oxygen atom (O). Hydrogen and oxygen are gases at room temperature.</p><p>6. Elements can be chemically combined into compounds, therefore, a compound consists of two or more elements combined, in definite proportions, by chemical means. Compounds may be formed by combining atoms of their constituent elements by ionic bonds or by covalent bonds.</p><p>8. An element is a pure substance and is made of only one type of atom; it cannot be broken down into a simpler substance.</p><p>9. Sodium chloride (chemical formula NaCl), known as table salt , rock salt, sea salt and the mineral halite, is an ionic compound consisting of cube-shaped crystals composed of the elements sodium and chlorine. </p><p>10. Most elements are solids, only 11 are gases and 6 are liquid. Examples of solid elements are sodium, carbon, aluminium. There are six liquid elements present in the periodic table. They are bromine , mercury , caesium , gallium , rubidium and francium. The gaseous element group; hydrogen (H), nitogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), chlorine ( Cl ) and noble gases helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), radon (Rn) are gases at standard temperature and pressure (STP).</p><p>12. An element is the simplest form of matter that has a unique set of properties. Examples of well-known elements include oxygen, iron, and gold (see the figure below). Elements cannot be broken down into a simpler substance. Likewise, one element cannot be chemically converted into a different element.</p><p></p><br />
