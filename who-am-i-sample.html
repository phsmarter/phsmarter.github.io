                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</a>

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Source:http://www.uwlux.edu/uploaded Files/Academics/Departments/Political_Science_and_Public_Admin/journal_article_critique_example.pdfType of Document:Purpose of the:Review:Writer’s Persona:Intended Reader:Strengths:Weaknesses:​</a>

                                            THE LEGEND OF THE SUGARCANE Once upon a time, there lived an old datu (chieftain). One day, he prayed to Bathala (God) saying, “I am getting older and weaker every day. As to my life here on earth, I find it increasingly boring to live on. Please allow me to ascend to heaven earlier!” Suddenly a voice said, “But your time on earth is not yet over.” The datu felt a little disappointed at this and left the palace, then went alone for a walk around the forest. Suddenly an old man came up to him. Knowing the grievance in his heart, the old man tried to cheer him up by saying, “It might surprise you to know, my Lord, that we can already find heaven on earth!” With that remark, he led the datu to a place where there grew a king plant that has a long tall body, with long leaves that looks very much like bamboo.” He went on to say, “This is a heavenly plant, try tasting its stem, it’s incredibly sweet.” The datu started to chew its stem and found it indeed to be very sweet. He really felt as if he’s gone to heaven. He also learned from the old man that the tall shoots are called tubo. The datu thanked the old man and took a sample of the purple-colored stalks home with him. From that time on, he ordered his people to plant more of this tubo, which we know it today as sugarcane which is still chewed or squeezed into cold drinks, or refined into brown and white sugar. COMPREHENSION CHECK: 1. What is the setting of the story? 2. Who is Datu in a certain tribe? 3. How does the datu feel about his life? 4. How does the old man cher up the datu? 5. What makes the tubo a heavenly plant?​</a>

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.
This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.
Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal.
It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts.
The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.
In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.
There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.

He could tell hisparents that he did not want to miss the fun since the Junior-Senior Prom could be his last schoolparty. He should apologize to his parents and promise that he would not violate the family curfew inthe future.For Dennis parents:They should listen to Dennis explanation.

Sample Campaign Speech
"To my beloved constituents, I am your most trusted and humble
servant. I am standing in front of you to strengthen the connection that we
have. I have been your Municipal Mayor for two consecutive terms and we
have been proactively building our shared dreams together for the benefit
of the municipality. You have been my living witness of the different
incredible projects constructed and substantial ordinances crafted and
implemented. And not to mention my unending hard work in leading our
progressive municipality. Allow me to recall those days when a horrible
earthquake struck our place, when a disastrous flood took away lives of our
loved ones and when we fought together to deplete corrupt elected officials
who once led the municipality. We were together during those times. I could
not forget how we hand in hand elevated the lives and morale of each other.
We were together as one!
Now, allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude for your support and
love. They said that there is no such thing as forever. Let me correct them.
Here in our municipality, forever is real! I have no doubt that you will forever
believe in our teamwork.

                                            SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</a>

I decided to write an extended essay on how hip-hop works as protest of the lower classes because I think the music is cool and really gets people dancing. inspiring those people who wouldn't normally think there's any point in being 10 Subject to futhation fox of complace, that material for first quarter at de kriends to pobko schoOS WITH: 20 pr of the Design of Courice LA APOY against anything to listen to the message. Being an enthusiastic hip-hop dancer myself, I really wanted to find out some more about this. 2. Biology has always been a passion of mine. Ever since I was searching for frogspawn in my grandparent's pond as a four-year-old and annoying my mom with a battery of jam jars on the window sill in which I was trying to raise tadpoles ! have been fascinated with observing nature in detail. Even in English, reading Death of a Naturalist Seamus Heaney, I found myself thinking up an experiment to do with dragonflies and fireflies. I have a fish tank at home with three different sorts of fish. I've noticed that they all respond differently when I feed them. I'm wondering what else is different in their behavior so, in this extended essay, I'm going to find out how they react to light. 3. When I go into a supermarket there is always gentle background music playing, although in the clothes shop I like it is always pop music. At breakfast my dad likes to listen to Apo Hiking Society, while my little brother has rock songs on his phone and will head bang his way through the dining area. My essay is trying to research why people rely on certain types of music to influence their mood and how music is used in this way for advertising. I am not sure if there is a connection and whether the music does affect, for example, people's shopping habits, but it will be interesting to try to find out, especially to see if different peoples' brains are wired differently when it com 1. 2. 3. pa help ​</a>

                            7. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</h2><br />

Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strongmethodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced. Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only-begotten ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due tologistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size. In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it. There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of Document:_____Purpose of the Review:_______Writer’s Persona:_____Intended Reader:_____Strengths:_____Weaknesses:______​</h2><br />

                            18. THE LEGEND OF THE SUGARCANE Once upon a time, there lived an old datu (chieftain). One day, he prayed to Bathala (God) saying, “I am getting older and weaker every day. As to my life here on earth, I find it increasingly boring to live on. Please allow me to ascend to heaven earlier!” Suddenly a voice said, “But your time on earth is not yet over.” The datu felt a little disappointed at this and left the palace, then went alone for a walk around the forest. Suddenly an old man came up to him. Knowing the grievance in his heart, the old man tried to cheer him up by saying, “It might surprise you to know, my Lord, that we can already find heaven on earth!” With that remark, he led the datu to a place where there grew a king plant that has a long tall body, with long leaves that looks very much like bamboo.” He went on to say, “This is a heavenly plant, try tasting its stem, it’s incredibly sweet.” The datu started to chew its stem and found it indeed to be very sweet. He really felt as if he’s gone to heaven. He also learned from the old man that the tall shoots are called tubo. The datu thanked the old man and took a sample of the purple-colored stalks home with him. From that time on, he ordered his people to plant more of this tubo, which we know it today as sugarcane which is still chewed or squeezed into cold drinks, or refined into brown and white sugar. COMPREHENSION CHECK: 1. What is the setting of the story? 2. Who is Datu in a certain tribe? 3. How does the datu feel about his life? 4. How does the old man cher up the datu? 5. What makes the tubo a heavenly plant?​</h2><br />

                            20. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.
This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.
Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal.
It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts.
The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.
In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.
There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.

Sample Campaign Speech
"To my beloved constituents, I am your most trusted and humble
servant. I am standing in front of you to strengthen the connection that we
have. I have been your Municipal Mayor for two consecutive terms and we
have been proactively building our shared dreams together for the benefit
of the municipality. You have been my living witness of the different
incredible projects constructed and substantial ordinances crafted and
implemented. And not to mention my unending hard work in leading our
progressive municipality. Allow me to recall those days when a horrible
earthquake struck our place, when a disastrous flood took away lives of our
loved ones and when we fought together to deplete corrupt elected officials
who once led the municipality. We were together during those times. I could
not forget how we hand in hand elevated the lives and morale of each other.
We were together as one!
Now, allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude for your support and
love. They said that there is no such thing as forever. Let me correct them.
Here in our municipality, forever is real! I have no doubt that you will forever
believe in our teamwork.

                            25. Activity 2: Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Type of DocumentPurpose of the ReviewWriter’s PersonaIntended ReaderStrengthsWeaknesses​</h2><br />

                            27. SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</h2><br />
