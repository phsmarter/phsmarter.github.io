                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Everyone feels sad sometimes, just like everyone can feel joyful, angry, proud and plenty of other emotions. In other words, everyone has feelings, and those feelings are always changing.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes we feel happy (such as when we’re having fun) and sometimes we feel sad (such as when we lose a loved one). Whatever the feelings, it is real and part of living. </p><p></p><p>A negative emotion may even help you. Our world focuses on happiness and treats unhappiness as an unnecessary or useless feeling. But sadness can slow you down, and make you really think about your life, your feelings and the people around you. It can help you keep sight of your relationships and dreams. </p><p></p><p>In other words, being sad doesn’t mean you are not coping with a situation. Rather, it helps you come to terms with that situation and move on. It is an important emotion that can help you adapt, accept, focus, persevere and grow.</p><p></p><p>And there’s more good news: you can learn to manage your sadness. </p><p>Life is full of situations that may make people feel sad:</p><p></p><p>having trouble at home (for example, family fights or domestic violence)</p><p>having trouble at school or work, or feeling pressure there </p><p>moving home</p><p>losing a loved one or a friend</p><p>being ill, or caring for someone who is ill</p><p>experiencing chemical changes in your body (from puberty, drugs or medicines)</p><p>experiencing changes in your thoughts (for example, developing an unhelpful thinking style such as being self-critical, or learning new information about subjects such as poverty or terrorism).</p><p>When you face these situations, you may have unhelpful or negative thoughts about your sadness. And those thoughts can make you feel worse. </p><p></p><p>So, try a different approach: try to acknowledge your sadness and the situation that prompted it. And give yourself time to deal with any problems and feel better. You also may want to call on resources that could help you (such as friends and family, a psychologist, or another health professional).</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan lng po sana makatulong</p><p></p><br />
