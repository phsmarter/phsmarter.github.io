                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a sense, debit cards work as a cross between ATM cards and credit cards. You can use them to get cash from a bank's automated teller machine, as with the former; or you can make purchases with them, like the latter. In fact, many financial institutions are replacing their plain vanilla, single-purpose ATM cards with debit cards that are issued by major card-payment processors such as Visa or Mastercard. Such debit cards come automatically with your checking account.</p><p></p><p>Whether being used to obtain cash or to buy something, the debit card functions in the same way: It draws the funds immediately from the affiliated account. So, your spending is limited to what’s available in your checking account, and the exact amount of money you have to spend will fluctuate from day to day, along with your account balance.</p><p></p><br />
