                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When you seek for information in the vast majority of search engines, you are most likely going to find a lot more information than you initially needed and it is a wonderful thing to be surrounded by all these legitimate sources of information, you are safe to rely on these articles officially published by different authors all around the world however can you really say that whatever you are reading right now as a source of information, legitimate? This is where the importance of using different sources of information especially in studying various topics of literacy comes in. The importance of using different sources of information is just as important as checking the legitimacy of an article, this however not only prevents the vile action of plagiarism from occurring but also creates a whole new outlook in certain topics which gives another idea to the important use of different sources of information from different articles. </p><br />
