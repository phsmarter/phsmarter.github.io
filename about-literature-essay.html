                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Literature broadly refers to any collection of written or oral work, but it more commonly and narrowly refers to writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry, in contrast to academic writing and newspapers.Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as autobiography, diaries, memoir, letters, and the essay, as well as in the disciplines of history and philosophy.Its Latin root literatura/litteratura (from littera: letter of the alphabet or handwriting) was used to refer to all written accounts. Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, which now includes electronic literature.</p><p></p><p>Literature is classified according to whether it is poetry, prose or drama, and such works are categorized according to historical periods, or their adherence to certain aesthetic features, or genre.English literature of the 16th century</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOT 500 WORDS ITHINK</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer and Explanation:</strong></p><p>It is the idea that in order to understand another culture we need to know about their literature. It has been my experience throughout college and now through graduate school that literature can help us better understand other cultures and people who are different from us. Phillipine literature has much to offer for people of all walks of life including young students, professors, parents, employers and students alike. APALA, the Association of Students and Teachers in Literature Academe, hosts a program called Cultural Intersection that provides people with the opportunity to understand our shared culture.<br />Only by learning about other cultures and their literature can we better understand one another. A better understanding of other cultures means not only understanding the other view but also being able to see how it is different. For example, many people may believe that Islam is a religion that promotes terrorism and killing.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Literature is a timeless piece of entertainment. As the innovations of technological advancements have grown, the way we read has revolutionised and evolved. However, the essence of storytelling and the effect it has on our lives hasn’t wavered.</p><p></p><p>Literature reflects human nature and a way we can learn and relate to others. By reading through a first-person perspective, we can fully immerse ourselves into a different mindset and figure out how others think and feel. This is important within today’s society as we’re becoming increasingly detached from human interaction through iPhones, FaceTime, and social media. Literature is something that will never change in the way it makes you feel, regardless of whether that’s on paper or as an eBook.</p><p></p><p>The 21st century in literature refers to world literature produced during the 21st century.

                            18. Essay all about the importance of literature</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Literature is the foundation of life.</strong></p><p><strong>Literature is the foundation of life.It places an emphasis on many topics from human tragedies to tales of the ever-popular search for love. ... Literature enables people to see through the lenses of others, and sometimes even inanimate objects; therefore, it becomes a looking glass into the world as others view it.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I HOPE THIS HELP </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Literature is an art form. It can be in the form of a poem, a prose, a story, a novel or a drama. It is the platform for an individual to express his thoughts or ideas through language. The written form of literature is as old as our civilization. In the history, writers used literature as a medium of communication to share their ideologies and opinions with the people.</p><p></p><p>importance of literature</p><p></p><p>We have a large number of renowned authors among which include William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen and so on. Literature is not all about creating an imaginary realm with words. It gives emphasis on all topics between life and death. It could be about a catastrophe, fortune, war, relationships, technology, politics or anything and everything that has happened or might happen in a society.</p><p></p><p>For an Empathetic Society</p><p>Literature is an inevitable medium to carve out an empathetic society. Through a written work or theatre art or drama, the society gets to witness the mishaps that have happened in the past to any society or a group of people. This enables them to understand the emotions felt by the character played in the work as if they themselves were a part of it. The difference between good and evil easily reach the audience or the readers through literature.</p><p></p><p>To Have a Better Understanding of Our History</p><p>We would have never learned about our predecessors if we did not have access to the ancient literary works. It has given us a wide knowledge about all the deeds that our ancestors have performed and experienced in their lives. Live our entire life striving to attain success and not know about our history definitely would have been a shame. We have only the literary works to thank for all the information provided to us.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>To Know Our World &amp; Society Better</p><p>Other than about you and your family, do you have any idea about even the lives of your neighbors? Even if not entirely about your neighbors, there are works created by great authors about both the good and bad things happening in our society. It could be about anything prevalent in our current world. Political satires, religious customs, and rituals, technological advancement, etc., are some of them. The right use of language encourages a person to work for or against such ideologies.</p><p></p><p>To Enhance Our Thinking Ability</p><p>Literary works, may it be an oral or a written work, often help to extend our thinking abilities. This is the main reason for which children are given storybooks to read. The plot and the pictures shown in the book help to develop the curiosity within them and try to think beyond what is written in the book. This enhances their ability to solve complex problems and extend their imaginations and ideas to a wider realm.</p><p></p><p>To Have a Deeper Knowledge Of Our Culture</p><p>There are a number of authors with the culture of a society as their main domain. To know more about our culture and the reason for practicing various rituals, literature helps us to a great extent. If there were no written evidence of our age-old cultures and beliefs, we would have had to blindly follow others who boast about their wide knowledge without any evidence.</p><p></p><p>To Have Better Writing Skills</p><p>Reading is the only option for you to improve your writing skills if you have the desire to be a writer. Through reading, you get to visualize the different styles of writing used by various writers. It helps you to think about how a literary piece of work should be written without ruining its authenticity.</p><p></p><p>Literature is thus an important link in maintaining empathy and harmony among human beings. It opens before us the door to an entirely different territory which didn’t even seem to exist before. Though it is physically impossible for us to live someone else’s life, literature helps us to develop our own perspective about the life experiences faced by a stranger. We understand the hardships, achievements and the pain inflicted on a person as if we ourselves have been experiencing them.</p><p></p><p>Though there are many libraries with a large collection of literary works of famous authors, our generation fails to give them proper acknowledgment. Rather than spending our time in reading a book, we find more relaxation in playing video games. By neglecting the literature, we are actually ruining any possibility of having a better understanding of human relationships. To be precise, there is no other power in the world capable of uniting people other than the power of language or Literature.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            22. write your reflection essay about pre-spanish literature?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PHILIPPINE MEDIA AND LITERATURE  DURING THE PRE-SPANISH ERA
</p><p>
</p><p>The following are accounts of existence and developments of Philippine literature from the Pre-Spanish Colonization:
</p><p>
</p><p>The Start of Recorded History
</p><p>
</p><p>The end of Philippine prehistory is April 21 900 AD, the date inscribed in the oldest Philippine document found so far, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription. From the details of the document, written in Kawi script, the bearer of a debt, Namwaran, along with his children Lady Angkatan and Bukah, are cleared of a debt by the ruler of Tondo. From the various Sanskrit terms and titles seen in the document, the culture and society of Manila Bay was that of a Hindu-Old Malay amalgamation, similar to the cultures of Java, Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra at the time. There are no other significant documents from this period of pre-Hispanic Philippine society and culture until the Doctrina Christiana of the late 16th century, written at the start of the Spanish period in both native Baybayin script and Spanish. Other artifacts with Kawi script and baybayin were found, such as an Ivory seal from Butuan dated to the early 11th century and the Calatagan pot with baybayin inscription, dated to the 13th century.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the years leading up to 1000 CE, there were already several maritime societies existing in the islands but there was no unifying political state encompassing the entire Philippine archipelago. Instead, the region was dotted by numerous semi-autonomous barangays (settlements ranging in size from villages to city-states) under the sovereignty of competing thalassocracies ruled by datus, rajahs or sultans or by upland agricultural societies ruled by “petty plutocrats”. States such as the Kingdom of Maynila, the Kingdom of Taytay in Palawan (mentioned by Pigafetta to be where they resupllied when the remaining ships escaped Cebu after Magellan was slain), the Chieftaincy of Coron Island ruled by fierce warriors called Tagbanua as reported by Spanish missionaries mentioned by Nilo S. Ocampo, Namayan, the Dynasty of Tondo, the Confederation of Madyaas, the rajahnates of Butuan and Cebu and the sultanates of Maguindanao and Sulu existed alongside the highland societies of the Ifugao and Mangyan. Some of these regions were part of the Malayan empires of Srivijaya, Majapahit and Brunei.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Kingdom of Tondo
</p><p>
</p><p>Since at least the year 900, the thalassocracy centered in Manila Bay flourished via an active trade with Chinese, Japanese, Malays, and various other peoples in East Asia. Tondo thrived as the capital and the seat of power of this ancient kingdom, which was led by kings under the title “Lakan” and ruled a large part of what is now known as Luzon from or possibly before 900 AD to 1571. During its existence, it grew to become one of the most prominent and wealthy kingdom states in pre-colonial Philippines due to heavy trade and connections with several neighboring nations such as China and Japan. In 900 AD, the lord-minister Jayadewa presented a document of debt forgiveness to Lady Angkatan and her brother Bukah, the children of Namwaran. This is described in the Philippine’s oldest known document, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription.
</p><p>
</p><p>Other facts:
</p><p>
</p><p> An Indigenous form of communication was already in existence evidenced by writings on barks and bamboos. News were also announced by an umalokohan or the town crier.
</p><p> Literature was already developing: forms included sabi, (maxim), bugtong (riddle), darangan (epic poetry), kumintang (war songs), and hudhud (wedding song).
</p><p>Historical Background
</p><p>
</p><p>Long time before the Spaniards and other foreigners landed on Philippine shores, our forefathers already had their own literature stamped in the history of our race. Our ancient literature shows our customs and traditions in everyday life as traced in our folk stories, old plays and short stories. Our ancient ancestors also had their own alphabet which was different from that brought by the Spaniards. The first alphabet used by our ancestors was similar to that of the Malayo-Polynesian alphabet. Whatever records our ancestors left were either burned by the Spaniards friars in the belief that they were works of the devil or were written on materials that easily perished, like the barks of trees, dried leaves and bamboo cylinders which could not have remained undestroyed even if efforts were made to preserve them. Other records that remained showed folk songs that proved the existence of a native culture truly our own. Some of these were passed on byword of mouth till they reached the hands of some publishers or printers who took interest in printing the manuscripts of the ancient Filipinos. The Spaniards who came to the Philippines tried to prove that our ancestors were really fond of poetry, songs, stories, riddles and proverbs which we still enjoy today and which serve to show to generations the true culture of our people.

                            23. make a essay about Revolutionary Literature and the different factors that influenced it.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Revolutionary literature is a form of literature that emerged during times of political, social, and economic upheaval. It is a genre that reflects the ideas, values, and aspirations of the people who lived through these tumultuous times. Revolutionary literature is often characterized by vivid imagery, passionate language, and a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>There have been many factors that have influenced the development of revolutionary literature throughout history. One of the most significant factors is the political climate of the time. For example, during the American Revolution, writers such as Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson wrote influential works that challenged the authority of the British monarchy and advocated for American independence. Similarly, during the French Revolution, writers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Victor Hugo wrote works that challenged the social and political order of their time.</p><p></p><p>Another factor that has influenced revolutionary literature is social and economic inequality. Writers often use literature as a tool to expose injustice, inequality, and oppression. For example, in the 19th century, writers such as Charles Dickens and Upton Sinclair wrote works that exposed the harsh realities of poverty and the exploitation of the working class. These works helped to raise awareness of social and economic issues and helped to inspire social movements for change.</p><p></p><p>Religion and spirituality have also played a significant role in the development of revolutionary literature. Many writers have used literature as a means of exploring religious and spiritual themes and questioning the role of religion in society. For example, during the Enlightenment period, writers such as Voltaire and Denis Diderot wrote works that challenged traditional religious beliefs and advocated for reason and science.</p><p></p><p>Finally, personal experience has also influenced the development of revolutionary literature. Many writers have drawn on their own experiences and struggles to create works that challenge established norms and empower marginalized groups. For example, in the 20th century, writers such as James Baldwin and Maya Angelou wrote works that explored issues of race and identity and helped to inspire the Civil Rights movement in the United States.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, revolutionary literature is a genre that has been shaped by many different factors throughout history. The political climate, social and economic inequality, religion and spirituality, and personal experience have all played significant roles in shaping this genre. Revolutionary literature has helped to inspire social movements and challenge established norms, and it continues to be an important tool for social and political change.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps.</p><br />
