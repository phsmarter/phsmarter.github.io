Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                                            Case Study: For Critical Analysis
 Mr. A B. C was brought to court for stealing. The court noted that he has been convicted for similar offenses many times. Can the court put him in prison at this time and with a much heavier penalty?
 Mr. A's defense lawyer argued on A's behalf that A should be spared from prison for he is a Kleptomania-defined as a strong compulsion to steal. Why do you think this qualification is relevant to the case?
 - In law, cases like this, e.g. Kleptomania, has its own appropriate sentence.
- In psychology, kleptomania is tantamount to mental illness and needs treatment.
- In philosophy, underlying question-human freedom and responsibility-need to be examined.
From the philosophical point of view, the case presented earlier takes on different path. Its method of inquiry is holistic and considers many perspective or theories on its approach in solving or assessing problems in society or activities of life. Precisely in real-life situations, one perspective is not enough to show the strength of our decision. Philosophy is about life, and it is for this reason that philosophy is considered a holistic discipline.
Going back to the example, the story of Mr. A B. C is classic example where seemingly there is a conflict between law and reason. As mandated by law, stealing is punishable by law. The saying says : “Dura lex, sed lex – the law is stiff, but it is the law.” The law may seem to be harsh, but it is the law. We live in a community of laws and not of men.
 However, the other context of positive laws that need to be stressed is not the punitive aspect of the law but the rehabilitative attribute. The consideration of mitigating circumstances are situations that need to be examined. Logic demands that no individual can be punished for acts that he has no control of. Thus in the case of Mr. A B. C, kleptomania and other similar acts, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, are mitigating circumstances that lessen responsibility and accountability, but they cannot remove one’s responsibility and accountability. Thus, individuals are still accountable in all their actions.
Based on the case study presented about the case of Mr. A B. C, answer these two fundamental questions:
1. If you were the judge, can you sentence Mr. A. B. C to prison at this time and with heavier penalty?
2. Can a person be accountable for his acts if these are beyond his control?</a>

The program involved extended and individualized support for employment candidates through a job support agency that maintained contact with candidates after initial job placement to offer support in various ways. I used a 50% random sampling of individuals who took part in the support program through the job support agency between April and October, and who fit the study criteria I developed from previous and similar studies.

Generally, older workers are more likely than workers of other ages to remain unemployed long term (Barrington 2015). Barrington (2015) suggests that ageist thinking is very much present in workplaces across America, and more supportive, inclusive workplaces are needed for older employees. Older women may be set at a further disadvantage because they tend to face additional discrimination based on gender (Barrnett 2005). (Source: Barrington, Linda. 2015.

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

1. Consultation from inexperience person may help in finding a current problem of discipline to be
solved, which may serve as basis for formulation of research problem.
2. Intuitions are considered good sources of knowledge as well as sources to find new research
problems.
3. Published Materials such as books and articles relating to the subject of our interest, including
research reports, opinion articles, and summaries of clinical issues, pertinent questions may arise
in our mind
4. If an existing theory is used in developing a researchable problem, a specific statement from the
theory must be isolated.
5. Brainstorming sessions are good techniques to find new questions, where an intensified
discussion among interested people of the profession is conducted to find more ideas to formulate
a good research problem.
6. Day-to-day practical experience of a researcher may serve as a good source of ideas to formulate
a research problem.
7. Discussion among friends can often spark our interest in a problem or provides us with the
reinforcers for pursuing a question, is an example practical experience.
8. Consultation with professionals in a specific field, study specialists, research associations, and
essay counselors will help you identify your problem area.
9. During field exposure, researchers get variety of experiences, which may provide plenty of ideas
to formulate research problems.

                            6. Case Study: For Critical Analysis
 Mr. A B. C was brought to court for stealing. The court noted that he has been convicted for similar offenses many times. Can the court put him in prison at this time and with a much heavier penalty?
 Mr. A's defense lawyer argued on A's behalf that A should be spared from prison for he is a Kleptomania-defined as a strong compulsion to steal. Why do you think this qualification is relevant to the case?
 - In law, cases like this, e.g. Kleptomania, has its own appropriate sentence.
- In psychology, kleptomania is tantamount to mental illness and needs treatment.
- In philosophy, underlying question-human freedom and responsibility-need to be examined.
From the philosophical point of view, the case presented earlier takes on different path. Its method of inquiry is holistic and considers many perspective or theories on its approach in solving or assessing problems in society or activities of life. Precisely in real-life situations, one perspective is not enough to show the strength of our decision. Philosophy is about life, and it is for this reason that philosophy is considered a holistic discipline.
Going back to the example, the story of Mr. A B. C is classic example where seemingly there is a conflict between law and reason. As mandated by law, stealing is punishable by law. The saying says : “Dura lex, sed lex – the law is stiff, but it is the law.” The law may seem to be harsh, but it is the law. We live in a community of laws and not of men.
 However, the other context of positive laws that need to be stressed is not the punitive aspect of the law but the rehabilitative attribute. The consideration of mitigating circumstances are situations that need to be examined. Logic demands that no individual can be punished for acts that he has no control of. Thus in the case of Mr. A B. C, kleptomania and other similar acts, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, are mitigating circumstances that lessen responsibility and accountability, but they cannot remove one’s responsibility and accountability. Thus, individuals are still accountable in all their actions.
Based on the case study presented about the case of Mr. A B. C, answer these two fundamental questions:
1. If you were the judge, can you sentence Mr. A. B. C to prison at this time and with heavier penalty?
2. Can a person be accountable for his acts if these are beyond his control?</h2><br />

</p><p></p><p>                -Kleptomania cannot be considered a legal defense to stealing – not even an insanity defense. Individuals are held responsible for their actions unless it can be clearly proven that they completely lack a sense self-control. The sentence is usually less time for a mental institution than a prison sentence.

This research paper explains the psychological and emotional effects of a support program for employees with mental illness. The program involved extended and individualized support for employment candidates through a job support agency that maintained contact with candidates after initial job placement to offer support in various ways. I used a 50% random sampling of individuals who took part in the support program through the job support agency between April and October, and who fit the study criteria I developed from previous and similar studies.

Generally, older workers are more likely than workers of other ages to remain unemployed long term (Barrington 2015). Barrington (2015) suggests that ageist thinking is very much present in workplaces across America, and more supportive, inclusive workplaces are needed for older employees. Older women may be set at a further disadvantage because they tend to face additional discrimination based on gender (Barrnett 2005). (Source: Barrington, Linda. 2015.
