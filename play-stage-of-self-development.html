Why or why not? Lead paragraph/ State problemVideo games have been very widely available these days, they have already replaced the physical contact games the previous generation used to enjoy. Acknowledge the other side Although there are benefits to name a few such as it develops critical thinking especially the adventure games wherein you need to solve a certain problem to advance to the next levels. As well as there is also a sense of team effort in games that involves 5 players to defend a particular kingdom and the like. Stress your side As for me, I won’t say that it’s a waste of time because if a gamer knows his limitations with regards to how long they play and to what extent their behavior is affected by such games, for example, I’ve noticed that some gamers have the tendency to be aggressive as an influence of the games. If they know how to handle their time well then that should be fine. Children nowadays should be given the autonomy to choose even at an early stage, it will develop a sense of independence and self-reliance later on in life. Furthermore, when the pandemic hit, of course, we are not allowed to go out so a lot of us stayed home. Aside from playing with our siblings and cousins since direct contact is not encouraged, many of us actually preferred to play video games. Offer a solution or call for action Gamers should know their limitations when playing. For example, they should only play for a maximum of 1-2 hrs a day and 2-3 x a week. They should set a time limit so as not to develop a psychological dependence to it. In addition they should prioritize their studies because that is the main goal, to finish school. Wrap your restate position. In conclusion, it is not a waste of time as long as the gamer knows how to limit his playing time. I understand that some people find playing games relaxing and it makes them able to cope more and enjoy. As long as their priority is their studies. Parents should also be involved, to guide them to make sure that they don’t spend excessive time playing video games.​</a>

                            15. what's your opinion on video games? are they a waste of time? Why or why not?Answer:What’s your opinion on video games? Are they a waste of time? Why or why not? Lead paragraph/ State problemVideo games have been very widely available these days, they have already replaced the physical contact games the previous generation used to enjoy. Acknowledge the other side Although there are benefits to name a few such as it develops critical thinking especially the adventure games wherein you need to solve a certain problem to advance to the next levels. As well as there is also a sense of team effort in games that involves 5 players to defend a particular kingdom and the like. Stress your side As for me, I won’t say that it’s a waste of time because if a gamer knows his limitations with regards to how long they play and to what extent their behavior is affected by such games, for example, I’ve noticed that some gamers have the tendency to be aggressive as an influence of the games. If they know how to handle their time well then that should be fine. Children nowadays should be given the autonomy to choose even at an early stage, it will develop a sense of independence and self-reliance later on in life. Furthermore, when the pandemic hit, of course, we are not allowed to go out so a lot of us stayed home. Aside from playing with our siblings and cousins since direct contact is not encouraged, many of us actually preferred to play video games. Offer a solution or call for action Gamers should know their limitations when playing. For example, they should only play for a maximum of 1-2 hrs a day and 2-3 x a week. They should set a time limit so as not to develop a psychological dependence to it. In addition they should prioritize their studies because that is the main goal, to finish school. Wrap your restate position. In conclusion, it is not a waste of time as long as the gamer knows how to limit his playing time. I understand that some people find playing games relaxing and it makes them able to cope more and enjoy. As long as their priority is their studies. Parents should also be involved, to guide them to make sure that they don’t spend excessive time playing video games.​</h2><br />
