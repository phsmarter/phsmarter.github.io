Her application to Brown University and her AP Art. History paper are both due on Monday. It's Sunday now. Phoebe makes a tough decision and plagiarizes the entire section on Impressionism on her paper, finishes her application and goes to bed. On Monday, Phoebe turns in her paper. By lunchtime, Phoebe's AP Art History teacher had asked to see her. He quickly realized the fact that a large portion of her paper was plagiarized and confronts. her about it. Phoebe bursts into tears and explains to him about all the pressures of being sick, taking five AP^ prime S , playing three varsity sports and being president of the student body. Brown is her number one choice for college and she felt she had to make a choice. Phoebe's teacher turns her in to the school honor council. She is very remorseful and volunteers to give a speech to the student body apologizing for what she has done. She also begs the honor council not to write to the colleges that she has applied to, as she has worked so hard throughout her high school career and is applying to the most competitive colleges and universities.

the most popular declamation pieces before a large crowd during their English
Fest.
2. Mr. Insong was scheduled for a teaching demonstration. He chose the topic he

goers.
4. Mommy Rose reads the story of “Pedro Pinduko” to baby Ralph.

7. Mirasol was heading home from work when Cecilia came up to her and asked
where she could find the nearest Palawan Pera Express Padala Center in the
area.
8. Vincent rehearsed his valedictory address weeks before the graduation. On the
day of the graduation, he delivered it without bringing any notes.
9. Mr. San Juan delivered an inspirational talk. In the beginning of his talk, he

of Dr. Eugene, being the guest of honor in their graduation rites.

Jeremias. Just as he was about to sit on his chair, his teacher asked him for his
reason for coming to class late.

and the dictated exam that Mrs. Lourdes, the TLE teacher, asked her to read

entourage, to go on stage and share to the group his fun memories with Denver,
the groom.
15.Mr. Jacaba was invited to talk about his struggles in life and how he managed to
overcome them. He was very certain what points he would include in his talk and

containing the outline of the points he wanted to discuss.</h2><br />

Morals build on this to form specific, context-driven rules that govern a person's behavior. They're formed from a person's life experience and are subject to opinion. (Kittlestad, n.d.) Identify the moral issue present in the text below with infographic on the other page. Then, underline 3 evidences to prove your answer. Phoebe is a senior and president of the student body. Lately she is becoming more and more overwhelmed by her rigorous AP course load and college applications. She has been sick for the past month and has fallen behind in many of her classes. Her application to Brown University and her AP Art. History paper are both due on Monday. It's Sunday now. Phoebe makes a tough decision and plagiarizes the entire section on Impressionism on her paper, finishes her application and goes to bed. On Monday, Phoebe turns in her paper. By lunchtime, Phoebe's AP Art History teacher had asked to see her. He quickly realized the fact that a large portion of her paper was plagiarized and confronts. her about it. Phoebe bursts into tears and explains to him about all the pressures of being sick, taking five AP^ prime S , playing three varsity sports and being president of the student body. Brown is her number one choice for college and she felt she had to make a choice. Phoebe's teacher turns her in to the school honor council. She is very remorseful and volunteers to give a speech to the student body apologizing for what she has done. She also begs the honor council not to write to the colleges that she has applied to, as she has worked so hard throughout her high school career and is applying to the most competitive colleges and universities.
