Make a diagram, a poster, a song, a poem, a dance, a meme, an artwork, a rap composition, a vlog or something academically acceptable that tell a message of hope or something positive to help solve social issues especially in time of crisis like the one brought by COVID-19 or those victims of calamity like typhoon Odette.

In applying what you learned into real life situations or concerns, just be honest and be sincere.

                            25. Performance Task.Reflect on how you are doing as a HUMSS student who is at the same time a child, a grandchild, a friend, a neighbor and has many roles to play in the society. Make a diagram, a poster, a song, a poem, a dance, a meme, an artwork, a rap composition, a vlog or something academically acceptable that tell a message of hope or something positive to help solve social issues especially in time of crisis like the one brought by COVID-19 or those victims of calamity like typhoon Odette. Make your work simple. A very short rap composition is enough. A stick-figure artwork or even a 2- minutes vlog is acceptable. Be creative and be nice to yourself. In applying what you learned into real life situations or concerns, just be honest and be sincere. Remember the principles and concept you learned about communication to deliver your message effectively.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a HUMSS student and a member of society, I believe that it is important to not only focus on academic achievements but also on our roles as children, grandchildren, friends, and neighbors.
