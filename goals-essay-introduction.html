                                            points) In Rizal’s own introduction printed at the start of the Noli Me Tangere, Rizal gives a clear
idea regarding the reason for his writing the Noli, “I shall do with you what was done in ages past with the
sick, who were exposed on the steps of the temple so that the worshippers, having invoked the God,
should each propose a remedy”. The task that Rizal saw clearly was the need to expose the cancers in
society. The cure or remedy will come from the Filipinos themselves. Comment on this in a short essay.

                        <p>Introduction</p><p></p><p>The Career Planning for Social Science unit has been an eye-opening experience for me. I have gained a deeper understanding of myself, my strengths, and my areas of development. Through the use of career development theory, I have been able to identify my intended career goals and the steps I need to take to achieve them. In this essay, I will reflect on my learning and development in this unit and discuss how it has helped me plan for my future.</p><p></p><p>What I Have Learned About Myself</p><p></p><p>One of the key things I have learned about myself is my personality type. Using the Holland's career development theory, I have discovered that I have a social personality type. This means that I enjoy working with people and helping them to solve problems. I also value social relationships and prefer jobs that involve interpersonal communication and collaboration. This has helped me to narrow down my career options and focus on jobs that align with my personality type.</p><p></p><p>Another thing I have learned about myself is my strengths and areas of development. Through the use of self-assessment tools such as SWOT analysis and skills inventory, I have been able to identify my strengths such as problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills. I have also identified areas that need improvement such as time management and networking skills. This has helped me to develop a plan to enhance my skills and address my development needs.</p><p></p><p>My Intended Career Goals</p><p></p><p>My intended career goal is to become a social worker. The inspiration for this career choice comes from my passion for helping people, particularly those who are vulnerable and marginalized in society. I believe that as a social worker, I can make a positive impact on people's lives by providing support, advocacy, and empowerment. I have also been inspired by the stories of social workers who have made a difference in their communities and have helped to bring about social change.</p><p></p><p>What I Need to Do to Achieve My Career Goals</p><p></p><p>To achieve my career goals, I need to acquire the necessary experience, skills, attributes, and qualifications. One of the things I need to do is to gain practical experience through internships and volunteering opportunities. This will provide me with an opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge and develop my skills in a real-world setting. I also need to develop my communication, networking, and time management skills to be an effective social worker.</p><p></p><p>In terms of qualifications, I need to complete a degree in social work and obtain a license to practice as a social worker. I also need to continue my professional development by attending workshops, seminars, and training programs to enhance my knowledge and skills. Additionally, I need to develop personal attributes such as empathy, compassion, and resilience to be able to work effectively with clients and manage the emotional demands of the job.</p><p></p><p>My Current Skills</p><p></p><p>Currently, I possess a range of skills that are relevant to my intended career as a social worker. I have strong communication skills, both verbal and written, which will be essential in working with clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. I also have good problem-solving skills, which will enable me to identify and address the needs of my clients. Additionally, I have leadership skills, which will be useful in managing teams and advocating for social change.</p><p></p><p>My PDP</p><p></p><p>My personal development plan (PDP) involves a range of activities that will help me to achieve my career goals. These include gaining practical experience through internships and volunteering, attending workshops and training programs, and developing personal attributes such as empathy and resilience. I also plan to improve my networking skills by attending networking events and building relationships with professionals in the field. Additionally, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a master's degree in social work to enhance my knowledge and skills.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Career Planning for Social Science unit has been a valuable learning experience for me. Through the use of career development theory, I have gained a deeper understanding of myself and my intended career goals. I have also developed a plan to achieve my career goals by acquiring the necessary experience, skills, attributes, and qualifications. I am confident that with the skills and knowledge I have gained in this unit, I will be able to make a positive impact on people's lives as a social worker.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
