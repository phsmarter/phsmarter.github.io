Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</h2><br />

In this narrative essay, we will explore the hypothetical scenario of a relationship never coming to be, and the potential consequences of that missed connection.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story:</p><p></p><p>It was a typical Friday night when we first crossed paths. I was out with some friends at a local bar, trying to forget about a recent breakup, when I saw him across the room. Our eyes met, and it was like everything else around us disappeared. We spent the rest of the night talking and laughing, and I knew that this was the beginning of something special.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events:</p><p></p><p>Over the next few months, our relationship blossomed. We went on adventures together, explored new places, and spent countless hours getting to know each other. We were inseparable, and I couldn't imagine my life without him.</p><p></p><p>But then, one day, everything changed. I received a job offer in another state, and I knew that I had to take it. We talked about it and decided that we would make it work, even though we would be long distance. But as the days went by, the distance between us seemed to grow. We started to drift apart, and eventually, we decided to break up.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story:</p><p></p><p>I moved away and started my new job, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. I tried to move on and focus on my career, but I couldn't help but think about what could have been. I often found myself wondering, "What if we had never met?"</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In the end, I realized that our relationship was just one of many possible paths that my life could have taken. But even though things didn't work out between us, I will always be grateful for the time we spent together. Our relationship may have been brief, but it was filled with love, laughter, and countless memories. And who knows, maybe one day our paths will cross again and we can pick up where we left off. Until then, I will always cherish the time we had together.</p><p></p><p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: The Power of Education: A What-If Scenario</p><p></p><p>Introduction: Education has always been a crucial aspect of human life. It has the power to shape our minds, broaden our horizons, and open up opportunities for us. But what if we did not have access to education? How would our lives be different? This is the question we aim to explore in this narrative essay.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story: Imagine a world where education was not considered important. Children were not encouraged to go to school, and those who did were often ridiculed for their efforts. In this world, the pursuit of knowledge was seen as a waste of time and resources.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events: As a result of this lack of emphasis on education, many people struggled to find jobs and make a decent living. They were trapped in a cycle of poverty and had little hope of breaking free. Those who did manage to secure jobs often had to settle for low-paying, unskilled positions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, without access to education, many people were unable to learn the skills needed to adapt to a rapidly changing world. As technology advanced, they were left behind, unable to compete in the job market or even keep up with the world around them.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story: Eventually, the lack of education began to take a toll on society. Crime rates increased, and people became more isolated and unhappy. The economy struggled, and the overall quality of life declined. It was clear that the absence of education had severely impacted the world in a negative way.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, education is a powerful tool that has the ability to shape our lives for the better. Without it, we would be unable to compete in a rapidly changing world and would be more likely to face poverty, isolation, and unhappiness. It is crucial that we prioritize education and provide access to it for all individuals.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Greetings, mortal.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Promoting a healthy relationship must empower the importance of respect - respect for individuality, humanity, differences, and regardless of the person's origin, beliefs, and principles. Respect should be genuinely offered more than earned because how we want to be treated must first reflect on our behavior and manners. However, this does not guarantee another person's reciprocity which is why respect must be inculcated or instilled individually.</p><p></p><p>Some people believe that respect must be demanded. A demand does not always lead to healthy relationships. Relationships built in a forced respect become toxic over time.</p><p></p><p>People should learn to appreciate the benefits of respect in building healthy relationships because as we portray and empower respect, we get to nurture our relationships and make it more lasting and purposeful.</p><br />

Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood.
