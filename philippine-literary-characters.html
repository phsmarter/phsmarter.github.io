It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars.
