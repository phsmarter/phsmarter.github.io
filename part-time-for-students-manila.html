                                            1990 Earthquake wreaks havocin the PhilippinesMore than 1,000 people are killed when a 7,7-magnitude earthquake strikesLuzon Island in the Philippines on this day in 1990. The massive tremor wreakedhavoc across a sizeable portion of Luzon, the country's largest island, with BaguioCity suffering the most devastating effects. The epicenter of the quake, which struckat 4:26 pm, was north of Manila in the Nueva Ecija province. Reports indicate thatthe shaling went on for nearly a full minute. Collapsing buildings were the maincause of damage and death. Getting out of a multi-story building was a good safetyprecaution that afternoon, although many people were injured and a few even died instampedes of others doing the same thing. At Christian College, a six-story buildingcompletely collapsed, trapping approximately 250 students and teachers insideHeroic rescue efforts saved many, but some victims who did not die in the collapsewere found dead later from dehydration because they were not pulled out in time.All types of buildings, including several resort hotels in Baguio, known asthe Philippines' Summer Capital, suffered tremendous damage. Most of the city's100,000 residents slept outdoors that evening and during the following week, afraid toreturn to their homes amid the frequent aftershocks. For days, workers pulled bodiesfrom the demolished buildings in Baguio. The best estimate is that 1,000 bodies wereeventually recovered. At least another 1,000 people suffered serious injuries. Rescueefforts were bampered severely because the three main roads into the city wentblocked by landslides. Hundreds of motorists were stranded on the roads as wellOutside of Baguio, a chemical factory fire also caused terrible damage. The Tuba goldand copper mine in the area lost 30 workers when a mine collapsed. Baguio, sitting onat least sevea fault lines, is now listed as one of the most risk prone cities in Asia. Inaddition to the risk of earthquakes, the area's high annual rainfall increases thelikelihood of deadly landslides. American military personnel stationed in thePhilippine archipelago took part in the relief effort. The area was revisited by disasterless than a year later when Mount Pinatubo erupted. Some geologists believe the twoevents were connected.http://www history.com/thin-day-in-history/earthquake-wraalahaves in the philippinesExtra advertising​</a>

                            8. 1990 Earthquake wreaks havocin the PhilippinesMore than 1,000 people are killed when a 7,7-magnitude earthquake strikesLuzon Island in the Philippines on this day in 1990. The massive tremor wreakedhavoc across a sizeable portion of Luzon, the country's largest island, with BaguioCity suffering the most devastating effects. The epicenter of the quake, which struckat 4:26 pm, was north of Manila in the Nueva Ecija province. Reports indicate thatthe shaling went on for nearly a full minute. Collapsing buildings were the maincause of damage and death. Getting out of a multi-story building was a good safetyprecaution that afternoon, although many people were injured and a few even died instampedes of others doing the same thing. At Christian College, a six-story buildingcompletely collapsed, trapping approximately 250 students and teachers insideHeroic rescue efforts saved many, but some victims who did not die in the collapsewere found dead later from dehydration because they were not pulled out in time.All types of buildings, including several resort hotels in Baguio, known asthe Philippines' Summer Capital, suffered tremendous damage. Most of the city's100,000 residents slept outdoors that evening and during the following week, afraid toreturn to their homes amid the frequent aftershocks. For days, workers pulled bodiesfrom the demolished buildings in Baguio. The best estimate is that 1,000 bodies wereeventually recovered. At least another 1,000 people suffered serious injuries. Rescueefforts were bampered severely because the three main roads into the city wentblocked by landslides. Hundreds of motorists were stranded on the roads as wellOutside of Baguio, a chemical factory fire also caused terrible damage. The Tuba goldand copper mine in the area lost 30 workers when a mine collapsed. Baguio, sitting onat least sevea fault lines, is now listed as one of the most risk prone cities in Asia. Inaddition to the risk of earthquakes, the area's high annual rainfall increases thelikelihood of deadly landslides. American military personnel stationed in thePhilippine archipelago took part in the relief effort. The area was revisited by disasterless than a year later when Mount Pinatubo erupted. Some geologists believe the twoevents were connected.http://www history.com/thin-day-in-history/earthquake-wraalahaves in the philippinesExtra advertising​</h2><br />
