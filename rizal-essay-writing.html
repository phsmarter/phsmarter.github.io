<p>
</p><p>  </p><p><strong>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</strong> He was born on June 19, 1861, some 35 years before that fateful day. The seventh of the eleven children born to a comparatively well-to-do family in the Dominican lands of Calamba, Laguna, Jose Rizal lived and died in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial era.  </p><p><strong>Jose's father, Francisco Mercado Rizal</strong>, was a prosperous farmer from Binan, Laguna, while his mother, Teodora Alonzo y Quintos, was an accomplished and highly educated woman from Sta. Cruz, Manila.
</p><p>In his early childhood, Jose had perfected the alphabet, learnt to write and read books like the Spanish translation of the Vulgate Bible. At a young age, he had always shown a tendency towards the arts. His family was fascinated by his pencil paintings, sketches, and clay moldings. Later in his youth, he displayed a special talent in painting and drawing, wrote a Tagalog play, which was presented at the Calamba Festival, and penned a short Spanish play, which was presented at the school.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>He went to Spain on 3 May 1882 and enrolled at the Universidad Central de Madrid.</strong> He obtained a degree in medicine in June 1884 at the age of 23. A year back, he finished his course of Philosophy and Letters with the rank of "excellent." Wanting to treat his mother's advanced blindness, Rizal went to Paris, Heidelberg, and Berlin to gain more experience and expertise in ophthalmology. He finished his eye specialization in Heidelberg.  </p><p>Well-traveled, he is said to have mastered 22 languages. He wrote remarkable poetry, contributed nationalist essays to magazines, maintained his diary religiously, and corresponded to his friends and relatives. In March 1887, in Berlin, he published his first controversial book, Noli Me Tangere, which exposed the injustice and greed of the Spanish clergy and officials in the Philippines. To prove that the Filipinos had an outstanding culture long before the Spanish occupation, Morga's Successos De Las Islas Filipinas was annotated and reprinted in Paris. On September 18, 1891, Rizal's more militant book, El Filibusterismo, was published in Ghent.
</p><p>In 1896, Rizal was granted permission by the governor general to become a volunteer military physician for the war in Cuba, which at the time still raged from yellow fever. But the 'Katipunan' launched the Philippine Revolution on August 26, 1896. T<strong>he influential people who were provoked by Rizal's hostility used the opportunity to include him in the revolt. He was guilty of revolt and sentenced to death by firing squad at Bagumbayan Field after a trial in the Kangaroo court (now Luneta).</strong>

                            8.  Write an essay on how important is the study of Rizal course in this time. What is impact to you as a learner? ​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><strong>The Rizal Course is in the curriculum of subjects. We studied that in our college years. But I personally, Pinoy as I am, and a questioning boy since Grade I, find this Course a surplussage. Rizal could have been a One Chapter in Pinas History. Other than the fact that Rizal’s family can afford to send him to Spain and travel to Europe and wrote two novels and lots of letters (that was the medium thence), and exile in the south of Pinas is far-away Zamboanga, there is not much. There were two novels, but too are other reformers worldwise.</strong><strong>It is important to study the life of Jose Rizal because of his input towards the independence of Philippines. He chose to fight for his country through knowledge and the power of letters. He noticed the continued suffering of his countrymen at the hands of the Spaniards and sought to put an end to this situation.</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>He who does not know how to look back at where he came from will never get to his destination.”(Jose Rizal) This quote best describes the life of this wonderful hero Jose Rizal. Born on a tiny island in the Philippines, Rizal studied under the church. Years later Rizal left to study medicine abroad, but also left for an unclear politically-related reason. He spent some of his time in Spain (which at the time occupied the Philippines with colonies) to study medicine and writing. He was a very talented writer who knew how to write in Spanish, Tagalog, German, French, English, and Italian and also knew Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. After Spain he continued traveling to see how the world treated each other. He took particular interest in the United States and how it freed itself from English rule. He wished the same would happen to save the poor and oppressed of his home land of the Philippines. He unloaded all his thoughts, feelings, and beliefs into two books that inspired the people to rise up. Jose Rizal deserves the sacred name hero because he never believed in violence to solve his problems, always helped others, and was brave beyond compare, and as a result he set an entire colony on the path of freedom.</p><p></p><br />

Incidents of injustice experienced by his own family pushed Jose Rizal to advocate for reform in the Philippines. The reforms he demanded at that time were limited to equal rights between the Spaniards and the Filipinos.</p><p> The Philippines entered as a province of Spain, not as a colony. Jose Rizal is known as a physician, ethnologist, naturalist, artist, sculptor, novelist, and poet.<strong> Jose Rizal's struggle using peaceful means as an artist against Spain.</strong> One method of opposing Spanish colonization was to write criticism in the form of novels and poetry, such as the novel Noli Me Tangere. Jose Rizal's literary arts background was inherited from his mother, who is good at writing poetry. </p><p>The Spanish government viewed him as a rebel as a result of all of his struggles, which made them extremely dangerous.

                            In 1890, Rizal, 29, left Paris for Brussels as he was preparing for the publication of his annotations of Antonio de Morga's "Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas." There, he lived in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters, Catherina and Suzanna who had a niece also named Suzanna ("Thil") HistorianGregorio F. Zaide states that Rizal had "his romance with Suzanne Jacoby, 45, the petite niece of his landladies." Belgian Pros Slachmuylders, however, believed that Rizal had a romance with the niece, Suzanna Thil, in 1890. Belgian Jean Paul Verstraeten proved this. Jean Paul traced in the archives of Brussels that in the same house as Suzanne Jacoby, a little niece was living, Suzanne Till. Letters from Suzanne to Rizal were signed by "Petite Suzanne".<br /><br />Rizal's Brussels stay was short-lived, as he moved to Madrid, leaving the young Suzanna a box of chocolates. Suzanna replied in French: "After your departure, I did not take the chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of your parting. Don’t delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my for running to the mailbox to see if there is a letter from you. There will never be any home in which you are so loved as in that in Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back…" (Oct. 1, 1890 letter). The house where Rizal was staying, in Rue Philippe de Champagne 38 doesn't exist anymore following some writers. (the house numbers jump from 36 to 42). Jean Paul Verstraeten proved during his research that this house still exists, on August 10, 1900, the number of the house was changed into 42. Jean Paul traced the owner of this house and convinced her to put a historical marker. Slachmuylders’ group in 2007 unveiled this historical marker commemorating Rizal's stay in Brussels in 1890.<br /><br />The content of Rizal's writings changed considerably in his two most famous novels, Noli Me Tángere, published in Berlin in 1887, and El Filibusterismo, published in Ghent in 1891 with funds borrowed largely from Rizal's friends. These writings angered both the Spanish colonial elite and many educated Filipinos due to their insulting symbolism. They are critical of Spanish friars and the power of the Church. Rizal's friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austria-Hungary born professor and historian wrote that the novel's characters were drawn from real life and that every episode can be repeated on any day in the Philippines<br /><br /><br /><br />SANA MAKATULONG<br />
