                            1. write your reflection essay about pre-spanish literature?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PHILIPPINE MEDIA AND LITERATURE  DURING THE PRE-SPANISH ERA
</p><p>
</p><p>The following are accounts of existence and developments of Philippine literature from the Pre-Spanish Colonization:
</p><p>
</p><p>The Start of Recorded History
</p><p>
</p><p>The end of Philippine prehistory is April 21 900 AD, the date inscribed in the oldest Philippine document found so far, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription. From the details of the document, written in Kawi script, the bearer of a debt, Namwaran, along with his children Lady Angkatan and Bukah, are cleared of a debt by the ruler of Tondo. From the various Sanskrit terms and titles seen in the document, the culture and society of Manila Bay was that of a Hindu-Old Malay amalgamation, similar to the cultures of Java, Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra at the time. There are no other significant documents from this period of pre-Hispanic Philippine society and culture until the Doctrina Christiana of the late 16th century, written at the start of the Spanish period in both native Baybayin script and Spanish. Other artifacts with Kawi script and baybayin were found, such as an Ivory seal from Butuan dated to the early 11th century and the Calatagan pot with baybayin inscription, dated to the 13th century.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the years leading up to 1000 CE, there were already several maritime societies existing in the islands but there was no unifying political state encompassing the entire Philippine archipelago. Instead, the region was dotted by numerous semi-autonomous barangays (settlements ranging in size from villages to city-states) under the sovereignty of competing thalassocracies ruled by datus, rajahs or sultans or by upland agricultural societies ruled by “petty plutocrats”. States such as the Kingdom of Maynila, the Kingdom of Taytay in Palawan (mentioned by Pigafetta to be where they resupllied when the remaining ships escaped Cebu after Magellan was slain), the Chieftaincy of Coron Island ruled by fierce warriors called Tagbanua as reported by Spanish missionaries mentioned by Nilo S. Ocampo, Namayan, the Dynasty of Tondo, the Confederation of Madyaas, the rajahnates of Butuan and Cebu and the sultanates of Maguindanao and Sulu existed alongside the highland societies of the Ifugao and Mangyan. Some of these regions were part of the Malayan empires of Srivijaya, Majapahit and Brunei.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Kingdom of Tondo
</p><p>
</p><p>Since at least the year 900, the thalassocracy centered in Manila Bay flourished via an active trade with Chinese, Japanese, Malays, and various other peoples in East Asia. Tondo thrived as the capital and the seat of power of this ancient kingdom, which was led by kings under the title “Lakan” and ruled a large part of what is now known as Luzon from or possibly before 900 AD to 1571. During its existence, it grew to become one of the most prominent and wealthy kingdom states in pre-colonial Philippines due to heavy trade and connections with several neighboring nations such as China and Japan. In 900 AD, the lord-minister Jayadewa presented a document of debt forgiveness to Lady Angkatan and her brother Bukah, the children of Namwaran. This is described in the Philippine’s oldest known document, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription.
</p><p>
</p><p>Other facts:
</p><p>
</p><p> An Indigenous form of communication was already in existence evidenced by writings on barks and bamboos. News were also announced by an umalokohan or the town crier.
</p><p> Literature was already developing: forms included sabi, (maxim), bugtong (riddle), darangan (epic poetry), kumintang (war songs), and hudhud (wedding song).
</p><p>Historical Background
</p><p>
</p><p>Long time before the Spaniards and other foreigners landed on Philippine shores, our forefathers already had their own literature stamped in the history of our race. Our ancient literature shows our customs and traditions in everyday life as traced in our folk stories, old plays and short stories. Our ancient ancestors also had their own alphabet which was different from that brought by the Spaniards. The first alphabet used by our ancestors was similar to that of the Malayo-Polynesian alphabet. Whatever records our ancestors left were either burned by the Spaniards friars in the belief that they were works of the devil or were written on materials that easily perished, like the barks of trees, dried leaves and bamboo cylinders which could not have remained undestroyed even if efforts were made to preserve them. Other records that remained showed folk songs that proved the existence of a native culture truly our own. Some of these were passed on byword of mouth till they reached the hands of some publishers or printers who took interest in printing the manuscripts of the ancient Filipinos. The Spaniards who came to the Philippines tried to prove that our ancestors were really fond of poetry, songs, stories, riddles and proverbs which we still enjoy today and which serve to show to generations the true culture of our people.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a lover of literature, I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that "literature adds reality." Literature has the unique ability to transport readers to different worlds, times, and experiences, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the complexities and nuances of human life.</p><p></p><p>But literature does more than just provide a temporary escape from reality. It also helps us to better understand and navigate the reality we live in. Through literature, we encounter diverse perspectives and ideas that broaden our understanding of the world and the people around us. We learn about different cultures, histories, and ways of life that we may not have been exposed to otherwise.</p><p></p><p>In this way, literature enriches the competencies that daily life requires. It helps us to develop empathy, critical thinking, and communication skills, as well as a greater awareness and understanding of the world. These are all essential skills that we rely on in our personal and professional lives.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, literature has the power to bring beauty and meaning to our lives, especially in times when life may feel mundane or monotonous. It can provide solace and comfort during difficult times, and offer new ways of looking at the world that can inspire and uplift us. In this sense, literature can "inigate the deserts" of our lives, bringing new life and vitality to our daily experiences.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, literature adds reality in a multitude of ways. It expands our understanding of the world and the people around us, enriches the competencies we need to navigate daily life, and brings beauty and meaning to our lives. Whether we are lost in a captivating novel or studying a classic work of literature, the power of literature to enrich and deepen our reality is undeniable.</p><p></p><p><strong> If you have any other questions,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>just </strong><strong>let </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>know</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>narin </strong><strong>ty</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />
