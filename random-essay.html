Drug testing can be performedfrom small samples taken of your fingernails, saliva, or more commonly, your blood, urine, or hair. Almost 10 percent of the nation’s teens report the use of illicit drugs within the lastmonth. The drug testing in high school and college students is an important and ultimatelyone of the best solution made by the government officials to reduce and stop theincreasing amount of young drug users in schools, universities, and state colleges.Schools have made the policy of random drug testing on students to serves as a warningto not get into peer pressure. Because I believe “a friend in deed, won’t make you smokethat weed.” Drug testing in school has resulted in accurate, powerful, and a positive outcomein attempting to reduce the amount of young drug users in school. The purpose of drugtesting is not to catch whose using an illegal drug, but to prevent them from using it inthe first place. Surely, there should be action taken to punish those criminals. The currentmethod to attack drugs is at the source, by imprisoning dealers and breaking the supplychain are not so succeeding. Why drug testing is so important and necessary to be implemented, because it is important to protect teenagers at the age were, they’re easily get influenced by the peers and at the time when their attitude to education greatly affectstheir entire lives.Some sacrifice of human rights is necessary to eliminate the drug problem. Drugtesting is a simple mechanism for examining the human body because there is a multipleoptions of detecting it by supplying urine, hair, or simply a breath. These small samplehelps to detect the common drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Also, if you know that you are not breaking the law then there’s nothing to fear of.

1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nothing is permanent </p><p></p><p>Nothing is permanent, only change. This means that life is a matter of change, and nothing can stay the same forever. Looking forward to and even expecting change will bring stability in life. Appreciate the change as if it were a sacred plan. Just to think that if something remained the same, we couldn't achieve all of the lessons of life. I think the change will happen as part of a plan that is moving before time begins. We believe that every change is a test and a catapult that moves us to the next level of our being. I believe that "nothing lasts forever and everything will change."</p><br />

Underline the reasons/ evidences that support the claim A Position Paper of Drug Testing of High Schooland College Students Drug testing is a way to evaluate the type and the possibly the amount of legal andespecially for illegal drugs substances taken by a person. Drug testing can be performedfrom small samples taken of your fingernails, saliva, or more commonly, your blood, urine, or hair. Almost 10 percent of the nation’s teens report the use of illicit drugs within the lastmonth. The drug testing in high school and college students is an important and ultimatelyone of the best solution made by the government officials to reduce and stop theincreasing amount of young drug users in schools, universities, and state colleges.Schools have made the policy of random drug testing on students to serves as a warningto not get into peer pressure. Because I believe “a friend in deed, won’t make you smokethat weed.” Drug testing in school has resulted in accurate, powerful, and a positive outcomein attempting to reduce the amount of young drug users in school. The purpose of drugtesting is not to catch whose using an illegal drug, but to prevent them from using it inthe first place. Surely, there should be action taken to punish those criminals. The currentmethod to attack drugs is at the source, by imprisoning dealers and breaking the supplychain are not so succeeding. Why drug testing is so important and necessary to be implemented, because it is important to protect teenagers at the age were, they’re easily get influenced by the peers and at the time when their attitude to education greatly affectstheir entire lives.Some sacrifice of human rights is necessary to eliminate the drug problem. Drugtesting is a simple mechanism for examining the human body because there is a multipleoptions of detecting it by supplying urine, hair, or simply a breath. These small samplehelps to detect the common drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Also, if you know that you are not breaking the law then there’s nothing to fear of.

                            16. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />

                        <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. There are skills that are needed to be able to play basketball, the most important and focused one is (my opinion) is to have accuracy in shooting the ball in the hoop. In basketball, a foul refers to illegal personal contact or unsportsmanlike conduct on the court or sidelines of a game. ...

It can be done by being polite to them, offering them emotional support, helping them financially, boosting their morale or by simply being supportive to them. Kind words and kind deeds done by us are not only a boon for the recipient but are also a blessing to us. When we help others with their tasks, are polite to them and do other such acts of kindness it gives us a sense of accomplishment and joy.</p><p></p><p>Kindness has been described differently in different religious books and literature in the past. However, they all echo the same thought. All of them advocate that human beings must show kindness to other human beings as well as other creatures. We must be polite, friendly and helpful. While we should exhibit kindness we must not do it with the aim of getting anything in return. Kindness is a selfless act.</p><p></p><p>If God has been kind enough to give us the things we need we must be kind to others and render help in whatever way we can.
