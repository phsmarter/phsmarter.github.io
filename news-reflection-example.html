                                            Early this year, news of anti-Asian hate crimes surfaced. And Filipinos are far from being safe. One of the victims is Filipino-American Vilma Kari, 65, who was knocked to the ground and kicked several times as she was on her way to church. Another victim is Filipino-American Noel Quintana, 61, who was slashed across the face with a box cutter on the subway. These are only two of the many anti-Asian hate crimes being reported in the US, not to mention the unreported cases. And every day, the number increases. The spike is believed to be caused by former US President Donald Trump's coronavirus remark as "China virus." 1. What is the text about? 2. How is bias reflected in the text? 3.

                            10. Early this year, news of anti-Asian hate crimes surfaced. And Filipinos are far from being safe. One of the victims is Filipino-American Vilma Kari, 65, who was knocked to the ground and kicked several times as she was on her way to church. Another victim is Filipino-American Noel Quintana, 61, who was slashed across the face with a box cutter on the subway. These are only two of the many anti-Asian hate crimes being reported in the US, not to mention the unreported cases. And every day, the number increases. The spike is believed to be caused by former US President Donald Trump's coronavirus remark as "China virus." 1. What is the text about? 2. How is bias reflected in the text? 3. What other examples of social issues related to bias and prejudice are seen in texts today?​</h2><br />
                        The text is about the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes in the US, particularly the cases of Vilma Kari and Noel Quintana, which are examples of violent attacks on Filipino-Americans. The text also highlights the possible connection between the spike in hate crimes and former US President Donald Trump's use of the term "China virus" in reference to the coronavirus.Bias is reflected in the text through the use of language and the focus on specific examples of anti-Asian hate crimes involving Filipino-Americans. The text also suggests that the spike in hate crimes can be attributed to Donald Trump's rhetoric, which implies a bias against Asian people.Other examples of social issues related to bias and prejudice that are seen in texts today include racial profiling and police brutality against people of color, and the mistreatment of immigrants and refugees. These issues are often interconnected and can have serious negative effects on individuals and communities. It is important to address bias and prejudice in all its forms and work towards creating a more just and equitable society.<br />
