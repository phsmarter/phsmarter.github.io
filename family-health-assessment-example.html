                                            Step 1
Be specific about the decision to be made.
Step 2
Check your options.
Process Example
Identify a list of situations where a
decision needs to be made.
• Decisions are made based on a
variety of factors, experience,
knowledge, and emotions.
• Some decisions need to be made
before the situation. For example,
Washing your hands with soap and
water before eating.
• Important decisions should be made
thoughtfully.
I am invited to a birthday party of my
bestfriend in the middle of this
pandemic. I asked permission from my
parents but they won’t allow me to go.
What should I do?
I don’t want to hurt my bestfriend for not
attending her birthday party.
I also don’t want to disobey my parents
because, at my age, I am not allowed to
go out of our house during this
pandemic.
So, I will call my bestfriend and tell her
honestly my decision of not going to her
birthday party ahead of time.
Process Example
Make a list of all of the possible options
to consider in a situation.
The following questions may help you
guide your thinking:
• Is the option healthy or unhealthy?
• How does this option affect me?
• How does this option affect others?
My options are to:
1. I could ask my best friend to talk to
my parents about her birthday party.
Outcomes, positive, I get to understand
that by going out of the house during
this pandemic, I may be able to affect
the health of my family as well as mine.
2. I can still attend her birthday party
through virtual presence.
3. My family and I are safe at home.
9
Step 3
Assess your capacity to decide.
Step 4
Make a decision and follow through.
Step 5
Describe the outcome of the decision.
Process Example
After identifying options and outcomes,
distinguish between the decisions you
can make by yourself and the decisions
with which you need help.
Consider the following questions:
• Are you having trouble coming
up with healthy options?
• Is your safety or someone else’s
safety at risk?
• Are you feeling uncomfortable
with your options?
Based on the answer to these
questions, do you need to ask a trusted
adult or refer to another resource for
help?
•I feel safe and secure with this
decision.
•I can also feel comfortable with the
healthy options that I have my family
with me at home and safe.
•I can say that I made this decision on
my own.
Process Example
You are now ready to make a decision
based on your analysis of the positive
and negative outcomes.
I chose the option that is best and
healthy both for my family and my
bestfriend during this pandemic.
Process Example
Describe the outcome of the decision
and determine if the outcome was
positive or negative for others and
yourself.
I told my parents about my decision of
telling my best friend that I am not
allowed to attend her birthday party for
now because of the pandemic.
The outcome was positive
because my parents saw my courage to
tell me best-friend about my health
option for my family and my best friend
too.

                                            Heads of state and global health leaders today made an unprecedented commitment to work together to accelerate the development and production of new vaccines, tests and treatments for COVID-19 and assure equitable access worldwide.The COVID-19 pandemic has already affected more than 2.4 million people, killing over 160,000. It is taking a huge toll on families, societies, health systems and economies around the world, and for as long as this virus threatens any country, the entire world is at risk. There is an urgent need, therefore, while following existing measures to keep people physically distanced and to test and track all contacts of people who test positive, for innovative COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.“We will only halt COVID-19 through solidarity,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Countries, health partners, manufacturers, and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of science and research can benefit everybody.”Work has already started. Since January, WHO has been working with researchers from hundreds of institutions to develop and test vaccines, standardize assays and standardize regulatory approaches on innovative trial designs and define criteria to prioritize vaccine candidates.  The Organization has prequalified diagnostics that are being used all over the world, and more are in the pipeline. And it is coordinating a global trial to assess the safety and efficacy of four therapeutics against COVID-19.The challenge is to speed up and harmonize processes to ensure that once products are deemed safe and effective, they can be brought to the billions of people in the world who need them. Past experience, in the early days of HIV treatment, for example, and in the deployment of vaccines against the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, shows that even when tools are available, they have not been equally available to all.So today leaders came together at a virtual event, co-hosted by the World Health Organization, the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The event was joined by the UN Secretary General, the AU Commission Chairperson, the G20 President, heads of state of France, South Africa, Germany, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Italy, Rwanda, Norway, Spain, Malaysia and the UK (represented by the First Secretary of State).Health leaders from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), GAVI-the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund, UNITAID, the Wellcome Trust, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC), the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA), the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers’ Network (DCVMN), and the International Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (IGBA) committed to come together, guided by a common vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of COVID-19, to launch this groundbreaking collaboration. They are joined by two Special Envoys:  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Gavi Board Chair and Sir Andrew Witty, former CEO of GlaxoSmithKline.They pledged to work towards equitable global access based on an unprecedented level of partnership. They agreed to create a strong unified voice, to build on past experience and to be accountable to the world, to communities and to one another.“Our shared commitment is to ensure all people have access to all the tools to prevent, detect, treat and defeat COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros. “No country and no organization can do this alone. The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator brings together the combined power of several organizations to work with speed and scale.”Health leaders called on the global community and political leaders to support this landmark collaboration and for donors to provide the necessary resources to accelerate achievement of its objectives, capitalizing on the opportunity provided by a forthcoming pledging initiative that starts on 4 May 2020. This initiative, spearheaded by the European Union, aims to mobilize the significant resources needed to accelerate the work towards protecting the world from COVID-19when was it published?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Several decades of research have identified the contributions of psychosocial influences on adolescent and young adult sexual behavior; however, few studies have examined parental and peer influence and sexual values during the transition from high school to college. The current study tested the influence of sexual values and perceived awareness and caring (PAC), or beliefs about how much parents and peers know and care about students’ behavior, on sexual behavior during this transitional period. Using data from a longitudinal study, generalized estimating equations and the generalized linear model were used to examine the associations among sexual values, parental and peer PAC, and sexual behavior, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Participants (N = 1,847; 61% female) completed web-based surveys the summer before college matriculation and at the end of the first semester in college. Results indicated that individuals with high levels of both parental and peer PAC engaged in less frequent sexual behaviors and that PAC moderated the effect of sexual values on sexual behaviors. Furthermore, both PAC variables decreased during the transition from high school to college, and high school sexual values, parental PAC, and their interaction predicted the number of sexual partners during the first semester of college. Only sexual values and high school unsafe sexual behaviors predicted unsafe sexual behavior in college. Findings suggest that complex associations exist among perceived awareness and caring, sexual values, and sexual behaviors, and that the transition from high school to college may be an ideal time for safer-sex interventions.</p><br />

                            7. Step 1
Be specific about the decision to be made.
Step 2
Check your options.
Process Example
Identify a list of situations where a
decision needs to be made.
• Decisions are made based on a
variety of factors, experience,
knowledge, and emotions.
• Some decisions need to be made
before the situation. For example,
Washing your hands with soap and
water before eating.
• Important decisions should be made
thoughtfully.
I am invited to a birthday party of my
bestfriend in the middle of this
pandemic. I asked permission from my
parents but they won’t allow me to go.
What should I do?
I don’t want to hurt my bestfriend for not
attending her birthday party.
I also don’t want to disobey my parents
because, at my age, I am not allowed to
go out of our house during this
pandemic.
So, I will call my bestfriend and tell her
honestly my decision of not going to her
birthday party ahead of time.
Process Example
Make a list of all of the possible options
to consider in a situation.
The following questions may help you
guide your thinking:
• Is the option healthy or unhealthy?
• How does this option affect me?
• How does this option affect others?
My options are to:
1. I could ask my best friend to talk to
my parents about her birthday party.
Outcomes, positive, I get to understand
that by going out of the house during
this pandemic, I may be able to affect
the health of my family as well as mine.
2. I can still attend her birthday party
through virtual presence.
3. My family and I are safe at home.
9
Step 3
Assess your capacity to decide.
Step 4
Make a decision and follow through.
Step 5
Describe the outcome of the decision.
Process Example
After identifying options and outcomes,
distinguish between the decisions you
can make by yourself and the decisions
with which you need help.
Consider the following questions:
• Are you having trouble coming
up with healthy options?
• Is your safety or someone else’s
safety at risk?
• Are you feeling uncomfortable
with your options?
Based on the answer to these
questions, do you need to ask a trusted
adult or refer to another resource for
help?
•I feel safe and secure with this
decision.
•I can also feel comfortable with the
healthy options that I have my family
with me at home and safe.
•I can say that I made this decision on
my own.
Process Example
You are now ready to make a decision
based on your analysis of the positive
and negative outcomes.
I chose the option that is best and
healthy both for my family and my
bestfriend during this pandemic.
Process Example
Describe the outcome of the decision
and determine if the outcome was
positive or negative for others and
yourself.
I told my parents about my decision of
telling my best friend that I am not
allowed to attend her birthday party for
now because of the pandemic.
The outcome was positive
because my parents saw my courage to
tell me best-friend about my health
option for my family and my best friend
too.

                            13. Heads of state and global health leaders today made an unprecedented commitment to work together to accelerate the development and production of new vaccines, tests and treatments for COVID-19 and assure equitable access worldwide.The COVID-19 pandemic has already affected more than 2.4 million people, killing over 160,000. It is taking a huge toll on families, societies, health systems and economies around the world, and for as long as this virus threatens any country, the entire world is at risk. There is an urgent need, therefore, while following existing measures to keep people physically distanced and to test and track all contacts of people who test positive, for innovative COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.“We will only halt COVID-19 through solidarity,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Countries, health partners, manufacturers, and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of science and research can benefit everybody.”Work has already started. Since January, WHO has been working with researchers from hundreds of institutions to develop and test vaccines, standardize assays and standardize regulatory approaches on innovative trial designs and define criteria to prioritize vaccine candidates.  The Organization has prequalified diagnostics that are being used all over the world, and more are in the pipeline. And it is coordinating a global trial to assess the safety and efficacy of four therapeutics against COVID-19.The challenge is to speed up and harmonize processes to ensure that once products are deemed safe and effective, they can be brought to the billions of people in the world who need them. Past experience, in the early days of HIV treatment, for example, and in the deployment of vaccines against the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, shows that even when tools are available, they have not been equally available to all.So today leaders came together at a virtual event, co-hosted by the World Health Organization, the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The event was joined by the UN Secretary General, the AU Commission Chairperson, the G20 President, heads of state of France, South Africa, Germany, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Italy, Rwanda, Norway, Spain, Malaysia and the UK (represented by the First Secretary of State).Health leaders from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), GAVI-the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund, UNITAID, the Wellcome Trust, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC), the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA), the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers’ Network (DCVMN), and the International Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (IGBA) committed to come together, guided by a common vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of COVID-19, to launch this groundbreaking collaboration. They are joined by two Special Envoys:  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Gavi Board Chair and Sir Andrew Witty, former CEO of GlaxoSmithKline.They pledged to work towards equitable global access based on an unprecedented level of partnership. They agreed to create a strong unified voice, to build on past experience and to be accountable to the world, to communities and to one another.“Our shared commitment is to ensure all people have access to all the tools to prevent, detect, treat and defeat COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros. “No country and no organization can do this alone. The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator brings together the combined power of several organizations to work with speed and scale.”Health leaders called on the global community and political leaders to support this landmark collaboration and for donors to provide the necessary resources to accelerate achievement of its objectives, capitalizing on the opportunity provided by a forthcoming pledging initiative that starts on 4 May 2020. This initiative, spearheaded by the European Union, aims to mobilize the significant resources needed to accelerate the work towards protecting the world from COVID-19when was it published?​</h2><br />
