Thirty-five schools (95%) are reported to have formed disaster committees. 6) of the respondent However, less than one-third (30%) of schools have disaster preparedness plans. 3. identify areas of controversy in the literature 4. formulate questions that need further research (http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/specific-types-of-good. Another study by Kano et al. (2007) in Los Angeles includes three public school districts conducted through self-administered questionnaires on emergency preparedness. The result reveals that most respondents feel safe in their schools towards disasters. However, the survey reveals a need to improve the schools' written disaster plans, training on how to respond during emergencies, procurement of equipment and supplies to be used during emergencies, and the practice of a Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS). The study by Ozmen (2006) in Turkey on the aspects of the principals of the schools regarding the school's level of preparedness reveals that the schools are not ready since their level of preparedness is not This means that the school principals do not attain the high level of preparedness for an earthquake.

Learning Task 4: Read the sample abstract of a completed quantitative research. Identify
the variables of the study and construct a conceptual framework.
Research Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
Example of a Research 
Hypothesis
Question: Is there a significant 
relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>TYPES OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</p><p>COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MODELS</p><p>The following community engagement models are supported by the Office of Community Engagement through community-engaged learning courses, student employment, or volunteer opportunities for groups or individuals.</p><p></p><p>Community Building</p><p>Projects that intentionally bring people together to simply get to know one another. Examples include the Morris Community Meal.</p><p></p><p>Community Education</p><p>Projects that provide instructional services or curricula, or serve to educate the public about a social issue (in a non-partisan way). Examples include the TREC program, Community ESL classes, and Gather in the Park.</p><p></p><p>Community Organizing</p><p>Projects that bring people together with the goal of solving a community issue. Please note that OCE cannot work on partisan issues, but can contribute to creating solutions for non-partisan, local issues. An example is assistance in establishing the Latino Parent Advisory Board for the local school.</p><p></p><p>Deliberative Dialogue</p><p>Projects that intentionally bring people together to build understanding across differences.</p><p></p><p>Direct Service</p><p>Projects that provide a service or product to an individual, group, or the community as a whole. Examples include filling a volunteer shift at a local organization, creating social media tools for an organization, or creating a community mural.</p><p></p><p>Economic Development</p><p>Projects that work on developing the regional economy in a sustainable way. Note that OCE does not partner with for-profit entities except when doing so would benefit the community as a whole and not the for-profit only organization. Examples include feasibility studies for new businesses and projects that attract people to small town business disricts.</p><p></p><p>Engaged Research</p><p>Research that directly benefits the community by clarifying the causes of a community challenge, mapping a community's assets, or contributing to solutions to current challenges and also fits a faculty member's research agenda. In the best case scenario, faculty with research expertise work alongside community members and students on such projects. An example would be the MIEI community needing assessment.</p><p></p><p>Institutional Engagement</p><p>University resources intentionally offered without undue barriers to the community. OCE can play a role in envisioning institutional engagement efforts. Examples include making Briggs library cards available for community members, making campus events accessible, and choosing to use local and sustainable businesses to supply services or goods.</p><p></p><p>Give 1 Example of Community Engagement and atleast 3 objectives</p><br />

How to write a literature review: . • . 1. Enumerate 2. Describe 3. Summarize objectively 4. Evaluate 5. Clarify the previous research. It should give a theoretical base for the research and help you (the author) determine the nature of your research. The literature review acknowledges the work of previous researchers and, in so doing, assures the reader that your work has been well conceived. A literature review must do these things: 1. be organized around and related directly to the thesis or research question you are developing 2. synthesize results into a summary of what is and is not known writing/literature-review) (https://guides.library.bloomu.edu/litreview) Read a portion of a literature review below: According to the study of Guevarra et al. (2007) on the Assessment of Disaster Preparedness in selected public schools in Luzon, of the 37 schools covered in the study, most (59%) of them came from the national capital region, and most of them are elementary schools. Thirty-five schools (95%) are reported to have formed disaster committees. 6) of the respondent However, less than one-third (30%) of schools have disaster preparedness plans. 3. identify areas of controversy in the literature 4. formulate questions that need further research (http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/specific-types-of-good. Another study by Kano et al. (2007) in Los Angeles includes three public school districts conducted through self-administered questionnaires on emergency preparedness. The result reveals that most respondents feel safe in their schools towards disasters. However, the survey reveals a need to improve the schools' written disaster plans, training on how to respond during emergencies, procurement of equipment and supplies to be used during emergencies, and the practice of a Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS). The study by Ozmen (2006) in Turkey on the aspects of the principals of the schools regarding the school's level of preparedness reveals that the schools are not ready since their level of preparedness is not This means that the school principals do not attain the high level of preparedness for an earthquake.

Therapy is always there but I've never really seen it as an option probably because I live in the Philippines. However, I meet more and more people who have chosen to get help and so far, there are mixed opinions. The Philippines already has the Mental Health Act approved by the two houses of the senate which hopefully will be passed into law this year (2018).

A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
