Better even than listening to an audiobook or reading one on an e-reader. It reduces stress, promotes comprehension and imagination, alleviates depression, helps you sleep, and may contribute to preventing Alzheimer's. Reading is active; watching TV is passive. Books can also increase your knowledge in studying it can help your brain solve any problems like for example, you are reading about The Solar System, then the next that was your next lesson, and now you can answer all questions from your teacher about the said lesson.</p><p></p><p>Thank you!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Books have been a valuable source of knowledge, entertainment, and inspiration for centuries. They are considered to be one of the most influential mediums in shaping our culture and society. However, in the modern era of technology, television has become a popular alternative to books for many individuals. Despite this, I firmly believe that books are still better than television. In this essay, I will provide three reasons why I hold this opinion, backed up by evidence, and conclude with my final thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>1. Books stimulate the imagination better than television.</p><p>Books offer a unique experience of being able to visualize stories and characters in our own mind. This imaginative process is not limited by the visual images presented by a television screen, but rather fueled by the language used in books. According to a study conducted by the University of Liverpool, readers of fiction develop a better ability to empathize with others, and they are more creative and open-minded. This is because they engage in a more active process of imagining the story's events and characters in their minds.</p><p></p><p>2. Books allow for deeper learning than television.</p><p>Books offer a greater depth of knowledge on any given subject compared to television programs. The written word provides a more detailed analysis of a topic, allowing readers to gain a deeper understanding. For instance, in the case of history, books provide more information and a better analysis of events, personalities, and cultures than a television program. According to research, people retain less information while watching television because it is a passive activity that does not require critical thinking and active engagement.</p><p></p><p>3. Books provide a break from technology.</p><p>In today's digital age, we spend much of our time glued to screens, which can have negative impacts on our mental and physical health. Books offer a break from this technology and allow us to relax, unwind, and escape from the world. Additionally, reading books before bed can help with insomnia and promote better sleep, unlike the blue light emitted by screens.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, books offer a better experience than television because they stimulate the imagination, allow for deeper learning, and provide a break from technology. Although television is a useful tool, it cannot compare to the benefits of reading books. As the famous author Stephen King once said, "Books are uniquely portable magic," and I couldn't agree more.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Send a message.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Digital technology makes children's lives better.</strong></p><p>Digital technology has had a profound impact on children's lives by providing them with access to a wealth of educational, recreational, and communication opportunities. It has enabled them to explore and discover new things, while also giving them a platform to express themselves and connect with others. From online learning resources to interactive games, digital technology has made it easier than ever for children to learn, create, and engage with the world around them. In short, digital technology has made children's lives better by providing them with the tools to stay educated and connected in a quickly changing world.</p><p></p><p><strong>Books are better than television.</strong></p><p>Books are far superior to television when it comes to providing educational and entertainment value. Not only do books offer the opportunity to engage with complex storylines and characters, but they also allow the reader to challenge their critical thinking skills and expand their knowledge base. In contrast, television simply offers passive entertainment with minimal educational or thought-provoking content. Therefore, books are undeniably the better choice for readers seeking to truly engage with the stories they consume.</p><p></p><p><strong>School uniforms should be abolished.</strong></p><p>School uniforms should be abolished because they limit students' individual expression, create an unnecessary financial burden on families, and do not influence academic performance. Requiring students to wear uniforms goes against the very core of our educational system, which is to nurture independent thought and creativity. Furthermore, the cost of the uniforms can be a significant financial burden on lower-income families, who may be forced to make difficult choices between buying uniforms and other basic necessities. Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that requiring uniforms in schools leads to any improvement in academic performance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Homework should be banned.</strong></p><p>Homework should be banned because it takes away valuable time from students to pursue their interests, practice sports, and spend time with family. Furthermore, research has shown that homework does not necessarily lead to improved academic performance, and it can cause unnecessary stress and anxiety in students. Therefore, it is in the best interest of students to eliminate homework altogether.</p><p></p><p><strong>We should all be vegetarian.</strong></p><p>We should all be vegetarian because it is a more sustainable and healthier dietary choice than eating meat. Not only does it reduce the environmental impact of animal agriculture, but it also reduces the risk of certain diseases and helps to limit the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, plant-based diets are low in saturated fat and cholesterol, making them an excellent choice for those looking to improve their overall health.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Books are better than television it's because if you are using books, you are the one you analyze it, you are the one who is explaining it to yourself as well compared in just watching television, this can also affects your eye sight or your vision so books are better because you create your own imagination on it</p><br />

                        <p>School Uniforms Should be Mandatory:</p><p>DISAGREE. While school uniforms can have benefits such as promoting a sense of unity and reducing peer pressure based on clothing, I believe that mandating school uniforms takes away individual expression and creativity. Students should have the right to express themselves through their clothing, and mandating school uniforms can be a financial burden on families who cannot afford them.</p><p></p><p>Social Media brings more harm Than good:</p><p>NEITHER AGREE NOR DISAGREE. Social media can have both positive and negative impacts, depending on how it is used. While it can be a valuable tool for communication, information-sharing, and community-building, it can also contribute to cyberbullying, addiction, and the spread of misinformation. It is important to be mindful of the way we use social media and to prioritize responsible and ethical online behavior.</p><p></p><p>Books provide better entertainment than television:</p><p>DISAGREE. Both books and television can provide valuable entertainment and educational content, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference. While books can provide a more immersive and imaginative experience, television can offer a visual and auditory experience that can be equally engaging.
