                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Twenty years ago, education was based on books and lectures, now, it's iPads and websites. In the past, students would have to spend hours in libraries looking through books for a project or research. ... One major difference that has changed through the curriculum in schools is teaching students skills instead of content</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Education in the Philippines is offered through formal and non-formal systems. Formal education typically spans 14 years and is structured in a 6+4+4 system: 6 years of primary school education, 4 years of secondary school education, and 4 years of higher education, leading to a bachelor's degree.</p><p></p><br />

                            11. Write your own opinion about the educated Filipino in the past and the present</h2><br />
                        <p>My own opinion about <strong>the educated Filipino in the past and the present:</strong></p><p></p><p>After the Philippines became independent and became a country, education <strong>continued</strong>, continuing the educational institutions that had been initiated by the colonial period. The nation's children continue to stretch in search of knowledge, they begin to absorb <strong>various</strong> <strong>knowledge</strong> from various countries and educational institutions.</p><p></p><p>Then<strong> re-examined</strong>, trying to find the root of the problem. So the meeting point is considered to lie in the lack of educational facilities and systems that are run. For a way out, try to repair the means. All educational needs related to facilities and infrastructure were again addressed.</p><p></p><p>However, a new problem arose, the managers of the facilities and infrastructure sector took actions that were both embarrassing and heartbreaking. The behavior of our nation is far from the moral guidance of the Prophet. <strong>Corruption</strong> is rampant, the <strong>managers</strong> of state finances, <strong>officials</strong> who carry out repairs do such despicable things. As a result, changes towards improving the education sector remain an obstacle.</p><p></p><p>Then who else is to blame? Is it really the inappropriate curriculum, or inadequate facilities and infrastructure? Or maybe the human resources are incompetent?</p><p></p><p>I temporary assumption indicates that the main cause of our education, including the future, lies in human awareness. Especially the bearer of the task of education itself. Both from the government sector which is not really serious about management, especially from the people who do not raise the main concern for the progress of this education sector. Especially <strong>public awareness</strong> of obedience to applicable rules, especially for the advancement of education.</p><p></p><p>If people's awareness of the importance of education is truly ingrained, and if the government as the controller is really serious about improving it, then rest assured that future progress can be achieved. Then how to grow awareness in this society? The main key also lies in the example of the <strong>authorities</strong>. If the authorities set an example for the people, then they will also behave in accordance with the demands and demands.</p><p></p><p>However, our nation is not yet <strong>aware</strong>, not yet obeying <strong>principles</strong> and <strong>obeying</strong> rules. Everyone wants to win alone, everyone wants to advance on their own, the principle of togetherness begins to fade. When you fall into a deep abyss, just look for a scapegoat to blame. There aren't many people who are willing to sacrifice for the world of education, you can count people who care about street children, not to mention the increasing number of unemployed people. All of the above <strong>circumstances</strong> and phenomena will be an indication of how our education portrait will be in the <strong>future</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> whether a person can be educated without a formal education:<br /></strong>https://brainly.ph/question/20526770</p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><p></p><br />

                            17. Why it is important for us to recall the past education of the Philippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Besides the oft-quoted need for Filipinos to never forget the lessons of history and that it’s a duty and service to the country, I’d like to cite three other reasons:</p><p></p><p>Studying history allows us to gain valuable perspectives on the problems of our modern society. Many problems, features, and characteristics of modern Philippine society can be traced back to historical questions on our colonial past, as well as our pre-colonial culture. Our export-oriented economy, for example, can be traced back to the ending of the galleon trade and the subsequent liberalization and tying of the country to the world market, coupled with the lack of industrial advancement in the islands. This and other lessons can be uncovered by digging deep into the country’s past.</p><p></p><p>This also applies to other countries’ histories, and while studying the past may not actually present a solution to current problems or directly answer questions, they lend new and alternative perspectives to current situations and allow us to further understand current problems.</p><p></p><p>History as a discipline allows us to see beyond textbooks and see the past through new lenses. There were times in the Spanish colonial period where the clergy and religious orders assigned to the country were the ones causing misery to the Filipinos, while there are times when the Church truly cared for the natives and the government was the one doing the people harm. This is an interesting part of our history that sadly reaches the textbooks in a boring, oversimplified version that says all the Spanish were bad. If we cling to what the textbooks tell us then we will already have a wrong understanding of Philippine history. The study of history allows us to see beyond the standard textbook and to the primary source itself, interpreted into new and alternative viewpoints.</p><p></p><p>Philippine history is in and of itself very interesting. Philippine history is a unique narrative of colonialism, reaction, and revolution. It is also a culturally diverse country from precolonial times. There’s an emerging trend to study the social history of the country (i.e. more on the day-to-day experience of the Filipinos during certain periods) and uncover more stories beyond the usual stories taught in schools across the country. The country’s experience of colonialism, the rise of nationalistic feelings, and the people’s subsequent reaction may allow us to gain more perspectives on nationalism and revolutions.</p><br />

</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>We credit some Filipino lifestyle to them, most especially to Americans who taught us to be wise and introduce some basic learning ideas. During the Pre-Colonial Era, the educators were the Babaylan and Katalonan who both looked upon the society possessing wisdom and knowledge on spiritual practice. The type of education that was taught to the people was based on beliefs and spiritual practice. When Spaniards came, it was the most tragic century ever recorded in Philippine History.

</strong></p><p><strong>Although during their time, they implemented a systematic and institutionalized kind of education. We suffered great grievances from them. After three hundred and thirty-three years, here comes the Americans and saved us from the hand of Spaniards by treaty of Paris.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>At this present, the Philippines education has developed over the years. The change and development of education now is base on the country’s administration and also through the help of advanced technology. The Philippines under this administration focus on expanding the provision of basic education. The Department of Education or DepEd and the private sector help each other to provide a wide range of education. Before you will notice how education is different from now.
