                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The nonprofit Center for Audit Quality explains auditor independence: “Auditors’ independence from company management is essential for a successful audit because it enables them to approach the audit with the necessary professional skepticism.”1 The center goes on to identify a key practice to protect independence by which an external auditor reports not to a company’s management, which could make it more difficult to maintain independence, but to a company’s audit committee. The audit committee oversees the auditors’ work and monitors disagreements between management and the auditor about financial reporting. Internal auditors of a company are not the auditors that provide an opinion on the financial statements of a company. According to the Center for Audit Quality, “By law, public companies’ annual financial statements are audited each year by independent auditors—accountants who examine the data for conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).”2 The opinion from the independent auditors regarding a publicly traded company is filed for public inspection, along with the financial statements of the publicly traded company.</p><br />

choose and why?
1. There are lots of milktea shops which sprout within
your locality. Because of this, you want to have
another line of business which will complement your
milktea business. You come up with an idea of
opening a cake and dessert shop. You hire a cake
and pastry chef and two store attendants. This is in
addition to your existing two milktea shop employees.
Moreover, you will put up two additional stores in the
nearby municipalities. You hire a manager and a
supply officer for each branch and the same number
of employees in the first store. Because of the
growing number of employees, you also hire an
administrative staff to take care of the employment
concerns.
2. You are an overseas Filipino worker who decides to
quit working abroad and put up an agricultural
supply business. You plan to hire one sales clerk,
two warehouse men and one office clerk. You will
oversee the day-to-day operations of the store.
3. Your company knows that your hand sanitizer
sales
seem to have been overtaken by other competitor
brands in the market. The board of directors has
approved your proposal to form a core group who will
conduct a research that will find out the current
demand and trends in hand sanitizers and come up
with a new product. You have instructed the ten area
managers from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao to
send the names of their marketing head and company
researchers. The twenty men and women will be the
members of the national product development group
who will be led by a marketing research head.
Although they are assigned to be a member of this
endeavor, they will still report their participation and
accomplishments to their mother branch manager.</h2><br />
