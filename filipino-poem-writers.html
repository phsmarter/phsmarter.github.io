                        "I do" by Eileen R. Tabios<p>a poem analysis (Part 2)</p><p></p><p><strong>Which does not mean I cannot differentiate between a reflection and a shadow, a threnody and a hiccup, the untrimmed bougainvillea bush mimicking a fire and the lawn lit by a burning cross.</strong></p><p>A point of view that you are that “women” that faces the same situation, the mindset would be that all English speakers are the same as a human being of course. But if we are going to base it on the other side of the spectrum, this would be a really good example of a fallacy. Take it for example in the past, where a lot of countries are being heavily influenced by the superpower countries that until now, describes the same thing. That is why most people now are proficient in English even it is not their first language because of the colonization from them. They think that countries wouldn’t ever thrive if it wasn’t for them. At some point it is true, where the English Language made a breakthrough and change in the different kinds of traditions and culture in other countries. There has been changes such in grammar and accent, they way we behave in public and the ethics that has formed throughout the years. And one of them is the “segregation” of the primary and the ”second language speakers” like our country. A reflection and a shadow have similarities but one of them “blocks” the light that it blocks and “deprives” human rights that is on the shadow, but a reflection would always continue to “bounce” and the cycle never ends unless the inevitable properties of “light” will ever change. It persuades us to change the “light” of the society, where people are discriminated because of their race. A threnody and a hiccup point out the proficiency a person can speak English which is still a synonymous thing and the last phrase point out the different beliefs such as religion, and people assume that a person who has that kind of religion speak that kind of language.</p><p></p><p><strong>Because I do know English, I have been variously called Miss Slanted Vagina, The Mail Order Bride, The One With The Shoe Fetish, The Squat Brunette Who Wears A Plaid Blazer Over A Polka-Dot Blouse, The Maid.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>When I hear someone declare war while observing a yacht race in San Diego, I understand how “currency” becomes “debased.”</strong></p><p>It shows that nationalities can mean a specific stereotype, they could mean a lot of jobs that heats up some controversies as “dirty work” such as prostítutes  and maids and even preferences that are common to one group is being conservative and a lot more traits. Those are really degrading and it shows that you don’t have the ability to do a lot of things. It also applies about how “currency” becomes “debased” where it is the same thought but it applies into a whole nation. The first paragraph stereotypes ethnicity while the second paragraph stereotypes countries.</p><p></p><p><strong>What’s the poem wanted to tell?</strong></p><p>A very prominent fact is until now there are a lot of cases of discrimination, not just on the people who “know English” but also who are challenged in different aspects. The readers would  evoke the thought that the people the same of her kind should be respected as anyone else and not being described as a “lower” human being. The stigma has to be abolished and being a citizen in your own country is never an excuse. We never have to gatekeep and keep other people very suspicious just because of the different stereotypes. Everyone is a human and everyone shall deserve to be given equality on human rights.</p><p><strong>Hope it helps.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>"I do" by Eileen R. Tabios</strong></p><p><strong>a poem analysis (Part 1)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>When we first observe the way that the poem portrays, it indicates that there is someone speaking, in which it is a woman who has the ability to speak English. However, it indicates that whenever you speak English, it doesn’t mean that you are as the “level” as someone else. The English Language is considered as the universal spoken language in the world. That means, a lot of educational institutions reinforce the English Language as part of the curriculum. While a lot of people can speak English, there is still a difference of having the same language as the mother tongue and the learned language and it is really based on your ethnicity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I do know English and, therefore, when hungry, can ask for more than minimum wage, pointing repeatedly at my mouth and yours.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I think this line meant of all of the people who can speak English and at the same time, do work for other nations because they aren’t really contented and they can’t sustain their families in their own country. One good example is Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW’s) who decided to take a risk to make their families better. While this may be noble job but seeing this last phrase has a really suggestive meaning. It expresses the act of kissing one another.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I shall call you “Master” with a lack of irony; lift my cotton blouse; cup my breasts to offer them to your eyes, your lips, your tongue; keen at the moon hiding at 11 a.m. to surface left tendon on my neck. For your teeth. And so on.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>No need to decipher your response—and if you wish, go ahead: spank me.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I can remind you of the rose petals I mailed to you after releasing them from the padded cell between my thighs.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>These lines express an act of a woman of having a sexual intercourse in a literal context, but when we are going to describe it into a more different thought about the ones who can speak English, it could mean that other people who can speak English as they are being demoralized and deprived like being deflowered (in a way that removing a person’s purity rises us on a stereotype on the society that he or she is an outcast). It is not just woman who is involved on such prejudice and discrimination but below is this line that finally opens up what that woman really points out into the poem.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Part 2 of my analysis is on the Brainly Link below:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>brainly.ph/question/12953424</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
