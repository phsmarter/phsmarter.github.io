It is a detailed plan of data gathering and step-by-step procedure in doing the actual experi- ment. In an experimental design, the variables under study are also described and included. Designing and Planning an Experiment Define the Problem What do you want to investigate? State the problem in declarative of interrogative form. State Your Recommendation Are there other problems that come up? What are the things you would like to do to improve the result of the study? Formulate Hypothesis State Your Conclusion The statement of your what do you think will happen? what observations or knowledge in the past are you using in formu- inting the hypothesis? conclusion must be based on the data gathered. Your data should etther support or lead you to another hypothesis. Plan your Experiment Interpret or Analyze Data Is there a need for contral? If so, what is the variable? What are the set standards? Write in detail the methods or procedures of the experiment to make sure that others can repeat the experiment exactly. Write your time table. Do you see patterns or trends in the data? Do the data support your hypothesis? Explain the meaning of the figures. Gather Data What tools are you going to use? Will you observe or measure? How will you gather your data? Organize and Record Data What will you do to organize your data? Will you present them using tables, graphs, diagrams, or Illustrations? ​</a>

Step 2: Research topic area Go to the library and read up on information related to the problem you identified. Review existing records or data. Consult experts who have worked on a similar problem. If your problem affects a particular community, you can interview officials or authorities who have jurisdiction over the area. Step 3: Hypothesize Formulate an educated guess on the factors that affect your particular problem. There are two types of hypothesis: the null and alternative. The null hypothesis (H) is written in the negative form. The alternative hypothesis (H) in the affirmative form Step 4: Test design your experiment and write the step-by-step procedure that you will use to test your hypothesis. Gather the materials that you will need. Identify the treatment that you will implement so that you can compare the results with a reference data. Observe and record what happens when one variable is manipulated or changed. Step 5: Analyze data organize your data into tables and graphs so that it will be easier to visualize your results. Summarize the data presented in your charts and tables. Step 6: Conclude based on your findings and interpretation of the data, draw your conclusions and see if they agree with your hypothesis. if the conclusion supports the hypothesis, then accept your hypothesis and recommend other components for further investigation. Share the difficulties you have encountered in the course of your study, what you will do differently and how. If the conclusion refutes the hypothesis, then reject the hypothesis, accept its counterhypothesis, and then recommend other ways of solving your problem.​</a>

                            24. Topic 1 LESSON 7 Experimental Design An experimental design describes the complete and orderly steps performed in answering a research problem. It is a detailed plan of data gathering and step-by-step procedure in doing the actual experi- ment. In an experimental design, the variables under study are also described and included. Designing and Planning an Experiment Define the Problem What do you want to investigate? State the problem in declarative of interrogative form. State Your Recommendation Are there other problems that come up? What are the things you would like to do to improve the result of the study? Formulate Hypothesis State Your Conclusion The statement of your what do you think will happen? what observations or knowledge in the past are you using in formu- inting the hypothesis? conclusion must be based on the data gathered. Your data should etther support or lead you to another hypothesis. Plan your Experiment Interpret or Analyze Data Is there a need for contral? If so, what is the variable? What are the set standards? Write in detail the methods or procedures of the experiment to make sure that others can repeat the experiment exactly. Write your time table. Do you see patterns or trends in the data? Do the data support your hypothesis? Explain the meaning of the figures. Gather Data What tools are you going to use? Will you observe or measure? How will you gather your data? Organize and Record Data What will you do to organize your data? Will you present them using tables, graphs, diagrams, or Illustrations? ​</h2><br />

Scientific Method at Work Step 1: Observe Question Keen observation of one's surroundings and awareness of tort ownokis Analyze dath Scientific method Test with insverst what is going on around you can lead to ideas that help identify a particular problem. Step 2: Research topic area Go to the library and read up on information related to the problem you identified. Review existing records or data. Consult experts who have worked on a similar problem. If your problem affects a particular community, you can interview officials or authorities who have jurisdiction over the area. Step 3: Hypothesize Formulate an educated guess on the factors that affect your particular problem. There are two types of hypothesis: the null and alternative. The null hypothesis (H) is written in the negative form. The alternative hypothesis (H) in the affirmative form Step 4: Test design your experiment and write the step-by-step procedure that you will use to test your hypothesis. Gather the materials that you will need. Identify the treatment that you will implement so that you can compare the results with a reference data. Observe and record what happens when one variable is manipulated or changed. Step 5: Analyze data organize your data into tables and graphs so that it will be easier to visualize your results. Summarize the data presented in your charts and tables. Step 6: Conclude based on your findings and interpretation of the data, draw your conclusions and see if they agree with your hypothesis. if the conclusion supports the hypothesis, then accept your hypothesis and recommend other components for further investigation. Share the difficulties you have encountered in the course of your study, what you will do differently and how. If the conclusion refutes the hypothesis, then reject the hypothesis, accept its counterhypothesis, and then recommend other ways of solving your problem.​</h2><br />
