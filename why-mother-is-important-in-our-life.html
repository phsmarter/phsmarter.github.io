                                            VIRTUES AMIDST THE PANDEMIC"At the end of the day, all we need is hope and faith."The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been a tragedy for our community and country. With so many parts of our lives that turned upside down, we have to adapt to the "new normal" as our new reality. Despite the uncertainties associated with this crisis, we have seen communities around the world generating hope. Hope provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind, even in tragic situations. To have hope, it is important that we feel a sense of meaning in our lives.In the recent months, we have learned to appreciate two things that give our life meaning - work and connection with friends and family. This pandemic has caused anxieties, fear, and uncertainties. Raising community awareness of mental health issues helps promote a more positive and proactive approach to addressing mental illnesses in this time of pandemic. However, we are capable to be courageous, hopeful, and resilient as we pray for healing around the world.COVID-19 can be considered a blessing in disguise as we look on the brighter side. Because of this global health crisis, we have also learned to value simple things in life. All have been required to stay at home and be with the family. Everyone has started to help each other; family ties have been strengthened. Busy streets and some malls were closed. As a result, pollution was lessened and Mother Earth started to recuperate. We have also realized the importance of hygiene and safety health protocols. The usual daily routine at home and workplace has been changed. Most importantly, we have brought ourselves back again to the Lord and regained our spiritual attachment with Him. This is an awakening call for us to never give up and to see hope in the middle of challenges.Respond to the editorial text on "Virtues Amidst the Pandemic" on page 4 by answering the following questions. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.1. What virtue provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind in tragicsituations?2. What are the two things that we have learned to appreciate in the recent months?3. What are the major changes caused by the pandemic in our community?4. What does the writer want to convey in the editorial text?5. Do you agree that the pandemic serves as an awakening call to all of us? Why or why not?​</a>

1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.
7. Life is beautiful.
Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,
mannerisms, outfits, and ideas stun her family and friends. This causes emotional
unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.

                                            The Glitch
By Divina P. Maming
Dela Cruz family came together for
breakfast. Each had his/her own
story to tell about his/her
experiences for the week. This is the
usual scenario every Sunday
morning.
“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and
Maria could not wait to reach for
their chairs with a big grin on their
faces as they said, “Good morning,
nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged
his shoulders for disappointment.
“Let’s eat!” mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody
seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they
saw him in a really low spirit. “What happened?” at last, the wife asked.
“I may lose my job,” he said with a croaky voice.
“But why?” Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked
towards him and patted his shoulder. “It’s okay. You can still find another job,” she
said offering him a seat.
The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, “Tatay,
don’t worry, we are here to help.”

“Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours,” Tonio said.
“Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income,” Maria added.
Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores.
“Thank you, my dear children,” was all Aling Terie could say.
Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an
all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their
activities in school and how they fared in their subjects.
Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, “I got highest score in
Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate.” Tonio then mentioned
about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked
fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really
work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked
about what she learned from it.
Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing
lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call.
As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment
was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work
the next day again.
All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all
together. “We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual,” Mang Cardo sighed
with relief.

                                            The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</a>

                                            REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.

                                            The Glitch By Divina P. Maming Dela Cruz family came together for breakfast. Each had his/her own story to tell about his/her experiences for the week. This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores. "Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1. What are the different communication scenarios in the story? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 2. How did each communication scenario develop? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 3. Did a conflict arise in the story? What kind of conflict is it? Did it affect the communication process? Was it resolved? How? How did the rest of the family members react to it? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 4. How can we establish a good communication? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 5. What is the importance of communication in our daily life?</a>

With so many parts of our lives that turned upside down, we have to adapt to the "new normal" as our new reality. Despite the uncertainties associated with this crisis, we have seen communities around the world generating hope. Hope provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind, even in tragic situations. To have hope, it is important that we feel a sense of meaning in our lives.In the recent months, we have learned to appreciate two things that give our life meaning - work and connection with friends and family. This pandemic has caused anxieties, fear, and uncertainties. Raising community awareness of mental health issues helps promote a more positive and proactive approach to addressing mental illnesses in this time of pandemic. However, we are capable to be courageous, hopeful, and resilient as we pray for healing around the world.COVID-19 can be considered a blessing in disguise as we look on the brighter side. Because of this global health crisis, we have also learned to value simple things in life. All have been required to stay at home and be with the family. Everyone has started to help each other; family ties have been strengthened. Busy streets and some malls were closed. As a result, pollution was lessened and Mother Earth started to recuperate. We have also realized the importance of hygiene and safety health protocols. The usual daily routine at home and workplace has been changed. Most importantly, we have brought ourselves back again to the Lord and regained our spiritual attachment with Him. This is an awakening call for us to never give up and to see hope in the middle of challenges.Respond to the editorial text on "Virtues Amidst the Pandemic" on page 4 by answering the following questions.

1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.

"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.

8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,

                            9. The Glitch
By Divina P. Maming
Dela Cruz family came together for
breakfast. Each had his/her own
story to tell about his/her
experiences for the week. This is the
usual scenario every Sunday
morning.
“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and
Maria could not wait to reach for
their chairs with a big grin on their
faces as they said, “Good morning,
nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged
his shoulders for disappointment.
“Let’s eat!” mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody
seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they
saw him in a really low spirit. “What happened?” at last, the wife asked.
“I may lose my job,” he said with a croaky voice.
“But why?” Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked
towards him and patted his shoulder. “It’s okay. You can still find another job,” she
said offering him a seat.
The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, “Tatay,
don’t worry, we are here to help.”

Module 2
“Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours,” Tonio said.
“Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income,” Maria added.
Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores.
“Thank you, my dear children,” was all Aling Terie could say.
Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an
all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their
activities in school and how they fared in their subjects.
Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, “I got highest score in
Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate.” Tonio then mentioned
about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked
fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really
work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked
about what she learned from it.
Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing
lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call.
As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment
was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work
the next day again.
All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all
together. “We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual,” Mang Cardo sighed
with relief.

                            10. The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz

”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</h2><br />

                            11. REFLECTION IN FIRST GRADING FOR GRADE-9 SCIENCE
REFLECTION IN MODULE 1
What I learned in module 1 is and how our lungs work, what are its parts where it is located, and where does the air we breathe go, I came to know that it is our blood that takes our oxygen so that we can have energy in our body, the oxygen is very important because oxygen helps replace cells that wear out, provides energy for our bodies, supports the way our immune system functions, Our body needs oxygen why because oxygen to obtain energy to fuel all our living processes, Low blood oxygen levels indicate that there may be an issue with your lungs or circulation. So the air is very important to our body. And I also learned what the order of the parts of the lungs is: Pharynx, larynx, Trachea, Lungs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 2
In module two (2) I learned how cigarettes affect our respiratory and circulatory systems, I always learned how to avoid smoking and stay away from the smoker because you can still inhale the chemical of its smoke, we also studied what are the chemicals in cigarettes, and what can happen to our respiratory and circulatory system, and what diseases can be contracted from cigarette smoke, we have also studied what can happen to your mouth, tongue, and lungs if you smoke, TAR may stick to your lips, your breath may stink, and you may get sick to your lungs.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 3
In module 3 I learned about the components and structure of DNA, genes and chromosomes, and Incomplete dominance and co-dominance. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of four types of nitrogen bases. To form a strand of DNA, nucleotides are linked into chains, with the phosphate and sugar groups alternating. Why genes and chromosomes are important Genes contain the data needed to build and maintain cells and pass genetic information to offspring. Each cell contains two sets of chromosomes: One set comes from the mother and the other comes from the father. Incomplete dominance is when the phenotypes of the two parents blend to create a new phenotype for their offspring. An example is a white flower and a red flower producing pink flowers. Codominance is when the two parent phenotypes are expressed together in the offspring. What is the difference between incomplete dominance and codominance? Codominance signifies that no allele can block or mask the expression of the other allele. Incomplete dominance signifies the condition in which a dominant allele does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele. Similarities Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance both parental alleles inherited are dominant.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 4
The population density of an area can be one of the most important determining factors for business and marketing planning. It is not enough to know how many consumers live in a specific state or city. Population density describes the number of individuals occupying an area in relation to the size of the area they occupy. Studying population growth also helps scientists understand what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates. Clumped dispersion is when individuals in a population are clustered together, creating some patches with many individuals and some patches with no individuals. In uniform dispersion, individuals are spaced evenly throughout an area. And in random dispersion, individuals are arranged without any apparent pattern.
REFLECTION IN MODULE 5
The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy. The goal of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is to collect energy from the sun and break down water molecules to produce ATP and NADPH. These two energy-storing molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces.

                            18. The Glitch By Divina P. Maming Dela Cruz family came together for breakfast. Each had his/her own story to tell about his/her experiences for the week. This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores. "Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1. What are the different communication scenarios in the story? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 2. How did each communication scenario develop? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 3. Did a conflict arise in the story? What kind of conflict is it? Did it affect the communication process? Was it resolved? How? How did the rest of the family members react to it? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 4. How can we establish a good communication? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 5. What is the importance of communication in our daily life?</h2><br />
