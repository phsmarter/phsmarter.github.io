                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The musical called “Fiddler on the Roof” was set in Anatefka, Russia around 1880-1900. During this time, in this small town, held Tevya and his family. Tevya, husband and father of five daughters, is a cynical, obstinate, determined, yet sensitive to feelings, and caring man. He is a clever philosopher and sticks very much to tradition. In the story</p><p>Tevya says “Anatefka is our home...to keep in balance by tradition...”</p><p>This explains the title which is personally understood that through</p><p>Tevya’s eyes, without tradition, life would be as a fiddler on a roof, unbalanced. This story, demonstrates the precarious lives of the</p><p>Russian Jews of the late 19th century. The main character, Tevya, compares their lives to that of a fiddler on a roof…show more content…</p><p>The only main difference was that Hodel and her fiancé didn’t expect permission. They wanted Tevya’s blessings. Tevya, puzzled, upset, and surprised, begins to slowly accept after thinking of the pros and cons. When Tevya does accept, he tells his wife and runs as if not to get scolded.</p><p>The third eldest daughter Chava had a guy in mind also. The only problem was that this guy Fyedka was a Russian Gentile, not a</p><p>Jew. When Tevya noticed that, he could definitely not have that at all. Tevya at first would not give them his blessing, which would break too much tradition, in Tevyas eyes at that time he only saw four daughters. In the end of the musical, the whole village was forced to leave by the Cossaks at the Tzars command. Things still went well with the family leaving because they were leaving to begin a new life in</p><p>America with hope. Tevya was eventually reconciled the fact that there was nothing wrong with a marriage that wasn’t “arranged” by the families and also outside religion. Throughout the story, the concept of changing times is brought up. Tevya accepts that times and traditions are changing, his daughters are grown up and in love, and he accepts the marriages which shows the first step of accepting these changes. As the Tevya says, with everybody knowing their place in the order of life, they are allowed to</p><p></p><br />

The art and culture of our nation are a vast continuum, evolving incessantly since time immemorial.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The culture, traditions, and values of Egypt have a rich and complex history that can be traced back to ancient times. Egypt is a country with a diverse and multicultural society, and this is reflected in its culture, traditions, and values.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important aspects of Egyptian culture is its religion. Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of beliefs and practices that was central to the daily lives of the ancient Egyptians. The gods and goddesses of ancient Egypt were considered to be powerful and mysterious, and they were worshiped in temples and other sacred places. The most important god in ancient Egypt was the sun god, Ra, who was considered to be the creator of all life. Religion played a significant role in the lives of the ancient Egyptians, and it continues to play an important role in the lives of modern Egyptians. </p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of Egyptian culture is its art. Ancient Egyptian art is characterized by its realism and attention to detail. The ancient Egyptians were skilled in a variety of mediums, including painting, sculpture, and architecture.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Culture can be defined as “the arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively.” It can also be understood as the ideas, customs, and social behavior of a particular people or society. Therefore, it’s the shared patterns of our behavior and interaction which are learned through socialization. People of the same culture share a group identity that is fostered by social patterns unique to the group. Culture encompasses for example values, beliefs, symbols, norms, and patterns of behavior. It has a far-reaching impact on our everyday actions, on how we talk and think, what we wear, what we believe, how we sit at the table, and how we behave among other people. But what is the importance of culture in our society? And which components constitute our conception of culture?<p></p>Components of culture<p></p>ValuesBeliefsSymbolsNormsPatterns of behavior<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture and traditions of the Filipino people are deeply rooted in their history and shaped by their interactions with various foreign influences. The Philippines is a country with a rich cultural heritage, and the values that underpin Filipino culture reflect the resilience and adaptability of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p>One of the defining characteristics of Filipino culture is the emphasis on family and community. The Filipino people place great importance on the bond between family members and the sense of belonging that comes from being part of a tight-knit community. This value is reflected in the traditional concept of “bayanihan,” which emphasizes the importance of working together for the greater good of the community.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos are also known for their strong sense of hospitality and warmth towards guests. This value is reflected in the traditional practice of “pakikipagkapwa,” which means treating others with kindness and respect. Filipinos are known to go out of their way to make visitors feel welcome in their homes and communities, and this trait is a key part of their culture.</p><p></p><p>Respect for elders and the elderly is another important value in Filipino culture. The elderly are often considered the repository of wisdom and knowledge, and are accorded high regard in Filipino society. This is reflected in the traditional practice of “pagpapakonsiderado” which means to consider the feelings and needs of others.</p><p></p><p>Religion also plays a significant role in Filipino culture. Roman Catholic Christianity is the dominant religion in the Philippines, but many indigenous communities have retained their traditional spiritual practices. The values of respect and devotion to God, family and country are imbued in the Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these values, Filipino culture is also known for its rich artistic traditions. The Philippines has a long history of folk music, dance and visual arts. These traditions are often deeply connected to the natural environment and reflect the spiritual beliefs of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the culture and traditions of the Filipino people are shaped by their history and interactions with various foreign influences. The values that underpin Filipino culture reflect the resilience and adaptability of the Filipino people, and are deeply ingrained in their daily lives. These values, traditions and culture make the Filipino people who they are today, and will continue to shape their future.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Filipino food is a mixture of sweet, salty, and sour flavours. Rice figures heavily — this is Southeast Asia, after all! — and coconut is of utmost importance, with all parts of the coconut (including the sap and leaves) used in cooking and preparation. </p><p>2. Traditional games are seen as the best platform for "promoting peace, harmony, goodwill and camaraderie" in various Philippine communities especially that today's generation is different, most kids are stuck on their phones, iPods, and PSPs while sitting on a corner. </p><p>3. The Filipino culture is an exuberant story that tells of the nation's journey through the centuries. Customs reflect the people's faith, their oneness with others, their affinity with nature, and their celebration of life.</p><p></p><p>The Filipino's charm lies in their smiles, in the numerous religious festivals that venerate nature, the Divine and the cycles of life and in the virtue of pakikipag-kapwa tao that treasures relationships, with friends and strangers alike. The concept of kapwa(others) is at the core of the Filipino soul. A Filipino scholar says of the Filipino: the joy of his being is in being with others.</p><p></p><p>The nation's charm is in the diversity in ways of life across the archipelago, the resplendent colors of its folk arts and the cacophony of foreign influences that have found roots in the Filipino languages, customs and traditions. </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>ḍ̴͙̲͕̓͆͂̅͠͝</p><p>̶̛̣̤̰̋̋͌̑̾͗͂͛͛̆̇̈̿̔̎͘̚͠ ̴̡̢̧̘̪̖̪̼͙̹̩̜͎̬͕̜̜͈̣̩͎̃̈́̌̇̈́̊̿̌̆̍͋̓̀̌̊̎̀̀̈͘͜͝</p><p>̵̛̫̞̥͉͉̱̰͈͑͋̀̓͐̆͆̆̂̾̑͒̽̇̃̒̚͘͝ ̵̡̨̢̝̠͓̗̠̯̼̲̩͎͍̺̖̘͍̲̮̖̈́̈́͊͜͝ ̶̡̧̛̮͇̞͈̖̜̫͈̼̬̼̥̩́͛̈́̃̐̈́́̀̓̍̏͊̅̆̏͊͗̊̒̚͘ ̴̢̡̡̦̘̥̣͕͔̰̦͈͉͉̥̼͈͎̻͔̗́̏̾̒̀́̽͂̉͋͗͒̀̆͐͊̈́̚͜͝͝ͅ</p><p≯̛̛̦̠̗͇͈̟̘̔̐͐̅̓̒͊̆̈̓͆̂̚̕͘͜ ̶̡̧̛̦̣̞̤̫͖͓̥̭͉̯̱̺̖͖̘͉̝̤̺͑͌̐̽͌̓͌̏̋̓͆͆̊́̉̇̆̈́̓̀̚̕͠</p><p≯̺͙͇̦̯̱͈̼̝̼̯̙̝͖̭̞͋̀̉͛͊̑̓̃͝ͅ ̵̢͇͎͉̦̗̠̰͖͙͎̰̾̌͆́̉̊̋͐̄͊̓͛̌͌̽̒̍̇̑̐̎̕͘̕͜</p><p>̵̥͈̤̬͙̱̹̂̋̉̔̏̂̈̌̐̈́́̐̿̽̅͆̋͝</p><p≯̧̡̧̛̪͚͔̻̮̣͍͇̬̬͚͓͎̼̪̓̓̇͛̀́̂̄̓́́̍́̇̿̊͗́͂͘̕͘̚</p><p>̷͔̦̹̜̠͕̩̱̼͑ ̸̢̪̖̤̪̣̙̥͚̟͓̣͓̮̹͉͉͇͕͋̓̂̓̿͂</p><p>̶̧̢̛̛̙͚͚̖͓̪͔̟̬͎̥̰̈́̈́̂̽̆̊̔̿̿̓̃̎͆͆̓̐̕͘͠͠ ̵͙̥̋͆̈́̉͛͆̓̀̄̌̄͊̾̌̈́͊̔̽͝͠</p><p>̶̡̘̞̳̩̣͇̒̿͂͂͌̅̎͒͝ͅ ̷̧̙̭̝̺͔̣̫̠̇͑̄̍̀́̉͋͑̊̐̀̉̆̊̕</p><p≯̨̝̦̙͈̬̹̮͇͎̬̠͎͓͕̘̖̥̜̘͚͌͐</p><p>̴̫̜͚̮̹̪̊̑̊̌̏̍̃͆͘͜͝ ̸̨̡̳̱̮̲̫̲̦͈̳̘̮̭̹̘͖̙̄͒̀̎̔̓̑͆̓͌̀͛̑̐́̋̈́̚͝͝</p><p>̶̨̢̥̺̠̗̥͎͔͖̼̙͍͇͉̃̉̐͊̈́́̍̕͝j̴̭͔͇̣̜̟̥̯̱͖̦̻̦̳̭̝̮̲̽̈̋͗j̵̡̧̤̠̗͇̙̦̥̠̣̀̐̂̈̀̂̑̄̂̊͑͠͝ͅd̷̟̒̌͋̌̈̑̒̐̏͆́͑̇̀͂͋̊͆̚͠j̴̨̡̧͙͕̠̗̙͈̩̼͍̙̪͖̭̞̠̺̪̥̲̤̎̈͌͋͋̾͆̂̎͆̓̿̉͘͝ş̷̨̢̛͙̯̹̠̺̦͓̻͈̬̪͓͑̈̽͒͛͜͝ͅ</p><p>ess </p><br />

                        <p>Bizarre traditions are customs and practices that may seem strange or unusual to people from other cultures or backgrounds. These traditions can vary greatly in terms of their origins, significance, and practices, but they all share the common characteristic of being considered unusual or out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>One example of a bizarre tradition is the ancient practice of foot binding in China. This tradition involved tightly wrapping the feet of young girls to prevent them from growing too large, creating a small and dainty appearance that was considered attractive and desirable. The practice was painful and caused a variety of health problems, but it was considered a mark of beauty and social status for many centuries.</p><p></p><p>Another bizarre tradition is the custom of consuming raw fish and rice, known as sushi, in Japan. This practice may seem strange to people who are not accustomed to eating raw food, but it is a beloved and deeply ingrained tradition in Japanese culture. Sushi is often prepared with a high level of skill and attention to detail, and it is considered a delicacy and a symbol of Japanese culture.</p><p></p><p>Despite their strange or unusual nature, bizarre traditions often hold deep meaning and significance for the people who practice them. They can be a source of cultural pride and identity, and they can provide a sense of connection to the past and to one's ancestors.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Traditional reviews provide a broad overview of a research topic with no clear methodological approach Systematic reviews are overviews of the literature undertaken by identifying, critically appraising and synthesising results of primary research studies using an explicit, methodological approach.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A narrative or traditional literature review is a comprehensive, critical and objective analysis of the current knowledge on a topic. They are an essential part of the research process and help to establish a theoretical framework and focus or context for your research.</p><p></p>Traditional reviews provide a broad overview of a research topic with no clear methodological approach(2). Information is collected and interpreted unsystematically with subjective summaries of findings. Authors aim to describe and discuss the literature from a contextual or theoretical point of view. Although the reviews may be conducted by topic experts, due to preconceived ideas or conclusions, they could be subject to bias.<p></p>Systematic reviews are overviews of the literature undertaken by identifying, critically appraising and synthesising results of primary research studies using an explicit, methodological approach(3). They aim to summarise the best available evidence on a particular research topic.<p></p><p></p><br />

                            30. essay about Traditional Class and online class​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are some students who find it easier to work in internet classrooms and some others that find it easier to stay with traditional classrooms.  I think someone may choose internet classrooms if they have difficulty interacting with teachers and other students.  Some people do not like being in the classroom because they do not feel at ease around certain people especially those who treat others with disrespect.  It is hard for a student to concentrate and learn a lesson when they have that kind of pressure.
</p><p>
</p><p>When learning lessons over the internet, you might think its great that you can study anytime and anywhere.  Sometimes other things can get in the way of your study time.  When you go to school, there is a schedule to go by and nothing can really get in the way to distract you from studying.  Being in the classroom listening to a teacher is much more interesting than sitting at home staring at a computer monitor.  Not every teacher makes lessons interesting but most do, so I think it outweighs learning over the internet.
</p><p>
</p><p>A lot of different courses are offered over the internet.  Some of these may be the right choice for certain students.  One problem I see with this is that when the student has a question or does not understand something, they would have to research it instead of having a person to person interaction with the teacher.  Also the teacher may sometimes offer examples that come from personal experiences.</p><p></p><br />
