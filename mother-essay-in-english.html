                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

Do you know why children are so inclined to learn from television, whether for good or for bad? Because a television set is never too busy to talk to children. It never brushes them aside. Television programming goes to considerable lengths to attract and hold the attention of youngsters, and it succeeds. Meanwhile, many fathers and mothers spend a minimum amount of time and effort maintaining direct contact with their children. Then they wonder why their children do not turn out as they would like them to.

Original Context
The two types of surrogacy currently known to date are traditional and gestational surrogacy. For the traditional
method, the surrogate mother is artificially inseminated either by an intended father or an anonymous sperm donor, as
the surrogate mother will have planned to bear her own child. Hence, the child is related to both the surrogate mother,
and the intended father or the anonymous sperm donor. People who usually do this would want to raise a child without
sexual intimacy from the opposite sex. In the gestational method however, an egg is removed from the hopeful mother,
to be fertilized by the sperm of the intended father. The fertilized egg is then implanted into the uterus of the surrogate
mother, who will carry the child to term. In contrast with the traditional method, the child is not related to the surrogate
mother but only to the intended father or the anonymous sperm donor and the mother who possessed the egg.

Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4. "Patchwork Girl" is a work of electronic literature by American Author, Shelley Jackson.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a satirical essay, Swift uses Rogerian strategy along with other rhetorical tactics such as specific diction, nuclear emphasis, and multiple double meanings to effectively surface the horrific treatment of the Irish by the English aristocracy. Rogerian strategy focuses on the “open exchange of ideas directed toward mutual understanding” with emphasis on conceding certain points to gain an understanding of the opposition and in doing so gain ground rather than losing it through a hostile exchange of right and wrong (Cooper/Patton 70). Swift carefully organized his essay so the audience, the English Aristocracy, would not recognize it as satire and dismiss it right away. Swift begins with a quasi-believable tone, one of an economist trying to solve a problem. The current “deplorable state of the kingdom” calculated by Swift consists of one hundred twenty thousand children who need to steel and beg just to remain alive (Swift 298). Many before him tried to provide useful solutions but failed. The Irish now left with nothing but what the English give them suffer mass oppression, the real issue Swift wishes to address.

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Swift establishes a mutual understanding with the English from the beginning, an essential part of the careful construction in his essay. He cannot let on the essay will take a dramatic turn after the flip of the second page. Swift does this because he wants to give the impression that he shares the same views on the current condition of the kingdom. He wants the English aristocracy to identify with him and his views. When he states “ I think it is agreed by all parties…” in the second paragraph and in the fourth “As to my own part…maturely weighed the several schemes of other projectors but have found them grossly mistaken in their computation” Swifts uses a small bit of Rogerian strategy (Swift 298). First he agrees with them on a small point so they are not hostile when later he states their past proposals have miscalculations. This bit of Rogerian serves the purpose of warming up the audience so they get used to agreeing with Swift and having an open mind to new suggestions much like an opening act does for the nights main act. Swift continues to warm up the audience by recognizing that these children are “a charge upon their parents” but more importantly to the English “a charge upon…the parish.” All the “warm...

                            4. Read the example of a descriptive essay below.My Mother, My Strength!My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with asweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, thefeeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. Sheteaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raisingme up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I wasyoung because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than aprofessional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for herteaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in theInternet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom dealswith them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this.Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which Ienvy.They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes. My mom isthe dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.Answer the following questions. 1.what did the writer compare her mother with?2.write at least three sentences that described the mother based on the essay.3.Based on the given example,what is descriptive essay?

                            8. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                            9. liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1.

Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

Do you know why children are so inclined to learn from television, whether for good or for bad? Because a television set is never too busy to talk to children. It never brushes them aside. Television programming goes to considerable lengths to attract and hold the attention of youngsters, and it succeeds. Meanwhile, many fathers and mothers spend a minimum amount of time and effort maintaining direct contact with their children. Then they wonder why their children do not turn out as they would like them to.

Original Context
The two types of surrogacy currently known to date are traditional and gestational surrogacy. For the traditional
method, the surrogate mother is artificially inseminated either by an intended father or an anonymous sperm donor, as
the surrogate mother will have planned to bear her own child. Hence, the child is related to both the surrogate mother,
and the intended father or the anonymous sperm donor. People who usually do this would want to raise a child without
sexual intimacy from the opposite sex. In the gestational method however, an egg is removed from the hopeful mother,
to be fertilized by the sperm of the intended father. The fertilized egg is then implanted into the uterus of the surrogate
mother, who will carry the child to term. In contrast with the traditional method, the child is not related to the surrogate
mother but only to the intended father or the anonymous sperm donor and the mother who possessed the egg.

Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4. "Patchwork Girl" is a work of electronic literature by American Author, Shelley Jackson. I was written in Storyspace and published by Eastgate Systems in 1995, and tells the story through illustrations of parts of a female body that are stitched together through text and image. A short essay on "Patchwork Girl" entitled "Stitching Together Narrative, Sexuality. Self" by Brown University English Professor, George P. Landow, can be found here 5.
