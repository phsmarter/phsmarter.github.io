                                            Read the following narrative essay: In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.

It is said that no one can live alone without any human interaction. Maybe because, there is something more to a human that just himself.</p><p></p><p>Anybody will agree to me when I say that we have different source of happiness. We can be happy just by doing the things we love, may it be as extreme as sky diving or as relaxing as a day at the spa. Everything that we love doing reflect on what we are as a person and it may sometimes be hard to find someone who can get along the things we want to do. The only thing happier for me than just spending the day doing the things we love is actually being able to do it with someone we love. The best experiences happen when we have someone to share it with. A bestfriend who knows a lot of things about you from your wildest dreams to your little thoughts is the best one to share it with. A life with my bestfriend is one of the best moments of my life. I think these moments will not be that special without my bestfriend. I truly believe that no man is an island for above the moments that happened and will happen is the person who is beside me through it all.</p><p></p><p>My life will not be as happy as I think it would be without my best friend. Yes, there is more to a human than just himself, because above this, is the person next to him, ready to pick him up whenever he falls and ready to jump when he jumps, no other than, the one dearest to his heart, his bestfriend. </p><p></p><p>Here is another essay about friendship:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1791486</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>How People Grieve<p></p>When someone dies, the people who loved that person may seem different for a while. They might cry a lot or feel angry or confused. Or maybe, like Sarah, they're just more quiet than usual.<p>These are different ways of coping, or grieving (say: GREEV-ing). Coping and grieving are two words that describe the way people adjust to or deal with a difficult change in their lives. The death of a loved one is a big change, and people cope and grieve in different ways. That's OK. There isn't one right way to grieve.</p><p>It's hard to know which ways you will cope or grieve until you face a difficult change. You might want to be alone and sit in your room. Or maybe you would want to talk with your mom, dad, or another grown-up about the person you miss. You also might want to scream at the top of your lungs — even if you're usually a calm kid.</p><p>And some kids might just want to get back to normal life — go to school, play, do the regular things they usually do. All these feelings are normal and a person might experience a whole lot of different feelings while he or she is going through this hard time.</p><p></p>How You Can Help<p></p>When it's a friend who's dealing with the death of a loved one, you might be able to help them. Just still being a friend is important. How nice it feels to see a good friend when you are feeling low! You may feel shy about it, but it might be a good idea to bring up the subject. For example, Kate could say, "Sarah, I'm sorry about your grandma."<p>That's a way for Kate to let Sarah know that she feels sad for her. It may help Sarah start talking about her feelings. But it's also OK if Sarah doesn't want to talk much about it. Kate also could simply say: "If you want to talk about it, I will listen." That's a really kind thing to say.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>CARRY ON LEARNING</p><p>THANKS ME LATER</p><p>GOOD LUCK</p><p>BRAINLIES</p><br />

                        <p>My Favorite Food</p><p></p><p>Nothing beats a good meal. When it comes to food, everyone has their own favorite. Mine is Italian food. Nothing compares to the deliciousness of Italian cuisine. From the starches to the sauces, all the foundations of a great meal are in Italian food. </p><p></p><p>My love of Italian food started around age 5. I can vividly remember the first time I tried it. It was at a local Italian restaurant. The moment I took my first bite of the lasagna, I knew it was something special. I could taste the flavors of the tomato and garlic, and was extremely impressed. After that moment I knew I was hooked.</p><p></p><p>Since then, I have become an Italian food connoisseur. I know all the tricks and shortcuts to make a great tasting meal. From marinating the meats, to the right cheese, I have my process to make the perfect Italian dish. It is something I look forward to doing each week. No matter how difficult the meal, I am always up for the challenge.</p><p></p><p>Italian food is always in my heart and on my plate. It is a great reminder of why I love food so much and how even something as simple as a dish can bring joy into my life.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>how to be a good friend</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Being a good friend is an important part of life. Good friends are there for each other through thick and thin, and they provide emotional support and comfort when needed. To be a good friend, it is important to listen actively and be empathetic to your friend's needs. When your friend is talking to you, put aside distractions and give them your full attention. Try to understand their perspective and feelings without judging them. By showing your friend that you care about them and their feelings, you can build a strong and lasting friendship.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of being a good friend is to be reliable and trustworthy. If you promise to do something for your friend, make sure you follow through with it. Keep their secrets and respect their privacy. If you can be counted on to be dependable and keep your word, your friend will know that they can rely on you in times of need.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, being a good friend means being able to communicate honestly and openly with your friend. If you have concerns or issues with your friend, it's important to talk about them openly and without judgment. Be willing to listen to their perspective and work together to find a solution that works for both of you. By being honest and open with each other, you can strengthen your friendship and build a foundation of trust and respect that will last a lifetime.</p><p></p><p></p><p>pa brainly naman</p><p>nagawa ko na to dati</p><br />

I can feel inside me that I am unique in every little way just like how other people are unique from others too.
