                                            In this lesson, you will be taught to differentiate the language used in different disciplines such as Business, Law, Art, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Science, Sports and TechVoc. Learning about the language as used in context will improve your understanding and widen your knowledge on the varied academic texts from various disciplines.Language plays a vital role in our daily conversation. This language may be used in communicating with other people either spoken or written. Taking into accounts, academic language takes place in our professional dealings. This language varies especially when used in various  disciplines. For instance, the word 'division' may be used differently in parliament, mathematics and sports. Read and analyze  the short text below to learn about this matter.Which _process_ is stronger and more important? Which process we shall encourage and which discourage? A competition which makes sure that humans are still going forward or cooperation which assures that we are still human beings and can solve common problems together. A dilemma that has always existed, a natural choice  that human  beings has been confronted. Fortunately it was the greatest skill of humans to combine these two paradoxically contradictory  processes to produce the world we are living now and to keep  improving it. -Competition_ can be defined as a process where one being  rivals the other in reaching certain objective faster and smarter. It is a _force_ that has been given by nature and has assured that only those who deserve to survive will be able to do it. Long before the human beings have appeared on earth other creatures were  competing with each other for a single aim of survival. Advent of humans didn't change the basic import of competition. They started to complete  not only with  other animals environing them but also  with animals of the same kind, namely, humans. Competing with environment allowed humans to take control of it and produced improvements, innovation and modernizations that humans have enjoyed throughout their _evolution_. However, competition and cooperation are merely one side of the same coin. When competition is a rival between two or more to reach an aim, cooperation is an agreement to reach that aim together. Competition makes sure that only strongest survive regardless of the purpose, cooperation insures that the survival is adhered to the purpose. An _organization_ of people to reach a common aim can be narrowly called as a society, and society was enabled only by cooperation. _Cooperation_ is a force that assured a leading role of humans on this planet, a continuation of a progress of human beings.Guide Question:1.

                                            Sample Reading Text: When we survey our lives and efforts we soon observe that almost the whole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings. We notice that whole nature resembles social animals. We eat food that others have produced, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. The greater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been passed on to us by other people though the medium of a language which others have created. Without language and mental capacities, we would have been poor indeed comparable to higher animals. We have therefore to admit that we owe our principal knowledge over the least to the fact of living in human society. The individual if left alone from birth would remain primitive and beast like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardly imagine. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he ha not much in virtue of the individuality, but rather as a member of a great hum community, which directs his material and spiritual existence from the cradle grave.Here are the questions:1:what is the message of the text?2: what are the things that you understand form the text?3: what do you think are the important points to be remembered in the text?4: what is the message of the text?kinda need na Yung answer(nonsense answer report) hehe​</a>

                                            Exercise 4 Vocalizations that might be construed as symbols of various sorts in different animals are usually accompanied by gestures. One student found that only 3 percent of the signals among rhesus monkeys were not accompanied by gestures. Whatever animals express through sounds seems to reflect not a logical sequence of thoughts but a sequence accompanying a series of emotional states. Animals' communicative activities thus differ from human language in that they consist essentially of signs not arbitrary symbols. (p.470) Markel, M. (1996).

                            4. In this lesson, you will be taught to differentiate the language used in different disciplines such as Business, Law, Art, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Science, Sports and TechVoc. Learning about the language as used in context will improve your understanding and widen your knowledge on the varied academic texts from various disciplines.Language plays a vital role in our daily conversation. This language may be used in communicating with other people either spoken or written. Taking into accounts, academic language takes place in our professional dealings. This language varies especially when used in various  disciplines. For instance, the word 'division' may be used differently in parliament, mathematics and sports. Read and analyze  the short text below to learn about this matter.Which _process_ is stronger and more important? Which process we shall encourage and which discourage? A competition which makes sure that humans are still going forward or cooperation which assures that we are still human beings and can solve common problems together. A dilemma that has always existed, a natural choice  that human  beings has been confronted. Fortunately it was the greatest skill of humans to combine these two paradoxically contradictory  processes to produce the world we are living now and to keep  improving it. -Competition_ can be defined as a process where one being  rivals the other in reaching certain objective faster and smarter. It is a _force_ that has been given by nature and has assured that only those who deserve to survive will be able to do it. Long before the human beings have appeared on earth other creatures were  competing with each other for a single aim of survival. Advent of humans didn't change the basic import of competition. They started to complete  not only with  other animals environing them but also  with animals of the same kind, namely, humans. Competing with environment allowed humans to take control of it and produced improvements, innovation and modernizations that humans have enjoyed throughout their _evolution_. However, competition and cooperation are merely one side of the same coin. When competition is a rival between two or more to reach an aim, cooperation is an agreement to reach that aim together. Competition makes sure that only strongest survive regardless of the purpose, cooperation insures that the survival is adhered to the purpose. An _organization_ of people to reach a common aim can be narrowly called as a society, and society was enabled only by cooperation. _Cooperation_ is a force that assured a leading role of humans on this planet, a continuation of a progress of human beings.Guide Question:1.

One student found that only 3 percent of the signals among rhesus monkeys were not accompanied by gestures. Whatever animals express through sounds seems to reflect not a logical sequence of thoughts but a sequence accompanying a series of emotional states. Animals' communicative activities thus differ from human language in that they consist essentially of signs not arbitrary symbols. (p.470) Markel, M. (1996).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>How do humans and other animals communicate with each other?<p></p><p>Animals communicate with each other in many different ways; they use body language, sound, smell, touch and even chemical and electrical communication. ... Apart from learning human words, animals also have their own set of words that they use to talk to each other.</p><p></p>What is the title of the text? _Body language ?<p></p><p>Body language is a type of nonverbal communication in which physical behaviors, as opposed to words, are used to express or convey the information. Such behavior includes facial expressions, body posture, gestures, eye movement, touch and the use of space. </p><p></p>in terms of communication, what are compared in the text?<p></p><p>→ Spoken text is more informal and longer than written text, and uses more words and more sentences. → Spoken sentences also tend to be shorter than those found in essays.</p><p></p>How do humans communicate?<p></p><p>Human beings communicate with incredible detail using language, but we are also probably more detailed visual communicators than other animals. ... Speech and language, vocalisations such as grunts, then a range of other noises can be communicative – lip-smacking, clapping hands, foot-tapping, and so on.</p><p></p>How do animals communicate?<p></p><p>Animals communicate using signals, which can include visual; auditory, or sound-based; chemical, involving pheromones; or tactile, touch-based, cues. Communication behaviors can help animals find mates, establish dominance, defend territory, coordinate group behavior, and care for young.</p><p></p>How do dolphins and whales communicate?<p></p><p>Toothed whales communicate using high-frequency clicks and whistles. Single click sounds are used mainly for echolocation while multiple clicks are used to communicate with other whales and even dolphins in the area. ... Baleen whales use low-frequency sounds, and these can be heard over long distances.</p><p></p>87 What do you think will happen if humans do not communicate with each other?<p></p><p>A lack of communication can ultimately lead to low morale.

                            25. When we survey our lives and efforts we soon observe that almost the whole of ouractions and desires are bound up with the existence of other human beings. We noticethat whole nature resembles that of the social animals. We eat food that others have produced, wear clothes that others have made, live in houses that others have built. Thegreater part of our knowledge and beliefs has been passed on to us by other peoplethough the medium of a language which others have created. Without language andmental capacities, we would have been poor indeed comparable to higher animals.We have, therefore, to admit that we owe our principal knowledge over the least to thefact of living in human society. The individual if left alone from birth would remainprimitive and beast like in his thoughts and feelings to a degree that we can hardlyimagine. The individual is what he is and has the significance that he has, not much invirtue of the individuality, but rather as a member of a great human community, whichdirects his material and spiritual existence from the cradle to grave.Questions:1.What is the meaning of the text?2.What are the things that you understand from the text?3.What do you think are the important points to be remembered in the text?4.What is the message of the text?​​</h2><br />
