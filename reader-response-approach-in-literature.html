                                            1. This approach sees a literary work as a reflection of the author’s life and times or the life and times of the characters in the work.2. This approach takes the position that the larger function of literature is to teach morality and probe philosophical issues, such as ethics, religion, or the nature of humanity.3. It assumes that everything necessary for analyzing the work is present in the work itself and disregard any connection to possible outside influences.4. This approach asks us to use a wide variety of issues related to gender, concerning the author, the work itself, the reader, and the societies of the author and reader.5. This viewpoint considers particular aspects of the political content of the text; the author; the historical and socio-cultural context of the work; and the cultural, political, and personal situation of the reader in relationship to the text.6. Literature should be viewed as a performing art in which each reader creates their own, possibly unique, text-related performance.choicesMoralistFeministHistoricalMarxistReader-responseFormalist​</a>

It assumes that everything necessary for analyzing the work is present in the work itself and disregard any connection to possible outside influences.4. This approach asks us to use a wide variety of issues related to gender, concerning the author, the work itself, the reader, and the societies of the author and reader.5. This viewpoint considers particular aspects of the political content of the text; the author; the historical and socio-cultural context of the work; and the cultural, political, and personal situation of the reader in relationship to the text.6.
