The movie creates a kid friendly version of a popular Greek mythology tale. There are many <strong>compare</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>contrast</strong><strong> </strong>to the movie and mythology version and it come down to one’s personal opinion of which one is better.</p><p></p><p>~<strong>B</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>H</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PARENTS</strong></p><p></p><p>In the popular <strong>DISNEY</strong><strong> </strong><strong>MOVIE</strong>, Hercules is the son of Zeus and Hena, both gods but in the <strong>MYTHOLOGY</strong><strong> </strong>he is the sun of Zeus and a mortal woman. </p><p></p><p>In both of these stories, Hercules is always the son of Zeus and always described as loved by his father.</p><p></p><p>~ <strong>TRANSFORMATION</strong><strong> </strong><strong>IN</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HERO</strong></p><p></p><p>In the <strong>DISNEY</strong><strong> </strong><strong>MOVIE</strong>, Hercules becomes a god when he risks his life to save Meg, the girl he falls in love with. Once he turns into a god, he wishes to stay mortal and live with Meg. In the <strong>MYTHOLOGY</strong><strong> </strong>tale, Hercules must complete 12 labors in order to become a god. Once he becomes a god he stays one. </p><p></p><p>In both of the stories, Hercules had to perform almost impossible tasks in order to become a god. </p><p></p><p>~ <strong>1</strong><strong>2</strong><strong> </strong><strong>LABORS</strong></p><p></p><p>In the <strong>MYTHOLOGY</strong><strong> </strong>, in order for Hercules to turn into a god, he must complete 12 labors. When he completes them, he turns into a god and reunites with his father. In the <strong>DISNEY</strong><strong> </strong><strong>MOVIE</strong>, the show some of the labors for example when he kills Hydra.

Meg, also known as Megara is Hercules’s first wife which he later kills by Hena’s orders. Megara is not an important character except for her death. In both stories, Meg acts as a mortal love interest and dies in both, except Hercules saves her life in the movie.</p><p></p><p>~<strong>M</strong><strong>U</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>S</strong><strong> </strong><strong>AND</strong><strong> </strong><strong>TITANS</strong></p><p></p><p>In the <strong>DISNEY</strong><strong> </strong><strong>MOVIE</strong>, the muses lead us through the story and sing many of the songs. There were 5 of them in the movie but in the <strong>MYTHOLOGY</strong>, there were 9, all daughters of Zeus. The Titans were the antagonists of the movie version of Hercules but but in mythology, they were kind and predecessors to the gods.</p><p></p><p>~<strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>G</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>U</strong><strong>S</strong></p><p></p><p>In the <strong>DISNEY</strong><strong> </strong><strong>MOVIE</strong>, when Hercules is born Zeus gives him a present made out of clouds.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Mountain Between Us, It, Murder on the Orient Express, Wonder, My Cousin Rachel. These films released in 2017 have one thing in common, and you may have guessed it already: They were all books that were later adapted into movies.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Similar to its affinity for sequels and remakes, it seems to me like Hollywood is increasingly looking to books for inspiration for the next blockbuster hits. From a business standpoint, it makes total sense because producers can draw on the popularity of a certain book and use that to their advantage when it comes to marketing the film’s release.</p><p></p><p>As an avid reader, I am always excited at the news that a book is being adapted as a feature film. My mind is occupied by thoughts of who the actors/actresses are going to be (and if I approve), if the film will stay true to the book, and most importantly, if the movie will be just as good as the book. The thought of finally being able to visualize what has only previously been limited to my imagination is always an exciting prospect.</p><p></p><p>However, I am usually underwhelmed after watching a certain film based on a book, and if you asked me a year ago which one I would prefer: the movie or the book, I would have immediately chosen the book.</p><p></p><p>Hands down. No doubt. However, within the past year, I have come to appreciate movie adaptations of books more because I have realized that comparing books to their counterpart movies isn’t fair; at the end of the day, the two mediums of storytelling have different advantages and different qualifications for what makes them good. Like Stephen King once said, comparing one to the other is like comparing apples to oranges. They are both great sources of entertainment, but they aren’t comparable. For those still reluctant to accept this theory, I’ll be delving more into this age-old question: “What’s better: books or movies?” I’ll make a case for each argument and let you make the final call.</p><p></p><p>The popular belief is that books are often a hundred times better than their movie counterparts; if you need any further proof, just take a look at the following Washington Post visual.</p><p></p><p>Books are great because they allow the reader to be a part of the story; we are the observers that have insight into the character’s thoughts and feelings, and all the nuances that create three-dimensional characters. With books, there’s just more. More detail, more focus on character development, and more depth to the meaning of the artwork. It’s also the more time-consuming form of the two, and after finishing a novel, after a couple of hours of being immersed into a different world and mind space, it seems like you have suddenly been thrust back into reality.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the great thing about movies is their ability to show, and the overall experience of watching one. While reading a book, I often have a movie reel playing in my head. I can map out the setting, I can see the characters’ expressions, and I can empathize with their emotions.</p><p></p><p>However, watching the same story unfold on the big screen is a different experience. While reading spurs your imagination, a movie helps you visualize all the elements of the books that were previously confined to your imagination. It immerses you into the story in a different way than a book.</p><p></p><p>For example, instead of reading about the magical world of Harry Potter, while watching the movie, I can actually see what J.K. Rowling means by “He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild – long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.” To put it simply, movies make it easier for us to just lean back and enjoy the show.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Comparing and Contrasting Ideas on Online Learning vs. Traditional Classroom Learning</p><p></p><p>Online learning and traditional classroom learning are two methods of education that have their unique advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, in online learning, students have the flexibility to study at their own pace and schedule, while in a traditional classroom, students follow a set schedule. However, online learning lacks the social interaction and support provided by a traditional classroom, where students can ask questions and receive immediate feedback. Additionally, online learning requires self-motivation and self-discipline, as students may struggle to stay focused and engaged without the structure of a classroom environment.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, traditional classroom learning allows for face-to-face interaction between students and teachers, creating a more dynamic learning experience. Students can also benefit from the collaboration and teamwork fostered in a classroom environment, which may be difficult to achieve in online learning. However, traditional classroom learning may be less flexible, and students may miss classes due to scheduling conflicts or health issues. Furthermore, traditional classroom learning may be limited in its resources, as it relies on physical textbooks and materials, while online learning provides a wealth of digital resources that are easily accessible.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, both online learning and traditional classroom learning have their pros and cons, and the choice between the two depends on individual learning preferences and circumstances. It is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each method to make an informed decision that suits one's learning needs.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa Brainliest and follow if nakatulong </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Books vs Movies</strong></p><p>Both books and films can tell stories, elicit emotions, and probe ideas. Although these two are very different as you might think, aside from the fact that one is written on paper and the other is performed. In books, the author spends a lot of time describing characters, events, objects, and locations. These lengthy descriptions are required to assist the reader in forming a mental image of the story. There are no lengthy details in movies.</p><p>Reading a book is much more difficult to do than watching a movie. When compared to written works such as books, a motion picture is more visual and easier to remember. Reading can stimulate your imagination because you will be a part of the story, but watching a movie allows you to easily visualize the situation. Movies have different genres and are awarded for them as well, whereas books have their own novels and novelties for which they are awarded. Books are written by authors or poets, but movies are created by a large group of people who contribute in various ways.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Whenever your essay topic involves comparison, you can organize in either of two ways. First, you can write about each thing separately and then include a section in which you make comparisons and contrasts between them. With this organization, you would first write about the strengths and weakness of the book, and then about the movie. In a third section you would make a series of statements comparing and contrasting major aspects of them both. If you choose this approach, make your separate discussions of the book and movie parallel — that is, for the movie, address the same points in the same order you used for the book. Also, in the third section of the paper, avoid simply repeating what you said in sections one and two. This approach can be especially effective if the book and movie are drastically different from each other.</p><p>A second way of organizing requires you to decide first which aspects of the book and movie you want to compare and contrast (setting, character development, tone, and so on) and then structure your paper around those points. For example, if you use setting, you would have one section of your paper to describe the setting in both the book and the movie and to compare them. Next you compare the character development in both versions, then the tone, then the imagery, and so on. Two advantages of this type of organization are, first, you are forced to focus on specific similarities and differences and less likely to include material that isn't important, and, second, you avoid repetition by ditching the separate compare-and-contrast section.</p><p></p><p>You can also combine these two types of organization. For example, you may want to discuss the overall plot structure of the movie and the book separately, and then move into a point-by-point comparison of the other aspects of the two versions (characters, setting, tone, and so on).</p><p></p><br />
