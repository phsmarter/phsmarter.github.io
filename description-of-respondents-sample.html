                                            Activity 4: Strength and Weakness of Quantitative 
Research
Directions: Determine if the description given below is a strength or weakness 
of quantitative research. Write your answer on separate sheet of 
paper
1. The most reliable and valid way of concluding results, giving way to a new 
hypothesis or to disproving it. 
2. Since, there are more respondents compared to qualitative research, the 
expenses will be greater in reaching out to these people and in reproducing 
questionnaires. 
3. If not done seriously and correctly, data from questionnaires may be incomplete 
and inaccurate. 
4. Standardized approaches allow the study to be replicated in different areas or 
over time with formulation of comparable findings. 
5. Quantitative experiments are useful for testing the results gained by a series 
of qualitative experiments, leading to a final answer, and narrowing down of 
possible directions to follow. 
6. It is assumed that the larger the sample is, the more statistically accurate the 
findings are. 
7. Researchers must be on the look-out on respondents who are just guessing in 
answering the instrument. 
8. It does not consider the distinct capacity of the respondents to share and 
elaborate further information unlike the qualitative research. 
9. It is real and unbiased. 
10. Standardized questionnaire used in original paper cannot always be used in 
other study</a>

The purpose of this chapter is to design the methodology of the research approach through mixed types of research techniques. The research approach also supports the researcher on how to come across the research result findings. In this chapter, the general design of the research and the methods used for data collection are explained in detail. It includes three main parts. The first part gives a highlight about the dissertation design. The second part discusses about qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. The last part illustrates the general research framework. The purpose of this section is to indicate how the research was conducted throughout the study periods.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p>STUDY WELL<br />

paper
1. The most reliable and valid way of concluding results, giving way to a new 
hypothesis or to disproving it. 
2. Since, there are more respondents compared to qualitative research, the 
expenses will be greater in reaching out to these people and in reproducing 
questionnaires. 
3. If not done seriously and correctly, data from questionnaires may be incomplete 
and inaccurate. 
4. Standardized approaches allow the study to be replicated in different areas or 
over time with formulation of comparable findings. 
5. Quantitative experiments are useful for testing the results gained by a series 
of qualitative experiments, leading to a final answer, and narrowing down of 
possible directions to follow. 
6. It is assumed that the larger the sample is, the more statistically accurate the 
findings are. 
7. Researchers must be on the look-out on respondents who are just guessing in 
answering the instrument. 
8. It does not consider the distinct capacity of the respondents to share and 
elaborate further information unlike the qualitative research. 
9. It is real and unbiased.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The respondents are selected randomly, with no rules. Simple random selection can be compared to "drawing lots"; every respondent has the same chance of being picked. All characteristics of a population can be covered easily using this method. But its results have to be taken as general.</p><p></p><p>2. Depending on the researcher's</p><p>research plan and design, there</p><p>are several ways data can be</p><p>collected. The most commonly used</p><p>methods are: published literature</p><p>sources, surveys (email and mail),</p><p>interviews (telephone, face-to-face or</p><p>focus group), observations, documents</p><p>and records, and experiments.</p><p></p><p>3. Simple random sampling: One of the best probability sampling techniques that helps in saving time and resources, is the Simple Random Sampling method.
