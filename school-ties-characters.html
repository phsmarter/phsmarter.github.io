                                            "Josefina"(By May Shynne J. Torralba)Josefina was different from the rest of the girls in the class. She was with theboys most of the time and she liked to play with things that are usually played byboys. Everyone knew that she was an orphan. She was only ten years old when sheleft home to forget the heartaches brought by the tragic death of her parents. Shethought that it was best to leave home and go on with her life under the roof andguidance of her auntie and uncle.In school, she never showed weakness. Her classmates liked her because shewas courageous and agile. She was not afraid to fight with boys. Her curly hair wasalways tied up to show her neatly shaved undercut. Though she was a bit different,her classmates gave the same mutual respect towards her. This made Josefinaexpressed herself freely- from the way she dressed up to the way she carried herself.Nobody dare or care talked about her personal feeling. Not until one morning...Marcelina, her classmate, saw Josefina ran outside the gate of the school. Outof curiosity, she followed her. She called for her but Josefina kept on running untilshe was hidden behind the big tamarind tree. She saw Josefina wailing while herright hand was bleeding for punching the trunk of the tree. Reluctantly, Marcelinashowed herself to her with sympathetic look. Without a single word, Marcelina tookher hand and wiped it until it was clean. Upon hearing the silence, Marcelina tookthe opportunity to ask her classmate. "What happened?" she sighed before shebrought the words out of her mouth. Josefina looked at her and responded clearly."I am scared. I overheard that my auntie and uncle are giving me away because theycould not afford the provision needed to raise me. I don't want to but I was left withno choice. I don't know how other people would treat and accept me. They mightonly laughed and mocked at me because I am different." Marcelina felt herclassmate's honest confession. Then, she comforted her. "You think so much ofthings that has not yet happened. Is it really a sarcastic mouth that scares you orthat small voice inside you? You just need to be you... that is all. No matter whathappens remember that we are always here to comfort you and boost you up." Shepatted her shoulder and smirked to uplift her. The conversation made Josefina feltlighter hence, they made their way back to school.Questions1. Who are the characters in the story?2. Where and when did the story happen?3.

                                            Isle Sitting in the beach, admiring the calmness of the sea, giving complements in the natural beauty of rocks and shells in the shore, being mesmerized by the golden sunset while listening to the music jig in her favorite radio station is the vibe. Enjoying these things gave her serenity, but suddenly, an infomercial played in her earphones on how to avoid COVID-19 pandemic---wash your hands, wear your face mask, pray and follow social distancing. She had heard these reminders multiple times, but the words 'social distancing' hit her this time. They kept reverberating on her mind down to her heart until she found herself looking in her tough fists as if they have a lot to say.She wiped her crystal teardrops, took a deep breath, shut her eyes, and internalized the meaning of social distancing in life. She opened her secretive fierce eyes as she seized a drop of her soft drinks. Again, she wiped her tears and looked around. In a distance, she saw a group of five joyous, whimsical, and girly high school students. She smiled in a bitter-sweet manner, shook her head to avoid the different scenarios flashing in her head, but she failed. Once again, she shut her eyes, and there she saw the same senior high. student dumped by her lover, and now she's losing herself as her friends left her when she needed them the most. Being in a group to being alone was what she experienced. She did not expect that they would comfort her with a lie and betrayed her. She saw this young girl begging for her friends to listen and comfort her, but no one arrived to give her a hug and shoulder to lean on. No one chose her and cared for what she felt. And with all the suffering humanity caused her, she made a stand to cut ties from people. She came back to reality, took a deep breath, opened her eyes, and let the soothing wind touched her skin. Now, a genuine smile glimmers in her face as she realized the pain and lesson social distancing caused her.context: what genre is it? science, fiction, fantasy, literary?authors intention: what is the author trying to accomplish with the story?your reaction: note your reactions as tou read, either keep a spare piece of paper with you or mark your reaction on your paper.literary devices: figures of speech used in the story and their purposeliterary techniques: ask yourself if these literary techniques makes the reading experience more enjoyable or strengthen the storyending of the story: decide how the ending relates both to the story as a whole and to its beginning. does the ending resolve the plot and bring closure to the crisis of the character​</a>

                            5. "Josefina"(By May Shynne J. Torralba)Josefina was different from the rest of the girls in the class. She was with theboys most of the time and she liked to play with things that are usually played byboys. Everyone knew that she was an orphan. She was only ten years old when sheleft home to forget the heartaches brought by the tragic death of her parents. Shethought that it was best to leave home and go on with her life under the roof andguidance of her auntie and uncle.In school, she never showed weakness. Her classmates liked her because shewas courageous and agile. She was not afraid to fight with boys. Her curly hair wasalways tied up to show her neatly shaved undercut. Though she was a bit different,her classmates gave the same mutual respect towards her. This made Josefinaexpressed herself freely- from the way she dressed up to the way she carried herself.Nobody dare or care talked about her personal feeling. Not until one morning...Marcelina, her classmate, saw Josefina ran outside the gate of the school. Outof curiosity, she followed her. She called for her but Josefina kept on running untilshe was hidden behind the big tamarind tree. She saw Josefina wailing while herright hand was bleeding for punching the trunk of the tree. Reluctantly, Marcelinashowed herself to her with sympathetic look. Without a single word, Marcelina tookher hand and wiped it until it was clean. Upon hearing the silence, Marcelina tookthe opportunity to ask her classmate. "What happened?" she sighed before shebrought the words out of her mouth. Josefina looked at her and responded clearly."I am scared. I overheard that my auntie and uncle are giving me away because theycould not afford the provision needed to raise me. I don't want to but I was left withno choice. I don't know how other people would treat and accept me. They mightonly laughed and mocked at me because I am different." Marcelina felt herclassmate's honest confession. Then, she comforted her. "You think so much ofthings that has not yet happened. Is it really a sarcastic mouth that scares you orthat small voice inside you? You just need to be you... that is all. No matter whathappens remember that we are always here to comfort you and boost you up." Shepatted her shoulder and smirked to uplift her. The conversation made Josefina feltlighter hence, they made their way back to school.Questions1. Who are the characters in the story?2. Where and when did the story happen?3.

                            8. Isle Sitting in the beach, admiring the calmness of the sea, giving complements in the natural beauty of rocks and shells in the shore, being mesmerized by the golden sunset while listening to the music jig in her favorite radio station is the vibe. Enjoying these things gave her serenity, but suddenly, an infomercial played in her earphones on how to avoid COVID-19 pandemic---wash your hands, wear your face mask, pray and follow social distancing. She had heard these reminders multiple times, but the words 'social distancing' hit her this time. They kept reverberating on her mind down to her heart until she found herself looking in her tough fists as if they have a lot to say.She wiped her crystal teardrops, took a deep breath, shut her eyes, and internalized the meaning of social distancing in life. She opened her secretive fierce eyes as she seized a drop of her soft drinks. Again, she wiped her tears and looked around. In a distance, she saw a group of five joyous, whimsical, and girly high school students. She smiled in a bitter-sweet manner, shook her head to avoid the different scenarios flashing in her head, but she failed. Once again, she shut her eyes, and there she saw the same senior high. student dumped by her lover, and now she's losing herself as her friends left her when she needed them the most. Being in a group to being alone was what she experienced. She did not expect that they would comfort her with a lie and betrayed her. She saw this young girl begging for her friends to listen and comfort her, but no one arrived to give her a hug and shoulder to lean on. No one chose her and cared for what she felt. And with all the suffering humanity caused her, she made a stand to cut ties from people. She came back to reality, took a deep breath, opened her eyes, and let the soothing wind touched her skin. Now, a genuine smile glimmers in her face as she realized the pain and lesson social distancing caused her.context: what genre is it? science, fiction, fantasy, literary?authors intention: what is the author trying to accomplish with the story?your reaction: note your reactions as tou read, either keep a spare piece of paper with you or mark your reaction on your paper.literary devices: figures of speech used in the story and their purposeliterary techniques: ask yourself if these literary techniques makes the reading experience more enjoyable or strengthen the storyending of the story: decide how the ending relates both to the story as a whole and to its beginning. does the ending resolve the plot and bring closure to the crisis of the character​</h2><br />
