                            1. ESSAY: Write a short essay explaining the importance of recycling. Use the template below. Importance of Recycling​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Reducing waste, reusing materials and products, and recycling are some of the most extremely powerful ways individual, households, and business can protect environmental. By simply making smart decisions as to what we buy and how we get the most away from our purchases, we can work together to lower the amount of waste. Reusing discarded products and using recycled materials in order to make new products reduces the usage of virgin materials, which often involves harvesting trees and mining the earth. Even better, “source reducing” waste — or avoiding the generation of discards in the first place — saves the absolute most resources. Manufacturers of natural resources, such as bauxite or aluminum ore, and improving them to make products use energy. Often fossil fuels produce this energy. When people throw away these things, they send them to landfills, where they can last for centuries or more completely to split up. Reducing, reusing, and recycling helps reduce human exposure to the environment, carbon dioxide emissions, and energy use, and limits the number of people in the landfill.</strong></p>But most importantly, it will help us to save our planet. Besides, recycling saves the earth by facilitating the reprocess of paper which will save millions of trees. Also, recycling saves a lot of energy because many things that we recycle can easily be converted into virgin materials. In addition, it saves a lot of resources too. Moreover, recycling reduces the burden on the environment. As we save energy the number of greenhouse gases and oxides are produced in less quantity. Because most of the toxic gases are produced by factories. But, the process of plastic recycling is a little bit complex because they have to sort out the different types of plastics. As there is a diverse variety of plastic with different properties. In addition, sort your waste and dump your recyclable waste in the recycle bin so that the authorities can recycle it.<p>   </p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Paki highlight nalang po yung important stuff</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Recycling is very important for saving the Earth. Reusing, reducing, and recycling are the three important R’s that we must follow to help our planet be healthy. Recycling means to take the raw materials of objects and remake them into new objects which we can use again.</strong></p><p><strong>Humans produce lots of waste every day, including paper, plastic, metal, and glass waste. This means used water bottles or soft drinks bottles and cans, waste paper, old jars and bottles which are made of glass, etc. These are some things which can be easily recycled in special recycling centers. Over there, these things are broken into small pieces, melted, then put back together as a brand new and usable object.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>We can also recycle many things at home by using them to make useful and fun craft projects. For example, you can make pencil stands out of metal cans or plastic bottles by cutting their top off. We should separate our garbage into dry and wet waste at home to make sure that the recycled objects go to the recycling centers.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Recycling can be done in many other ways too, and we should always try to recycle as much as we can.</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>\color{red}\rule{20pt}{9999999pt}}</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If we want to preserve Earth for our future generations, recycling is really important. Since we are making new products from the old products which are of no use to us, it is good for the environment. If waste is not recycled, it can negatively impact our environment in many ways.</p><p></p><p>A common symbol that can be seen on garbage bags, dump trucks and trash cans is of recycling. The phrase ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’ is taught to children all over the world in the hope of creating a clean environment. We all know that recycling is a simple way in which every person can contribute to making a better world.</p><p></p><p>However, <strong>surely there must be more benefits of recycling than just reducing the amount of trash we throw out. After all, it takes time and effort to collect, separate and send away the trash. But the fact is that there are many ways in which this process makes for a better and happier world.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Conserve Natural Resources</strong></p><p>Scrap cars, old bottles, junk mail and used rubber tires are becoming common features of our landfills. All of these may seem endless, but the resources required to make them are finishing off quickly. Recycling allows all of these junk items to be used over and over again so that new resources do not have to be exploited. It conserves natural resources such as water, minerals, coal, oil, gas and timber.</p><p></p><p><strong>Recycling is crucial for Protecting ecosystems and wildlife</strong></p><p>Waste can impact animals and, consequently, humans because of the food chain. Waste can cause loss of natural habitats and contributes to negative impacts like climate change and global warming, which can also destroy animals’ natural habitats. When animals and other biological organisms lose their habitats, they can die off or starve<strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>.Conserve Natural Resources</strong></p><p>Scrap cars, old bottles, junk mail and used rubber tiresReduce the Size of Landfills</p><p>One of the biggest reasons why recycling has been promoted is that it does reduce the strain on our environment. By utilizing waste products in a constructive way, we can slowly decrease the size of our landfills. As the population grows, it will become difficult for the landfills to hold so much and trash. When this happens, our cities and beautiful landscapes will face pollution, poisoning and many health problems. The benefits of recycling are that it helps to keep the pollution in check and decrease it little by little</p><p></p><p><strong>Reduce the Size of Landfills</strong></p><p>One of the biggest reasons why recycling has been promoted is that it does reduce the strain on our environment.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I am  _______, a grade 8 student, and 13 years of age.</p><p></p><p>I dream of having a cleaner and greener world not only for me, my family, and friends to enjoy, but for the future generations too. One way of achieving this dream is through effective waste management.</p><p></p><p>Waste management is the collection, transport, processing or disposal of waste materials, usually ones produced by human activity, in an effort to reduce their effect on human health or local aesthetics or amenity. I am not like Ms. Greta Thunberg, the 17 year old Swedish environmental activist on climate change, whose campaigning has gained international recognition. What I am, however, is a disciplined student and a daughter who wants to help change the environment through my own small actions. </p><p></p><p> I pledge to Refuse to buy or accept products that can harm myself, my school, my home and the environment. I will start by asking questions such as “Why are we purchasing this item?” or, “Why do we need this?". </p><p></p><p>I pledge to Reduce, to use less. I will start by asking the question:  “What is the minimum amount necessary?”</p><p></p><p>I pledge to Reuse by reusing something I already have instead of buying something new. </p><p></p><p>I pledge to Repurpose by taking something and use it for something else. For example, i can repurpose scrap papers for taking notes.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, I pledge to Recycle. I can achieve this by turning organic food wastes from our house into soil fertilizers. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This was my answer on my 7th grade essay I just copied it from my notes, I did got a perfect score tho hihi it's quite long but ikaw na bahala mag summarize if u want :) </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Recycling is one of the 3 R’s, reduce, reuse, and recycle, which aims at promoting sustainable living. Recycling refers to when we convert something which can be considered waste into a new product. For example, when you buy a plastic bottle of water, you can send it to recycling centers to be made into something like plastic bags rather than throwing it away. Recycling is one of the most important waste management practices, and it is essential to follow for sustainable living.</p><p></p><p>hope it help</p><br />

                            9. Why is Recycling an important practice at home?essay​</h2><br />
                        Recycling is important practice at home because<p></p><p><strong>Reduces energy waste</strong> – it is a known fact that using recycled resources in the process of manufacturing uses considerably less energy than what is normally required to produce new products out of raw materials.</p><p></p><p><strong>Reduces the need for clearance</strong> – nobody likes to see their home in a state of mess, and yet that is what often happens when you accumulate too much junk. When you recycle the products you use, you will ultimately reduce the need to clear out items you have no more need of. That is why recycling in the form of donating or selling so that other people can use some of your belongings are two fine options for you to consider.</p><p></p><p><strong>Important for children</strong> – if you want your children to grow up to be responsible towards nature and the environment, you better teach them how to recycle. It is not difficult at all even for young children to understand that paper, plastic and aluminum cans should be put in different containers and not just thrown out as garbage. Turn it into a game and that way you will have them engaged in a very useful activity, which will only teach a valuable lesson for the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>Recycling is easy </strong>– it is not hard at all to separate the usable materials, such as plastic and paper from your everyday activities and discard them in a cautious manner. You can make two additional containers in your home and toss the said items there, allowing for their recycling later on. This will not only reduce the need for additional waste clearance, but also contribute to a good cause.</p><p></p><p><strong>Help the environment</strong> – the most substantial benefit of recycling is that it reduces the need to create raw materials in the process of extraction, refinement and processing. This in turn leads to a reduction in water and air pollution, which is a recipe for a greener and better tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>With pressing environmental issues such as pollution and global warming on the rise, it's no surprise that people are becoming more interested in green living. People are beginning to recognize the significance of environmentally friendly practices, which is a positive development in the long run.</p><p></p><p>To begin to mitigate the negative impact of human activity on the environment, each individual must make an effort on his or her own. There are numerous ways in which you can contribute to making the world a greener place. Some steps in that direction have a greater impact than others, such as the installation of green energy features and consideration of environmentally friendly house demolition. If you want to avoid wasting 80-120 percent of your mattress's useful life, consider a biodegradable latex mattress.</p><p></p><p>It spent years decomposing in a landfill, just like the majority of mattresses. One thing is certain: everyone should put forth their best effort and make a positive contribution.</p><p></p><p>Recycling at home is an excellent way to reduce your carbon footprint, and you should get started as soon as possible. Repurposing old products that are no longer needed by converting them back into usable materials is made possible by this technology. It is simple to implement and manage, and it is something that everyone who cares about the environment should think about implementing. Think about recycling some of the junk you've accumulated for the junk removal service the next time you take a look at your collection. Here are a few of the undeniable benefits of recycling that you should know about:</p><p>1, Reduces energy waste: It is well known that using recycled resources in the manufacturing process uses significantly less energy than what is normally required to produce new products from raw materials.</p><p>2, Reduces the need for clearance – Nobody wants to see their home in shambles, but that is frequently what happens when you accumulate too much junk.</p><p>3, When you recycle the products you use, you reduce the need to get rid of items you no longer need. That is why recycling in the form of donating or selling your belongings so that others can use them are two excellent options for you to consider.</p><p>4, Important for children: if you want your children to grow up caring about nature and the environment, you should teach them how to recycle. Even young children can understand that paper, plastic, and aluminum cans should be separated and not thrown away in the same container. Make it a game, and you'll have them engaged in a very useful activity that will only teach them a valuable lesson for the future.</p><p>5, Recycling is simple—it is not difficult to separate usable materials, such as plastic and paper, from your daily activities and dispose of them responsibly. You can create two additional containers in your home and place the aforementioned items in them, allowing for their recycling later. This will not only reduce the need for additional waste clearance, but will also help a worthy cause.</p><p>6, Help the environment: The most significant advantage of recycling is that it reduces the need to create raw materials in the extraction, refinement, and processing processes. This, in turn, reduces water and air pollution, paving the way for a greener and better tomorrow.</p><p>Recycling at home is really not that hard as you’d imagine. All it takes is some motivation to get it going and soon enough you will feel good about doing a good deed.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlist salamat &lt;33 </p><br />

                            10.  argumentative essay about recycling​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Have you ever seen a water bottle or an empty bag of Doritos on the ground, and you just kept walking?  Next time, pick it up, and see how big of a difference it can make.  Recycling is important and should be done because it reduces the need for landfills, reduces the amount of pollution, and protects the environment and animal habitats.  This issue is affecting the whole planet, and this is a big issue because if people don’t recycle, conditions could get worse, and people don’t recycle as often as they should.</p><p></p><p>     </p><p></p><p>Firstly, recycling reduces the need for landfills.  If we recycle, items don’t need to go to landfills because people will still be using them. (MidCityScrap)  This shows that recycling reduces need for landfills.  Next, 60 -75% of garbage in landfills can be recycled (MidCityScrap)  This shows that, if we just recycled more, landfills would be emptier.  Lastly, if we recycled more, more landfills wouldn’t have to be built around cities, which is affecting environment and wildlife. (ConserveEnergyFuture)  This shows that recycling more means that less landfills, and safer environments as an added bonus.</p><p>     </p><p></p><p>Secondly, recycling reduces the amount of pollution.  The more you recycle old products, the less you will need to buy any new products, which means you’ll be saving energy. (ConserveEnergyFuture)  Since energy is a major problem with pollution, saving energy means less pollution. Secondly, trees being converted into paper is the most water-intensive industrial process in the United States.  However, paper recycling mills almost always use less water, plus, they don’t pollute it as much. (Princeton)  This shows that if we recycled paper more often, we wouldn’t pollute as much.  Finally, incinerators let out many types of air pollutants, so recycling would reduce the need for incinerators. (Princeton)  This shows that incinerators wouldn’t be as common, so pollution wouldn’t be as common, either.</p><p>     </p><p></p><p>Lastly, recycling protects the environment and animal habitats. First off,  because we are constantly having to make new paper because paper isn’t being recycled, half of Earth’s trees are gone.  Around 90% of original forest in the United States has been chopped down. (Princeton)  Since many animals need trees to survive, trees are needed to protect the environment and ecosystem.  Second, using recycled materials lowers the need to use natural resources like timber or mineral ores.  (ConserveEnergyFuture)  Since many animals also need these to survive, these need to be kept to keep them living.  Finally, people cut down trees and destroy animal habitats in order to build landfills and pollutant-producing incinerators.  That means if we recycle, animal habitats and environments can be safe.</p><p>   </p><p></p><p> Others may say that recycling is a waste of time.  However, recycling is not a waste of time because if one person recycles, and other people begin to recycle also, it will all add up.  Opponents may also say that recycling isn’t going to get us anyway.  However, recycling will get us somewhere because we will have less garbage, less pollution, and a better environment.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Reducing need for landfills, reducing the amount of pollution, and protecting the environment and animal habitats are all reasons why we recycling is important and why we need to do it.  Next time you see an empty water bottle on the ground, go throw it in the nearest garbage can, and you could have saved an animal, environment, or the whole planet</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>How Recycling can help save Mother Earth?</strong></p><p>When we recycle plastic, we reduce the need for new plastic to be made. Through recycling paper, we help to reduce deforestation and save trees from being felled. Separating cans and other metals helps to minimize toxic extraction and our ever-increasing need for raw materials. <strong>(summary:  Recycling Conserves Resources)</strong></p><p></p><p>It takes much more resources to produce industrial-grade products from scratch than it does to reform and reuse old materials. Recycling conserves energy because recycled products do not require manufacturers to emit as much greenhouse gas emissions as they would if the same object were made from scratch using raw materials.<strong>(summary: Recycling Saves Energy)</strong></p><p></p><p>When we reduce the amount of new materials and natural resources we need to harvest from the earth, whether by planting, mining, forestry, or other means, we protect fragile habitats and animals from damage or extinction and ensure their survival for future generations. Recycling products releases far less greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than primary processing. </p><p><strong>(summary:  Recycling Protects the Environment)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>There are 2,000 operating landfills in the United States alone, all of which are full of industrial waste that release greenhouse gases into the environment as it eventually decomposes. This does not include the many that have been closed due to storage, or the potential landfills that will be needed as the current landfills run out of space.<strong> (summary: Recycling Slows the Spread of Landfills)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>That's right: believe it or not, one of the advantages of recycling is that it helps to build work! According to a Friends of the Earth report, achieving a 70 percent home recycling rate will generate 51,400 jobs in the United Kingdom alone. In the United States, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) discovered that achieving a national recycling rate of 75% would result in the production of 1.5 million new jobs.<strong> (summary:  Recycling Creates Jobs)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Our sustainability, as well as the futures of future generations, is dependent on sustainable development and consumption. As a result, recycling is one of the most important strategies to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. <strong>(summary: Recycling Supports the SDGs)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>brainliest please!</strong></p><p> </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>dapat wag gumamit ng plastic dapat ilagay ang basura sa tamang basurahan wag mag tapon ng basura sa mga ilog </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>PA FOLLOW AT PA HEART NETO</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>No﻿</p><p></p><p>Landfill meat, also known as "recycled meat" or "waste meat," refers to meat that has been processed and harvested from animals that have been discarded in landfills. This meat is typically processed using various techniques to remove any contaminants, and it is considered safe for human consumption.</p><p></p><p>While the idea of eating meat that was once discarded in a landfill may seem unappealing to some people, there are potential benefits to this practice. For example, recycling landfill meat could help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and contribute to a more sustainable food system. It could also provide an affordable source of protein for people who may not have access to other types of meat.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also potential risks associated with consuming landfill meat. The quality and safety of the meat may be compromised due to the conditions in which it was raised and processed. Additionally, there may be concerns about the ethical treatment of animals that end up in landfills and the potential for disease transmission.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A circular economy closes the loop between the two ends of a linear economy, allowing for the waste material collected at product disposal to be used as resources for material sourcing. Waste-as-a-resource changes our outlook on waste.</p><p></p><p>The reason why recycling is so important is that it prevents pollution, reduces the need to harvest new raw materials, saves energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, saves money, reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, and allows products to be used to their fullest extent.</p><p></p><p>This consumption consists of fuels in the form of gas, coal, and oil; quarried materials such as stone, gravel, and sand; industrial minerals such as phosphate, cement, and gypsum; industrial metals such as copper and aluminum; forestry products such as sawed timber, pulpwood for paper, and firewood; and agricultural ...</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The idea of eating recycled landfill meat might sound appalling to some people, but it's important to take a closer look at the potential benefits and drawbacks of this concept.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, recycling landfill meat could help reduce food waste and increase food availability, especially in areas where there are shortages or limited resources. This would be an environmentally sustainable way to make use of food that would otherwise be discarded, reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there are concerns about the safety and health risks associated with consuming recycled landfill meat. It is possible that the meat could be contaminated with harmful substances or pathogens, which could pose serious health risks to those who consume it. Additionally, there could be ethical concerns about the idea of eating meat that was originally intended for disposal.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while the idea of eating recycled landfill meat may seem unappetizing or even unpalatable to some, it is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of this concept. Ultimately, it will be up to consumers to decide whether or not they are comfortable with the idea of eating meat that has been recycled from a landfill. However, it is important to ensure that proper safety measures are put in place to ensure that any recycled meat is safe and healthy to consume.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
