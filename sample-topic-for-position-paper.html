Committee: General Assembly Topic: Global Warming Country: The Kingdom of Sweden Delegates: ***************** Global warming's effects and influence on the global climate is visible all around us now. As time has passed in the past century, Arctic ice has begun to gradually melt and sea levels have started to rise. If this situation continues, then low-lying island nations such as Vanuatu and Maldives will sink into the sea and will simply disappear. Also, climate is changing in many parts of the world because of global warming. For example, acid rain damaging soils and forests, particularly in our country, serious droughts in Australia, and abnormal weather patterns all over the world. These things are not naturally occurring phenomena - they were caused by human actions. Our nation is addressing global warming on a domestic level. For example, we are separating household waste and recycling as much as we can, and are imposing taxes on CO2 emissions. Out carbon dioxide emissions are 0.4% of the global total. We are raising public awareness of the environmental problems they will face in the future, and we hope that our people will address this issue. But individual nations cannot succeed - the only way to secure our future is if we can get a consensus of nations to take action to reduce these effects. Humans caused this problem and ultimately they must address and deal with it. We must, as global citizens, address this problem actively.

Committee: General Assembly Topic: Global Warming Country: The Kingdom of Sweden Delegates: ***************** Global warming's effects and influence on the global climate is visible all around us now. As time has passed in the past century, Arctic ice has begun to gradually melt and sea levels have started to rise. If this situation continues, then low-lying island nations such as Vanuatu and Maldives will sink into the sea and will simply disappear. Also, climate is changing in many parts of the world because of global warming. For example, acid rain damaging soils and forests, particularly in our country, serious droughts in Australia, and abnormal weather patterns all over the world. These things are not naturally occurring phenomena - they were caused by human actions. Our nation is addressing global warming on a domestic level. For example, we are separating household waste and recycling as much as we can, and are imposing taxes on CO2 emissions. Out carbon dioxide emissions are 0.4% of the global total. We are raising public awareness of the environmental problems they will face in the future, and we hope that our people will address this issue. But individual nations cannot succeed - the only way to secure our future is if we can get a consensus of nations to take action to reduce these effects. Humans caused this problem and ultimately they must address and deal with it. We must, as global citizens, address this problem actively.
