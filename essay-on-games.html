                        <strong>Title: "Fortnite Review"</strong><p></p><p>Fortnite has taken the gaming world by storm since its release in 2017. It's a battle royale style game that has players fighting to be the last one standing on an island filled with weapons and resources. The game is free to play, with in-game purchases available for players who want to customize their character or buy in-game currency.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that sets Fortnite apart from other games is its building mechanic. Players can collect resources from the environment and use them to build structures, which can be used for protection or as a way to gain an advantage in combat. The building aspect adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, as players have to constantly consider their surroundings and how they can use their resources to their advantage.</p><p></p><p>Another feature that makes Fortnite stand out is its regular updates and events. The developers are constantly adding new weapons, skins, and game modes to keep things fresh and interesting. The events, which often have unique challenges and rewards, are a great way to mix up the gameplay and provide players with new content to keep them coming back.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest criticisms of Fortnite is its reliance on microtransactions. While the game is free to play, many players feel that the in-game purchases give an unfair advantage to those who are willing to spend real money. While it's true that players can progress and be competitive without spending any money, the option to buy items and currency can be tempting for some.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Fortnite is a fun and addicting game that has a lot to offer players of all skill levels. Its building mechanic and regular updates keep things interesting, and the battle royale style of play adds an element of tension and excitement. While the microtransactions can be a point of contention for some players, they are not necessary to enjoy the game.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Video games are most often classified into groups that represent what kind of system they are played on, like games that are made for computer systems or games that are made for consoles. These genre include action, shooter, action-adventure, adventure, role-playing, simulation, strategy, puzzles, cards, and race. About Music Genre, Music can be divided into genres in varying ways, such as popular music and art music, or religious music and secular music. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>K</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>z</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>A</strong><strong> </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>K</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>N</strong><strong>A</strong><strong> </strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong><strong> </strong><strong>K</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>M</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>K</strong><strong>O</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>   The Southeast Asian Games, also known as the SEA Games (SEAG), is a biennial multi-sport event involving participants from the current 11 countries of Southeast Asia. My family used to love catching these live. The games are under the regulation of the Southeast Asian Games Federation with supervision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA).</p><p> The Southeast Asian Games is one of the five subregional Games of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). The others are the Central Asian Games, the East Asian Youth Games, the South Asian Games, and the West Asian Games.</p><p>   We once had a jounalism project at school to collect information all about its history. It is said that the Southeast Asian Games owes its origins to the South East Asian Peninsular Games or SEAP Games. On 22 May 1958, delegates from the countries in Southeast Asian Peninsula attending the Asian Games in Tokyo, Japan had a meeting and agreed to establish a sports organization. The SEAP Games was conceptualized by Luang Sukhum Nayaoradit, then Vice-President of the Thailand Olympic Committee. The proposed rationale was that a regional sports event will help promote co-operation, understanding, and relations among countries in the Southeast Asian region.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You're welcome, thanks, and good luck re-writing that on your paper lol.</p><p>;)</p><br />

                        <p>As the world progresses, technology advances, and new forms of entertainment are constantly being created. One such example is online gaming. It has become increasingly popular in recent years, with people of all ages playing games on their computers, laptops, and even phones. Many experts have argued that exposure to online games can have a number of negative effects on children and adolescents. These effects can range from addiction and poor school performance to aggression and social isolation. While there are many positive aspects to this trend, there are also some potential drawbacks that should be considered.</p><p>Most online games are designed to be addictive, with many features that keep players coming back for more. With constant updates, new content, and in-game rewards, it's easy to see why people can get hooked. This can lead to people spending excessive amounts of time playing them, to the detriment of other activities such as work, studying, or socializing. In some cases, this can even result in mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.</p><p>Another issue with online gaming is that it is often very isolated. Players can spend hours sitting in front of their screens, interacting with nobody else in the real world. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and social isolation.</p><p>It is also worth noting that many online games are designed to be played with others. However, this can also lead to problems, as it can foster a sense of competition and envy between players. In extreme cases, this can even lead to cyberbullying. While online gaming can be a fun way to connect with friends and others who share your interests, it’s imperative to be aware of the potential risks. Competition can be healthy, but it can also contribute to negative feelings like envy and resentment. And in some cases, people have been known to use online games as a way to bully others.</p><p>In conclusion, online gaming can be a fun way to relieve boredom or stress, but it’s also essential to be aware of the potential risks involved. In some cases, people have become addicted to online gaming and it has had a negative impact on their lives. If you find that you’re spending too much time playing games, it may be time to cut back.</p><br />

Rice figures heavily — this is Southeast Asia, after all! — and coconut is of utmost importance, with all parts of the coconut (including the sap and leaves) used in cooking and preparation. </p><p>2. Traditional games are seen as the best platform for "promoting peace, harmony, goodwill and camaraderie" in various Philippine communities especially that today's generation is different, most kids are stuck on their phones, iPods, and PSPs while sitting on a corner. </p><p>3. The Filipino culture is an exuberant story that tells of the nation's journey through the centuries. Customs reflect the people's faith, their oneness with others, their affinity with nature, and their celebration of life.</p><p></p><p>The Filipino's charm lies in their smiles, in the numerous religious festivals that venerate nature, the Divine and the cycles of life and in the virtue of pakikipag-kapwa tao that treasures relationships, with friends and strangers alike. The concept of kapwa(others) is at the core of the Filipino soul. A Filipino scholar says of the Filipino: the joy of his being is in being with others.</p><p></p><p>The nation's charm is in the diversity in ways of life across the archipelago, the resplendent colors of its folk arts and the cacophony of foreign influences that have found roots in the Filipino languages, customs and traditions. </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>ḍ̴͙̲͕̓͆͂̅͠͝</p><p>̶̛̣̤̰̋̋͌̑̾͗͂͛͛̆̇̈̿̔̎͘̚͠ ̴̡̢̧̘̪̖̪̼͙̹̩̜͎̬͕̜̜͈̣̩͎̃̈́̌̇̈́̊̿̌̆̍͋̓̀̌̊̎̀̀̈͘͜͝</p><p>̵̛̫̞̥͉͉̱̰͈͑͋̀̓͐̆͆̆̂̾̑͒̽̇̃̒̚͘͝ ̵̡̨̢̝̠͓̗̠̯̼̲̩͎͍̺̖̘͍̲̮̖̈́̈́͊͜͝ ̶̡̧̛̮͇̞͈̖̜̫͈̼̬̼̥̩́͛̈́̃̐̈́́̀̓̍̏͊̅̆̏͊͗̊̒̚͘ ̴̢̡̡̦̘̥̣͕͔̰̦͈͉͉̥̼͈͎̻͔̗́̏̾̒̀́̽͂̉͋͗͒̀̆͐͊̈́̚͜͝͝ͅ</p><p≯̛̛̦̠̗͇͈̟̘̔̐͐̅̓̒͊̆̈̓͆̂̚̕͘͜ ̶̡̧̛̦̣̞̤̫͖͓̥̭͉̯̱̺̖͖̘͉̝̤̺͑͌̐̽͌̓͌̏̋̓͆͆̊́̉̇̆̈́̓̀̚̕͠</p><p≯̺͙͇̦̯̱͈̼̝̼̯̙̝͖̭̞͋̀̉͛͊̑̓̃͝ͅ ̵̢͇͎͉̦̗̠̰͖͙͎̰̾̌͆́̉̊̋͐̄͊̓͛̌͌̽̒̍̇̑̐̎̕͘̕͜</p><p>̵̥͈̤̬͙̱̹̂̋̉̔̏̂̈̌̐̈́́̐̿̽̅͆̋͝</p><p≯̧̡̧̛̪͚͔̻̮̣͍͇̬̬͚͓͎̼̪̓̓̇͛̀́̂̄̓́́̍́̇̿̊͗́͂͘̕͘̚</p><p>̷͔̦̹̜̠͕̩̱̼͑ ̸̢̪̖̤̪̣̙̥͚̟͓̣͓̮̹͉͉͇͕͋̓̂̓̿͂</p><p>̶̧̢̛̛̙͚͚̖͓̪͔̟̬͎̥̰̈́̈́̂̽̆̊̔̿̿̓̃̎͆͆̓̐̕͘͠͠ ̵͙̥̋͆̈́̉͛͆̓̀̄̌̄͊̾̌̈́͊̔̽͝͠</p><p>̶̡̘̞̳̩̣͇̒̿͂͂͌̅̎͒͝ͅ ̷̧̙̭̝̺͔̣̫̠̇͑̄̍̀́̉͋͑̊̐̀̉̆̊̕</p><p≯̨̝̦̙͈̬̹̮͇͎̬̠͎͓͕̘̖̥̜̘͚͌͐</p><p>̴̫̜͚̮̹̪̊̑̊̌̏̍̃͆͘͜͝ ̸̨̡̳̱̮̲̫̲̦͈̳̘̮̭̹̘͖̙̄͒̀̎̔̓̑͆̓͌̀͛̑̐́̋̈́̚͝͝</p><p>̶̨̢̥̺̠̗̥͎͔͖̼̙͍͇͉̃̉̐͊̈́́̍̕͝j̴̭͔͇̣̜̟̥̯̱͖̦̻̦̳̭̝̮̲̽̈̋͗j̵̡̧̤̠̗͇̙̦̥̠̣̀̐̂̈̀̂̑̄̂̊͑͠͝ͅd̷̟̒̌͋̌̈̑̒̐̏͆́͑̇̀͂͋̊͆̚͠j̴̨̡̧͙͕̠̗̙͈̩̼͍̙̪͖̭̞̠̺̪̥̲̤̎̈͌͋͋̾͆̂̎͆̓̿̉͘͝ş̷̨̢̛͙̯̹̠̺̦͓̻͈̬̪͓͑̈̽͒͛͜͝ͅ</p><p>ess </p><br />

One school of thought says it was a total failure while others opine that it was overall, good. I tend to side with the latter for various reasons.</p><p></p><p>First, while during the days leading to the SEA Games were faced with issues, such as the allegedly overpriced cauldron, the hotel mishaps of the visitors, the food issues and CR issues--these were proven to be at least partially false for the most part. There were explanations as to why these happened. </p><p></p><p>Second, the Philippines did its best to handle the big contingents taking into consideration many aspects of hosting, including food preferences on religious grounds. There were Halal food for our Muslim contestants. This would have shown foresight on the part of the committee. </p><p></p><p>Third, regarding the Games itself, we ended up with the most medals, maybe because of our home court advantage--but also hopefully because of our competent athletes. There are still of course many that are still lacking in how our government treats its athletes but this could be a good start to taking more care of our national pride. </p><p></p><p>Overall, with those three reasons alone, the SEA Games ended well for the Philippines.

                        <p></p><p>The increasing popularity of online gaming has been a major source of concern for parents, educators, and health care professionals. Many people have argued for banning online games, citing various reasons such as addictive behavior, cyberbullying, and inappropriate content. While there are valid arguments for banning online games, a complete ban is not necessary.</p><p></p><p>Addictive behavior is one of the biggest concerns regarding online gaming. People who play online games often become obsessed with the game and can lose track of time and neglect important responsibilities. This can lead to psychological issues such as depression and anxiety. While there are ways to mitigate these risks, such as setting time limits and monitoring game usage, banning online games completely is an extreme measure that is not necessary.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why people have argued for banning online games is cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a serious issue and can have serious consequences. Online gaming can provide an environment where bullies can harass other players without consequences. While this is a valid concern, there are ways to combat cyberbullying without a complete ban. For instance, game developers can implement strict policies regarding online conduct and can take action against those who violate these policies.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, many people have argued that online games contain inappropriate content. While some games do contain explicit content, this is not the case for all games. In fact, many online games are designed for children and are appropriate for all age groups. Therefore, a complete ban on online games is not necessary.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for banning online games, a complete ban is not necessary. Instead, game developers should take steps to mitigate the risks associated with online gaming, such as cyberbullying and addiction. Furthermore, parents should also be aware of the games their children are playing and ensure that they are age-appropriate. By taking these measures, online gaming can be enjoyed safely and responsibly.</p><br />

                            22. The symptoms brought by video games essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Video games are a popular form of entertainment enjoyed by millions of people around the world. With the rise of technology, video games have become more advanced and immersive, allowing players to experience virtual worlds and engage with others online. While video games can be a fun and engaging pastime, they can also have negative effects on our health if we are not careful. In this essay, we will explore the symptoms brought by video games and how they can impact our well-being. </p><p>One of the most common symptoms associated with video games is eye strain. This occurs when you stare at a screen for an extended period of time, causing your eyes to become tired and strained. Symptoms of eye strain can include dry eyes, headaches, and blurred vision. This is especially prevalent among gamers who spend hours playing games without taking breaks or resting their eyes. To prevent eye strain, it is recommended to take breaks every 20 minutes to look away from the screen and focus on something in the distance.</p><p>Another symptom brought by video games is poor posture. Gamers often sit in front of their screens for extended periods of time, leading to bad posture and potential back pain. This can be exacerbated by the use of chairs that do not provide adequate support, or by sitting in a cramped or uncomfortable position. It is important to take regular breaks and stretch to avoid these issues, and to invest in a comfortable chair that promotes good posture.</p><p>In addition to physical symptoms, video games can also have negative effects on our mental health. One symptom that is commonly associated with gaming is addiction. When playing games, it is easy to become immersed in the virtual world and lose track of time. This can lead to neglecting other responsibilities, such as school, work, or personal relationships. Addiction to video games can also cause mood swings, anxiety, and depression.</p><p>Another symptom brought by video games is aggression. Some games are designed to be violent and aggressive, and players can become desensitized to this behavior over time. This can lead to an increase in aggressive behavior, both online and offline. While not all gamers will experience this symptom, it is important to recognize the potential for violent games to impact our behavior.</p><p>Finally, video games can also have an impact on our sleep patterns. Many gamers will stay up late into the night playing games, leading to a lack of sleep and disrupted sleep patterns. This can cause fatigue, decreased productivity, and a range of physical and mental health issues. To avoid these symptoms, it is important to establish a healthy sleep routine and limit gaming to a reasonable amount of time each day.</p><p>In conclusion, video games can bring a range of symptoms that can impact our physical and mental well-being. These symptoms can include eye strain, poor posture, addiction, aggression, and disrupted sleep patterns. While not all gamers will experience these symptoms, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with gaming and take steps to protect our health. This can include taking regular breaks, investing in comfortable seating, setting limits on gaming time, and seeking professional help if necessary. By taking care of our bodies and minds, we can enjoy the benefits of gaming while minimizing the risks.</p>Video games can cause negative psychological effect such as self-control, anxiety, depression, aggressiveness and confusion. These effects could endanger the future of adolescence as they’re still part of the growth and development stage. The addictiveness of video games could further increase these negative benefits. Playing video games supports teenagers to do crimes as they are rewarded for doing so. For example, in Grand Theft Auto or GTA, the player is awarded for doing missions, missions which instructs the player to steal, to drive recklessly, to fight, to shoot and to kill. After a mission is accomplished, they would get rewards such as points, or more health, or a more violent option such as a weapon like a gun or a tank.<br /><br />If you see a violent video game player assault another person, it is difficult to know the direct cause of the assault. Was it playing violent video games for hours on end, or was it something else? The psychological process by which playing violent video games produces this result is not as intuitive to most people as are biological processes. People are probably more accepting of the idea that smoking causes lung cancer, for example, because it is much easier to grasp the idea that smoke going into the lungs, damages cells, and starts tumour growth. According to Brad bushman, a communications and psychology professor at Ohio State University, the link between video games and the aggressive behaviour is clear: “Over 130 studies have been conducted on over 130,000 participants around the world.” Bushman said that these studies proves that violent video games can lead to an increase in aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, including increased heart rate.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Take a look at today's generation. A student comes home from school at around three or four o'clock in the afternoon, sets his bag aside, debates whether he should take a shower, definitely eats his lunch, and begins his after school program: playing video games, playing video games, and playing more video games. Video games, unfortunately, have become an imperative part of the average teenager's life. Whether it's hours, day, or maybe even weeks, teenagers spend an excessive amount of time slaying monsters, killing zombies, or just shooting at each other's avatars for all time's sake. They lose track of time, deprive themselves of sleep, miss out on their homework, and deteriorate their health, all for the sake of the phenomenal world of 'Call of Duty' and fellow video games. A vast majority of the global population believes that playing video games can positively influence the lives of those who favor them, while others strongly disagree. Although playing video games may help stimulate and relax the brain, it is still considered detrimental because of the tendency to reward violence and create the ultimate aggressive player.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
