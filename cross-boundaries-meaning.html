                                            what is this poem all about? SHAMAN (for the Sukdan of Inabanga) By: Dr. Ulysses B. Aparece We both believe in this: place As either timed or timeless. A constant watchman though I am, I still dare cross the far boundaries In search of the other side of space. Gatherer of leaves, root, stones, you are The keeper of the ancient craft of touch Extending welcome to a new realm Where begins the travel of remembering. So I gain entrance to this great beyond, I must admit I carry a baggage for you To unburden, these fruits of my living. You thus begin your shaman’s journey On my body, a vast geography of frightened Muscles, bones, nerves, joints, veins. Your hands whisper the secrets of gabun, Kulavu, tanglad, kugang-kugan…. Green residences of gentle duwendes. Skill of hands untangles invisible knots In my stomach, quieting down murmurs Of the heart; yours is a sweet gurgle Of rivulets, breath of earth and forest: Mutya sa Kuampang, mutya sa Panghagban Mutya sa Matinlig, mutya sa Puwawan… Strange prayer that never really matters. The means is the message, a message, Until your crystals proclaim this portent: The world I left in one certain moment Has followed me with much vengeance, Now shakes your space from fossilized sleep. O great healer of fear—medicine man, Tambalan, oracionan, baylan, sukdan— What has happened to your knowing hands, Can’t they resist with open palms these Beastly creatures, maps of hardest structures? Where are your spirit familiars? Your canticles from the sanctuary called heart Cannot outlast the monster’s roars lording Over bleeding shrubberies, drowning Your place’s whispers, breezes sighs. How, in the end, you have become Your own province, of silence: red rivulets, Purple boundaries, capital wound. Mine, now, is the knowing touch of duty, Filling the void, wishing to connect, Sending you off, never letting go.​</a>

                            4. what is this poem all about? SHAMAN (for the Sukdan of Inabanga) By: Dr. Ulysses B. Aparece We both believe in this: place As either timed or timeless. A constant watchman though I am, I still dare cross the far boundaries In search of the other side of space. Gatherer of leaves, root, stones, you are The keeper of the ancient craft of touch Extending welcome to a new realm Where begins the travel of remembering. So I gain entrance to this great beyond, I must admit I carry a baggage for you To unburden, these fruits of my living. You thus begin your shaman’s journey On my body, a vast geography of frightened Muscles, bones, nerves, joints, veins. Your hands whisper the secrets of gabun, Kulavu, tanglad, kugang-kugan…. Green residences of gentle duwendes. Skill of hands untangles invisible knots In my stomach, quieting down murmurs Of the heart; yours is a sweet gurgle Of rivulets, breath of earth and forest: Mutya sa Kuampang, mutya sa Panghagban Mutya sa Matinlig, mutya sa Puwawan… Strange prayer that never really matters. The means is the message, a message, Until your crystals proclaim this portent: The world I left in one certain moment Has followed me with much vengeance, Now shakes your space from fossilized sleep. O great healer of fear—medicine man, Tambalan, oracionan, baylan, sukdan— What has happened to your knowing hands, Can’t they resist with open palms these Beastly creatures, maps of hardest structures? Where are your spirit familiars? Your canticles from the sanctuary called heart Cannot outlast the monster’s roars lording Over bleeding shrubberies, drowning Your place’s whispers, breezes sighs. How, in the end, you have become Your own province, of silence: red rivulets, Purple boundaries, capital wound. Mine, now, is the knowing touch of duty, Filling the void, wishing to connect, Sending you off, never letting go.​</h2><br />
