Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                                            BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</a>

Try to DEDUCE andformulate its Research topic.Massachusetts provides good opportunities for historic population research, sinceregistration of births, deaths, and marriages was made compulsory in 1639 (Spiegelman,1968:3). Deerfield was selected as the community for study after a number of small towns inNorthwestern Massachusetts were considered. The reason Deerfield was chosen is becauseavailable records appeared to be very complete. The community of Deerfield's ownemphasis on its long history, and efforts by such specific groups as the Pocumtuck ValleyMemorial Asaociation, (founded in 1870), and the Heritage Foundation, provide for a goodlibrary with many well preserved records. Although several references concerning Deerfieldand Massachusetts are consulted, the major sources for the information presented beloware Baldwin's Vital Records of Deerfield, Massachusetts to the Year 1850 (1920); andGeorge Sheldon's History of Deerfield (1896). The major emphasis on the complete recordsgiven in Baldwin 2 (1920) with supplementary information being added from Sheldon'spublished genealogies (pp. 4-407, Vol. II). Sheldon's work is considered by many colonialhistorians to be a very well written and thorough local history. The vital statistics compiled byBaldwin appear to be very complete considering the time period covered and are based ongrave inscriptions as well as town and parish records. These statistics include 4943 births,1485 marriages, and 2204 deaths. In an effort to test the accuracy of the records, the localcemeteries around Deerfield were sample surveyed, and virtually 100 percent of thecemetery markers checked are found in Baldwin.Independent Assessment 1 /Direction: Identify the DATA used in the previous paragraph that was used to describe thebackground of the research.

A sample of 2,000 was sought to estimate the average achievement in science offifth graders in a city's public schools. The average 5th grade enrollment in the city's elementary schools is 100students. Thus, 20 schools were randomly selected and within each of those schools all fifth graders were tested._________2. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups inmates by thetype of crime committed, determines the percentage of the total in each crime category, and uses that percentageto determine the number of inmates randomly selected from each group._________3. A researcher has a population of 100 third grade children from a local school districtfrom which a sample of 25 children is to be selected. Each child's name is put on a list, and each child isassigned a number from 1 to 100. Then the numbers 1 to 100 are written on separate pieces of paper andshuffled. Finally, the researcher picks 25 slips of paper and the numbers on the paper determine the 25participants.___________4. A sociologist conducts an opinion survey in a major city. Part of the research plancalls for describing and comparing the opinions of four different ethnic groups: African Americans, AsianAmericans, European Americans, and Native Americans. For a total sample of 300, the researcher selects 75participants from each of the four predetermined subgroups.________5. A researcher is interested in political attitudes of individuals within a particularstate. The researcher uses the following procedure to obtain a sample: (a) a random sample of counties is drawn,(b) within the counties selected, districts are randomly drawn, () within each district, blocks are randomlysampled, (d) within blocks selected, building are randomly drawn, and (d) all residents within the buildingsselected comprise the sample._________6. Instructors teaching research methods are interested in knowing what studytechniques their students are utilizing. Rather than assessing all students, the researchers randomly select 10students from each of the sections to comprise their sample.__________7. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups maximum-security prisons by state, randomly selects 10 states, and, from those 10, selects three prisons. She includes allthe inmates in those three prisons in her sample.__________8. Say you wanted to survey professors at KSU about their publication records. Youwant to be sure to include professors from each department, even the very small ones.____________9.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The issue of gender equality in employment has given rise to numerous policies in advanced industrial countries, all aimed at tackling gender discrimination regarding recruitment, salary and promotion. Yet gender inequalities in the workplace persist. The purpose of this research is to document the psychosocial process involved in the persistence of gender discrimination against working women. Drawing on the literature on the justification of discrimination, we hypothesized that the myths according to which women’s work threatens children and family life mediates the relationship between sexism and opposition to a mother’s career. We tested this hypothesis using the Family and Changing Gender Roles module of the International Social Survey Programme. The dataset contained data collected in 1994 and 2012 from 51632 respondents from 18 countries. Structural equation modellings confirmed the hypothesised mediation. Overall, the findings shed light on how motherhood myths justify the gender structure in countries promoting gender equality.</p><br />

In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                            19. BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</h2><br />

The community of Deerfield's ownemphasis on its long history, and efforts by such specific groups as the Pocumtuck ValleyMemorial Asaociation, (founded in 1870), and the Heritage Foundation, provide for a goodlibrary with many well preserved records. Although several references concerning Deerfieldand Massachusetts are consulted, the major sources for the information presented beloware Baldwin's Vital Records of Deerfield, Massachusetts to the Year 1850 (1920); andGeorge Sheldon's History of Deerfield (1896). The major emphasis on the complete recordsgiven in Baldwin 2 (1920) with supplementary information being added from Sheldon'spublished genealogies (pp. 4-407, Vol. II). Sheldon's work is considered by many colonialhistorians to be a very well written and thorough local history. The vital statistics compiled byBaldwin appear to be very complete considering the time period covered and are based ongrave inscriptions as well as town and parish records. These statistics include 4943 births,1485 marriages, and 2204 deaths. In an effort to test the accuracy of the records, the localcemeteries around Deerfield were sample surveyed, and virtually 100 percent of thecemetery markers checked are found in Baldwin.Independent Assessment 1 /Direction: Identify the DATA used in the previous paragraph that was used to describe thebackground of the research.

                            24. ACTIVITY 3: SAMPLING TECHNIQUEIn each of the following examples, identify the SPECIFIC sampling method/technique being used.________ 1. A sample of 2,000 was sought to estimate the average achievement in science offifth graders in a city's public schools. The average 5th grade enrollment in the city's elementary schools is 100students. Thus, 20 schools were randomly selected and within each of those schools all fifth graders were tested._________2. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups inmates by thetype of crime committed, determines the percentage of the total in each crime category, and uses that percentageto determine the number of inmates randomly selected from each group._________3. A researcher has a population of 100 third grade children from a local school districtfrom which a sample of 25 children is to be selected. Each child's name is put on a list, and each child isassigned a number from 1 to 100. Then the numbers 1 to 100 are written on separate pieces of paper andshuffled. Finally, the researcher picks 25 slips of paper and the numbers on the paper determine the 25participants.___________4. A sociologist conducts an opinion survey in a major city. Part of the research plancalls for describing and comparing the opinions of four different ethnic groups: African Americans, AsianAmericans, European Americans, and Native Americans. For a total sample of 300, the researcher selects 75participants from each of the four predetermined subgroups.________5. A researcher is interested in political attitudes of individuals within a particularstate. The researcher uses the following procedure to obtain a sample: (a) a random sample of counties is drawn,(b) within the counties selected, districts are randomly drawn, () within each district, blocks are randomlysampled, (d) within blocks selected, building are randomly drawn, and (d) all residents within the buildingsselected comprise the sample._________6. Instructors teaching research methods are interested in knowing what studytechniques their students are utilizing. Rather than assessing all students, the researchers randomly select 10students from each of the sections to comprise their sample.__________7. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups maximum-security prisons by state, randomly selects 10 states, and, from those 10, selects three prisons. She includes allthe inmates in those three prisons in her sample.__________8. Say you wanted to survey professors at KSU about their publication records. Youwant to be sure to include professors from each department, even the very small ones.____________9. Say you want to study the participants who attended a certain activity or event, whatsampling technique will you use?___________10. Say you were interested in sampling students who deal drugs on campus. Whatsampling technique could you use to build this sample?​</h2><br />
