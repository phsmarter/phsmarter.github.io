                            1. how do their parents feel about the story of romeo and juliet​</h2><br />

                            2. discuss the relationships between parents and children in romeo and juliet.how do romeo and juliet interact with their parents?are they rebelious ,in the modern sense?explain your answer.how do their parents feel about them?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Juliet is the fourteen year old daughter of the Capulet household. She is an only daughter and would be thought to be doted on, yet her closest guardian is her wet nurse.
</p><p>
</p><p>Her nurse has been there since childhood when her mother was absent at ‘Mantra’. Juliet’s ‘sweet nurse’ dotes on her by calling her ‘lamb’ and ‘ladybird’, this informal language signifies a close relationship being portrayed near to the beginning of the play.
</p><p>
</p><p>   However, Act 1. Scene 3 illustrated a lack of love between Juliet and her mother, which is revealed when Juliet greets her mother by calling her ‘Madame’ and bowing at her presence in the 1977 film directed by Zefferelli. There is a great lack of communication that is exaggerated in the 1998 film directed by Baz Luhrman where Juliet’s mother seems lost and bewildered when put face to face with her daughter and has to prompt the nurse to ‘come back’ into the room. This shows the audience their hostile relationship.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is already showing that the nurse appears far more motherly to Juliet than Lady Capulet. Lady Capulet continues to ‘speak briefly’ and questions Juliet about the possibility of love for Paris, a man she has not met. In the sixteenth century marriage played a strong part in a young ‘girl’s’ life, whether she had meet the man or not, if it was a suitable match she would be wedded to keep her families status high and marry into money.
</p><p>
</p><p>   Lady Capulet shows a lack of knowledge and a weak relationship with her daughter while talking of love. This indicates that Lady Capulet has never built up a bond with her daughter, instead Juliet has grown fond of her ‘sweet nurse’.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, Capulet fears for his ‘child’s’ young age and knows of the ‘sheltered life’ he has given her and seems not to want her to hurrying into pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>   Their relationship is shown in Act 3. Scene 5, in the 1977 Zefferelli film, When Juliet hides behind the nurse while in a ‘quarrel’ with her father. Zefferelli has used strong body language to determine the different relationship Capulet family.
</p><p>
</p><p>In Act3. Scene 5, Capulet contradicts himself by ordering Juliet to marry Paris, whilst in Atc1 he tells Paris to wait because his ‘child is yet a stranger in the world’. This could be because of Tybalt’s abrupt death, causing the younger generation of the empire to decrease. Capulet is portrayed to be the leading role of the family is this scene. This is shown in the Zefferelli directed film, when Capulet hots Lady Capulet when she tells him that he is being irrational. The nurse also tries to calm Capulet, and when fails she takes sides with Capulet. Juliet becomes angry, betrayed and feels that she has no hope but to die.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, Capulet still does not relent to Juliet’s incessant explanation of her ‘hate’ for marriage to Paris.
</p><p>
</p><p>   In Act 4. Scene 5, Capulet seems hasty towards his ‘child’s’ death. His language is calm and well structured. He uses descriptions of her ‘blood’ being ‘settled’ and relating her death to ‘night’. This seems more like a verse from one of Romeo’s sonnets than someone who’s lost his only daughter.
</p><p>
</p><p>Capulet, while morning for his daughter’s death, he seems just as disappointed that Juliet has missed her marriage and rhetorically asks why the ‘murder’ of ‘our solemnity’ had to happen. Lady Capulet shows true disappear  for her daughter’s death by repeating, ‘she’s dead’ as if she cannot take the reality in. Her hurried and simplistic language portrays a troubled and caring mother, the opposite to Lord Capulet’s emotions for the death of his daughter.
</p><p>
</p><p>    Romeo’s relationship with his own parents have mixed similarities to the relationship Juliet shares with her parents.
</p><p>
</p><p>    Shakespeare portrays Romeo’s parents as being scared of having a parental relationship with Romeo. Neither of them know how to approach him as they are fearful of being rejected by their emotional son. They worry for Romeo and ’pray’ he isn’t at any of the ‘frays’, which keep the two families at conflict with each other.  This portrays a concern and a sense of parental care for Romeo, yet they do not know whether he was at the fray or not… making the reader think that Romeo and his parents do not spend a great deal of time together. They only know that Romeo has been seen with ‘tears’ or has ‘locked’ himself in his room which is a common sign for a teenager in love. Yet his parents do not acknowledge that this is the case. Lord and Lady Montague do not pursue the affair of their troubled son, but leave it in the hands of Romeo’s good cousin Benvolio, who is determined to know of his ‘grievance’.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Romeo and Juliet is a play about the conflict between the main characters’ love, with its transformative power, and the darkness, hatred, and selfishness represented by their families’ feud. The two teenaged lovers, Romeo and Juliet, fall in love the first time they see each other, but their families’ feud requires they remain enemies. Over the course of the play the lovers’ powerful desires directly clash with their families’ equally powerful hatred of each other. Initially, we may expect that the lovers will prove the unifying force that unites the families. Were the play a comedy, the families would see the light of reason and resolve their feud, Romeo and Juliet would have a public wedding, and everyone would live happily ever after. But the Montague-Capulet feud is too powerful for the lovers to overcome. The world of the play is an imperfect place, where freedom from everything except pure love is an unrealistic goal. Ultimately, the characters love does resolve the feud, but at the price of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Romeo and Juliet begin the play trapped by their social roles. Romeo is a young man who is expected to chase women, but he has chosen Rosaline, who has sworn to remain a virgin. The way Romeo speaks about Rosaline suggests he is playing a role rather than feeling true, overpowering emotion. He expresses his frustration in clichés that make his cousin Benvolio laugh at him. Romeo is also expected to be excited by the feud with the Capulets, but Romeo finds the feud as miserable as his love: “O brawling love, O loving hate” (1.1.). When we meet Juliet she is in her bedroom, physically trapped between her Nurse and her mother. As a young woman her role is to obediently wait for her parents to marry her to someone. When her mother announces that Paris will be Juliet’s future husband, Juliet’s response is obedient, but unenthusiastic: “I’ll look to like, if looking liking move.” (1.3). These early scenes reveal Romeo and Juliet’s characters, and introduce the themes of love, sex, and marriage that dominate the remainder of the play.</p><p></p><p>The incident which sets the plot in motion is Romeo’s decision to attend the Capulets’ party. This decision is Romeo’s first attempt to free himself from the role that confines him. Benvolio has advised him to get over Rosaline by checking out other women. By going to the Capulets’ home, Romeo is also temporarily ignoring his social role as a Montague who must feud with the Capulets. Unfortunately, Tybalt sees Romeo’s presence as an “intrusion” and swears revenge: “this intrusion shall, / Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt’rest gall” (1.5.). Tybalt’s anger raises the stakes for Romeo’s presence at the party, and foreshadows their eventual duel. In the very next line after Tybalt’s exit, Romeo and Juliet meet. Now Romeo has equally high stakes for staying at the party as for leaving. If he stays he risks Tybalt’s further wrath, but if he leaves, he won’t get to spend more time with Juliet. He risks his life for love, establishing the high stakes of the lovers’ relationship. When Romeo and Juliet talk, they reinforce the extraordinariness of their new love by using the religious language of “pilgrims,” “saints,” and “prayers,” suggesting their love will escapes earthly limitations.</p><br />

                            5. how do the characters manifest the feud in romeo and juliet​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In "Romeo and Juliet," the feud between the Capulet and Montague families manifests itself in various ways through the characters. Here are a few examples:</p><p></p><p>1.Romeo and Juliet: The main characters, Romeo and Juliet, belong to the feuding families. Their love is forbidden because of the feud, and their tragic end is a result of their families' hatred for each other.</p><p></p><p>2.Tybalt: Tybalt, a cousin of Juliet, is hot-headed and easily provoked. He is fiercely loyal to his family and takes any perceived slight against them as a personal insult. He instigates several conflicts with Romeo and his friends, ultimately leading to his own death and Romeo's exile.</p><p></p><p>3.Mercutio: Mercutio is a friend of Romeo's who is not directly involved in the feud but is deeply affected by it. He is killed by Tybalt in a fit of rage, and his death sets off a chain of events that leads to the tragic end of Romeo and Juliet.</p><p></p><p>4.Lord Capulet and Lord Montague: The heads of the two families are deeply entrenched in the feud and refuse to put their differences aside. They are unwilling to forgive or forget past grievances, and their stubbornness contributes to the tragic outcome of the play.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the characters in "Romeo and Juliet" are shaped by the feud between the Capulet and Montague families, and their actions and decisions are often motivated by a desire to defend their family's honor or seek revenge for past wrongs.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I think Shakespeare wants the audience to believe this is love at first sight.

                        Their youthfulness may explain some of their hasty decision-making. They were married, secretly. So Romeo loves Juliet veeeery much that he killed himself just to be with her.<br />

parents? </h2><br />
                        Romeo and Juliet really has a different ways when they interact with their Parents. For Juliet, it is so easy for her to approach her Parents, because they loved her so much, but they were strict and forced Juliet to marry someone that she never loved. For Romeo, he had a bit problems concerning his family, due to having many enemies, they were treated badly; and Romeo find himself always in a fight. Romeo and Juliet are young and somewhat reliant on their parents. While the Capulets and the Montagues care for their children, this does not translate to good parenting throughout the play.The nature of their relationship was often strained and distrustful, as shown in Capulet's violent tirade when Juliet refuses to marry Paris.There is a lack of communication between R+J and their parents, especially Juliet, which is evident in the scene where Lady Capulet relies on the Nurse for guidance.<br /><br />
