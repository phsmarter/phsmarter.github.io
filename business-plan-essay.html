Minute Burger is a fast food chain that sells a range of burgers and also beverages. They have franchises all over the country.

Minute Burger is common along students who are living on a college budget and their target audience are the young people.</p><p></p><p>One of their strategic way of marketing their products online is the <strong>use of the resources that are available online</strong>-specifically from their fans. Fans tend to send their <strong>artworks or "Fan Art"</strong> to minute burger about different well known characters or anime in relation to their product. Because of that, <strong>Minute Burger has taken the idea of including different animes that are trending.</strong> They did that because young people are more likely to purchase the product if there's something that is of their interest. When Minute Burger released this ad featuring Kakyoin from Jojo's Bizarre Adventures-my favorite anime, that gave me a laugh and a thought to consider buying a burger. <strong>That way of marketing, specifically focusing on one demographic, can greatly help in reaching out your business to more potential costumers. </strong></p><br />
