                                            One of the things I like best about school is my art class. We have a great teacher named Mrs. Hilbert. She is a wonderful artist. I love to watch her draw and paint. She teaches us how to mix paint to make just right colors for our paintings. She plays good music while we draw and paint. We draw and paint almost everyday in class. Some other days we look at pictures of other artists. It is interesting to do this. It helps me to think of things that I want to paint or draw. In fact, we have an art exhibit in December this year. Our works will be in one of the banks in our town. We are inviting people from the community to our exhibit. Our parents are also invited to go with us. I have three paintings I am still working on now. I hope one of them will be chosen to be in the exhibit. I like having a goal to work towardwhat type of text is presented?​</a>

                                            I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war? In times of peace? 7-10. Make believe that you are one of the following: (a. teacher b. policeman c. doctor d. businessman) How can you show that you are a true Filipino in terms of solving community and national problems? ​</a>

                                            Narl had struggled in gym all semester. It wasn’t his fault. He just wasn’t athletic, was all. He didn’t see what was so great about sports anyway. Why should he be expected to be good at sports, just because his father had been? And what did it mean to “participate”, and why did his gym teacher think he wasn’t doing it? He always puts on his uniform. He wore the proper shoes. He ran around when everyone else was running around. If he really didn’t understand what he was running around for, wasn’t that the teacher’s fault? All the way home, Narl considered his options. He could sign the report card himself. He could point out that he had gotten A’s in all of his academic subjects. He could write his father a poem about the absurdity of trying to measure and grade athletic ability... that was a laugh. Like his father would appreciate a poem! No, there was nothing he could say that was going to make this okay. What was it his father had told him when interims had come out? A boy who failed gym was destined to fail at life. There was nothing else for him to do. There was no way he could take this report card home. The time had come to take drastic measures. He’d been saving his birthday money for years, for just such a desperate situation. ____7. Narl and his father are much alike, and they understand each other well. ____8. Narl recognizes that there are many things he does well including athletics. ____9. Narl’s father is intolerant, unaccepting, and demanding. ____10. Narl plans to run away from home.​</a>

                        1.) The one that encouraged me to learn more is not the high grades nor fame, it is because I want to know more about something. I want to know the things that I have to know, especially at my age, it's like reaching beyond my limit because this also benefits me in the future.<br /><br />2.) Every teacher is a great teacher because they are the one who build us, they are the one who helps us develop our understanding, knowledge and personality.It doesn't that your teacher is strict he/she is not a great one because what makes a good teacher is not about the way he/she teaches us it's about how he/she feeds us with knowledge and learning he/she wants to share with us.<br />

                            10. One of the things I like best about school is my art class. We have a great teacher named Mrs. Hilbert. She is a wonderful artist. I love to watch her draw and paint. She teaches us how to mix paint to make just right colors for our paintings. She plays good music while we draw and paint. We draw and paint almost everyday in class. Some other days we look at pictures of other artists. It is interesting to do this. It helps me to think of things that I want to paint or draw. In fact, we have an art exhibit in December this year. Our works will be in one of the banks in our town. We are inviting people from the community to our exhibit. Our parents are also invited to go with us. I have three paintings I am still working on now. I hope one of them will be chosen to be in the exhibit. I like having a goal to work towardwhat type of text is presented?​</h2><br />

                            26. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?

                            29. Narl had struggled in gym all semester. It wasn’t his fault. He just wasn’t athletic, was all. He didn’t see what was so great about sports anyway. Why should he be expected to be good at sports, just because his father had been? And what did it mean to “participate”, and why did his gym teacher think he wasn’t doing it? He always puts on his uniform. He wore the proper shoes. He ran around when everyone else was running around. If he really didn’t understand what he was running around for, wasn’t that the teacher’s fault? All the way home, Narl considered his options. He could sign the report card himself. He could point out that he had gotten A’s in all of his academic subjects. He could write his father a poem about the absurdity of trying to measure and grade athletic ability... that was a laugh. Like his father would appreciate a poem! No, there was nothing he could say that was going to make this okay. What was it his father had told him when interims had come out? A boy who failed gym was destined to fail at life. There was nothing else for him to do. There was no way he could take this report card home. The time had come to take drastic measures. He’d been saving his birthday money for years, for just such a desperate situation. ____7. Narl and his father are much alike, and they understand each other well. ____8. Narl recognizes that there are many things he does well including athletics. ____9. Narl’s father is intolerant, unaccepting, and demanding. ____10. Narl plans to run away from home.​</h2><br />
