                    <p>Activity 3.3: Looking into Different Parts of a Descriptive Essay A. Introduction The introduction is an important part of an essay. For a descriptive essay, it always needs to describe. It is one paragraph long (three to five sentences). It needs to let the reader know what you are trying to write about. It also needs to begin in a way that will make the reader want to go on and find out what happens. It could: 1. Tell the time and place you are writing about - set the scene. For example: It was a cold, grey day in December; only three weeks away from New Year. 2. Create an atmosphere. For example: The road outside was hustling and bustling with Christmas shoppers. 3. Surprise the reader. For example: Who was creating the chaos in the street?​</p>

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                                            English 10 Quarter 3 – Module 3Informative text is a kind of text that offers data, definitions, and descriptions of phenomena or details about a fact. It introduces a clearly stated topic and creates an organizational structure in which related information is grouped logically to support the purpose of writing. It develops evidence with relevant facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, and examples with references. It also uses appropriate linking ideas within and across paragraphs to smoothly and purposefully connect the controlling idea to evidence and provides a satisfying conclusion related to the topic.WHAT’S INArticles, textbook chapters, passages, paragraphs or sentences have topics and main ideas. Locating the topic, main idea, and supporting details is important in helping you understand what the writer is attempting to express. Moreover, identifying the relationship between these will also increase your comprehension.In writing an informative essay, you have to keep in mind that the main idea is the point of the paragraph and it is the most important thought about the topic. The main idea is usually a sentence and it can be in different places within a paragraph.Here’s a sample paragraph and let’s try your skill in finding the main idea. Try to locate the topic first, and then look for the main idea.Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job shadow” in which you spend a day with a person who is working in the field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.The topic is _______________________________________________________. The main idea is __________________________________________________.​</a>

NARRATIVE TEXT Purpose: Essentially, the purpose of narrative text is to tell a story. That said, there can be many reasons for story telling in the first place, for example, myths can be told to explain natural phenomena and legends can be used to pass on cultural beliefs. Storytelling itself is a means to entertain and inform readers and allows for the writer to express themselves creatively and imaginatively. There are many types of narrative text, including myths, fables, traditional tales, novels, short stories etc. 2. EXPLANATORY TEXT Purpose: It moves beyond providing straightforward descriptions to looking at things like causes and reasons. They move beyond a retelling of what happened such as in a simple report, to address the why and how of what happened. 3. EXPOSITORY TEXT Purpose: It exists to provide facts in a way that is educational and purposeful.The text is fact-based with the purpose of exposing the truth through a reliable source. It focuses on educating its reader. Its purpose is not primarily to amuse, but to enlighten and instruct. The objective is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. 4. Factual/Personal Recount Purpose: Recounts focus on retelling events and are generally intended to inform and/or entertain. 5. Persuasive Text Purpose: Its purpose is to convince the reader of the merits of adopting a particular viewpoint or taking a specific course of action ​</a>

For a descriptive essay, it always needs to describe. It is one paragraph long (three to five sentences). It needs to let the reader know what you are trying to write about. It also needs to begin in a way that will make the reader want to go on and find out what happens. It could: 1. Tell the time and place you are writing about - set the scene. For example: It was a cold, grey day in December; only three weeks away from New Year. 2. Create an atmosphere. For example: The road outside was hustling and bustling with Christmas shoppers. 3. Surprise the reader. For example: Who was creating the chaos in the street?​</h2><br />

Against any opponent but a careful entomologist with a cardboard box, the mantis is a lethal hunter and master of camouflage. Its four front legs, head and thorax are covered in delicate structures resembling colorful flower petals. In appearance, it looks like nothing so much as a praying mantis covered in beautiful painted fans.</p><p>As for its behavior, like any good mantis, it is an ambush predator. It takes full advantage of its unique appearance, settling amongst the petals of orchids and awaiting visiting insects. It favors butterflies and moths for its meals, but will happily take any insect on offer. Indeed, it need not even be an insect: particularly voracious orchid mantises have been known to feed on small lizards, frogs, mice and even birds.</p><p>Its behavior among its own kind is no different. Like many mantises, orchid mantises are opportunistic cannibals. They don't go out of their way to devour their own kind, but should one stray into striking range of another when it's feeling peckish, it may well become a meal.coronatus is not recorded as performing the praying mantis's infamous reproductive cannibalism, however.</p><p>Its relationship to humans is neutral, verging on positive. H. coronatus is not an ally of the committed gardener like the aphid-devouring ladybug, but it will nibble on any pests that present themselves. Aside from that, the orchid mantis is only valuable to humans for its extraordinary beauty.</p><p></p><p>Hymenopus coronatus is an example of a unique form of beauty that exists only in nature, careless of human judgment, designed for function rather than form, but still capable of making an observer catch their breath at its strange loveliness.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ps:</strong><strong> </strong>Siguro ibahin mo na lang ng konti </p><br />

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!"

He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                            10. English 10 Quarter 3 – Module 3Informative text is a kind of text that offers data, definitions, and descriptions of phenomena or details about a fact. It introduces a clearly stated topic and creates an organizational structure in which related information is grouped logically to support the purpose of writing. It develops evidence with relevant facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, and examples with references. It also uses appropriate linking ideas within and across paragraphs to smoothly and purposefully connect the controlling idea to evidence and provides a satisfying conclusion related to the topic.WHAT’S INArticles, textbook chapters, passages, paragraphs or sentences have topics and main ideas. Locating the topic, main idea, and supporting details is important in helping you understand what the writer is attempting to express. Moreover, identifying the relationship between these will also increase your comprehension.In writing an informative essay, you have to keep in mind that the main idea is the point of the paragraph and it is the most important thought about the topic. The main idea is usually a sentence and it can be in different places within a paragraph.Here’s a sample paragraph and let’s try your skill in finding the main idea. Try to locate the topic first, and then look for the main idea.Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job shadow” in which you spend a day with a person who is working in the field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.The topic is _______________________________________________________. The main idea is __________________________________________________.​</h2><br />

NARRATIVE TEXT Purpose: Essentially, the purpose of narrative text is to tell a story. That said, there can be many reasons for story telling in the first place, for example, myths can be told to explain natural phenomena and legends can be used to pass on cultural beliefs. Storytelling itself is a means to entertain and inform readers and allows for the writer to express themselves creatively and imaginatively. There are many types of narrative text, including myths, fables, traditional tales, novels, short stories etc. 2. EXPLANATORY TEXT Purpose: It moves beyond providing straightforward descriptions to looking at things like causes and reasons. They move beyond a retelling of what happened such as in a simple report, to address the why and how of what happened. 3. EXPOSITORY TEXT Purpose: It exists to provide facts in a way that is educational and purposeful.The text is fact-based with the purpose of exposing the truth through a reliable source. It focuses on educating its reader. Its purpose is not primarily to amuse, but to enlighten and instruct. The objective is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. 4. Factual/Personal Recount Purpose: Recounts focus on retelling events and are generally intended to inform and/or entertain. 5. Persuasive Text Purpose: Its purpose is to convince the reader of the merits of adopting a particular viewpoint or taking a specific course of action ​</h2><br />
