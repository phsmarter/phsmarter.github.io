How to write a literature review: . â€¢ . 1. Enumerate 2. Describe 3. Summarize objectively 4. Evaluate 5. Clarify the previous research. It should give a theoretical base for the research and help you (the author) determine the nature of your research. The literature review acknowledges the work of previous researchers and, in so doing, assures the reader that your work has been well conceived. A literature review must do these things: 1. be organized around and related directly to the thesis or research question you are developing 2. synthesize results into a summary of what is and is not known writing/literature-review) (https://guides.library.bloomu.edu/litreview) Read a portion of a literature review below: According to the study of Guevarra et al. (2007) on the Assessment of Disaster Preparedness in selected public schools in Luzon, of the 37 schools covered in the study, most (59%) of them came from the national capital region, and most of them are elementary schools. Thirty-five schools (95%) are reported to have formed disaster committees. 6) of the respondent However, less than one-third (30%) of schools have disaster preparedness plans. 3. identify areas of controversy in the literature 4. formulate questions that need further research (http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/specific-types-of-good. Another study by Kano et al. (2007) in Los Angeles includes three public school districts conducted through self-administered questionnaires on emergency preparedness. The result reveals that most respondents feel safe in their schools towards disasters. However, the survey reveals a need to improve the schools' written disaster plans, training on how to respond during emergencies, procurement of equipment and supplies to be used during emergencies, and the practice of a Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS). The study by Ozmen (2006) in Turkey on the aspects of the principals of the schools regarding the school's level of preparedness reveals that the schools are not ready since their level of preparedness is not This means that the school principals do not attain the high level of preparedness for an earthquake.
