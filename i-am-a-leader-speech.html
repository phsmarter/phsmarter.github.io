In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul and the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos. I am, therefore, happy to know of the integration of the Filipino youth and that the Filipino youth is now on the march. The question is: Where is it going? Is it marching with irresistible will and determination toward progress and civilization, peace and order, and the prosperity and happiness of the Fatherland? If it is, I, as the chosen head of our nation and our people, heartily welcome it and bid it Godspeed.
It is trite saying that the future belongs to youth, especially to those dynamic, aggressive and self-confident young men and women who have foresight. Thus, they have the bounden duty to ensure it. So much faith the greatest Filipino patriot and hero, Rizal, had in the youth of the land that while he was still in his teens, he dedicated to it his prize winning poem entitled “To the Filipino Youth,” and he called the Filipino youth not without reason and justification “Fair hope of my Fatherland.”
Several years later, when Rizal was in Madrid, he thought again of the Filipino youth. On the occasion of the signal honor and distinction conferred upon the famous Filipino painter Juan Luna when one of his paintings was awarded the highest prize in the artistic world, Rizal offered a touching toast. He expressed the fervent hope that the worthy and commendable examples of Juan Luna, and Resurrection, another famed Filipino painter, will be imitated or emulated by the Filipino youth. In the course of a few years that youth had become to him more than the “fair hope of my fatherland”; it had become the “sacred hope of my Fatherland.”
Rizal’s fair and sacred hope is represented by the young men and women of today, by you, the Filipino youth on the march, you who will be either the leaders and masters of your country and your country’s fate tomorrow or the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people more ambitious and far-seeing than you, men with vision, with courage, and with an indomitable will to succeed whatever be the obstacles.
Inspired by the same noble sentiment, the late Dr. Rafael Palma, builder of the University of the Philippines, dedicated to the same youth, to the same “fair and sacred hope” of the Fatherland, his last work and masterpiece, his life-size biography of Rizal. In his dedicatory remarks he gave voice to his abiding faith and confidence in the ability of the Filipino young men and women to make good.
Have they made good or are they making good? Were Rizal living today would he be proud of them? Would he say, if he could see them from beyond the tomb, that he did not die in vain, that his country’s sacred and beautiful hope has not disappointed him and those who like him had given their full measure of sacrifice for the glory of their Fatherland?
How fare the youth of the land? Are they planting the seeds that will make their country great? Do they realize the serious problems that now confront the Republic of the Philippines, which is their Republic, and are they contributing to the fullest extent to the solution of such problems? Are they putting their strong and broad shoulders on the wheel of progress and prosperity? Are they helping actively in the complete restoration of peace and order in their country and in the gigantic reconstruction work which both the people and the government must undertake? Are they doing their duty as citizens of the Republic, working for the common happiness and welfare of their respective communities?
As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap the fruits of progress and tranquillity? Man is the archetype of society. Both society and the nation grow as the individuals grow. Unless our youth prepare for the future, there will be no future for them.
“I want to let those who deny us every feeling of patriotism,” wrote Rizal, “that we know how to die for our duty and for our convictions. What matters death if one dies for what one loves, for one’s country, and for those one adores?”
In one of his parting letters he wrote “My future, my life, my joys, all I have sacrificed for my love for her”—referring to the Philippines. “Whatever be my fate, I will die blessing her and wishing her the dawn of her redemption.” That, you will agree, is a wonderful sentiment. Does the Filipino youth of today feel and cherish it?</a>

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.

                            12. Find 10 Active and Passive sentences in President Laurel's Speech.
In this critical period of our history, we need the heart, the soul and the vigor of the youth of our land to help us build our country on the most enduring basis of brotherhood and solidarity of all Filipinos. I am, therefore, happy to know of the integration of the Filipino youth and that the Filipino youth is now on the march. The question is: Where is it going? Is it marching with irresistible will and determination toward progress and civilization, peace and order, and the prosperity and happiness of the Fatherland? If it is, I, as the chosen head of our nation and our people, heartily welcome it and bid it Godspeed.
It is trite saying that the future belongs to youth, especially to those dynamic, aggressive and self-confident young men and women who have foresight. Thus, they have the bounden duty to ensure it. So much faith the greatest Filipino patriot and hero, Rizal, had in the youth of the land that while he was still in his teens, he dedicated to it his prize winning poem entitled “To the Filipino Youth,” and he called the Filipino youth not without reason and justification “Fair hope of my Fatherland.”
Several years later, when Rizal was in Madrid, he thought again of the Filipino youth. On the occasion of the signal honor and distinction conferred upon the famous Filipino painter Juan Luna when one of his paintings was awarded the highest prize in the artistic world, Rizal offered a touching toast. He expressed the fervent hope that the worthy and commendable examples of Juan Luna, and Resurrection, another famed Filipino painter, will be imitated or emulated by the Filipino youth. In the course of a few years that youth had become to him more than the “fair hope of my fatherland”; it had become the “sacred hope of my Fatherland.”
Rizal’s fair and sacred hope is represented by the young men and women of today, by you, the Filipino youth on the march, you who will be either the leaders and masters of your country and your country’s fate tomorrow or the hewers of wood and drawers of water for other people more ambitious and far-seeing than you, men with vision, with courage, and with an indomitable will to succeed whatever be the obstacles.
Inspired by the same noble sentiment, the late Dr. Rafael Palma, builder of the University of the Philippines, dedicated to the same youth, to the same “fair and sacred hope” of the Fatherland, his last work and masterpiece, his life-size biography of Rizal. In his dedicatory remarks he gave voice to his abiding faith and confidence in the ability of the Filipino young men and women to make good.
Have they made good or are they making good? Were Rizal living today would he be proud of them? Would he say, if he could see them from beyond the tomb, that he did not die in vain, that his country’s sacred and beautiful hope has not disappointed him and those who like him had given their full measure of sacrifice for the glory of their Fatherland?
How fare the youth of the land? Are they planting the seeds that will make their country great? Do they realize the serious problems that now confront the Republic of the Philippines, which is their Republic, and are they contributing to the fullest extent to the solution of such problems? Are they putting their strong and broad shoulders on the wheel of progress and prosperity? Are they helping actively in the complete restoration of peace and order in their country and in the gigantic reconstruction work which both the people and the government must undertake? Are they doing their duty as citizens of the Republic, working for the common happiness and welfare of their respective communities?
As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Are the Filipino young men and women of today sowing the seeds of peace and prosperity so that they will reap the fruits of progress and tranquillity? Man is the archetype of society. Both society and the nation grow as the individuals grow. Unless our youth prepare for the future, there will be no future for them.
“I want to let those who deny us every feeling of patriotism,” wrote Rizal, “that we know how to die for our duty and for our convictions. What matters death if one dies for what one loves, for one’s country, and for those one adores?”
In one of his parting letters he wrote “My future, my life, my joys, all I have sacrificed for my love for her”—referring to the Philippines. “Whatever be my fate, I will die blessing her and wishing her the dawn of her redemption.” That, you will agree, is a wonderful sentiment. Does the Filipino youth of today feel and cherish it?</h2><br />

                            21. Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.
