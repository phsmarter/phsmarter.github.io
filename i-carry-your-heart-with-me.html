                                            Learning Task 3: Read the story, then enumerate the events by filling in the graphic organizers below: Makato and the Cowrie Shell (A Thai Folktale) by Supanee Khanchanathiti Once upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or I friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work-I carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good- tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of I wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. What are you i thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. I would like to go on a journey for ! adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. I -The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. -They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. - Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. I'm so thirsty. Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy. Who are your father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. I come from the City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. -You are a very determined boy! said the woman.||Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of I woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which Imeant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the I elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a I lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. Where did the boy come from? I the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. -How old is he? the king asked further. -12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, ! said the king. -Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie. Rising Action Introduction Climax Falling Action Denouement​</a>

                                            young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

                                            Read the story before answering:
Once upon a time in this beautiful lake surrounded by mountains and the sweetest mango trees lived a monkey.
The lake also had a few crocodiles. There was one crocodile who was very fond of the mangoes that fell from the tree.
 As the crocodile visited the mango trees every day, it became friends with the monkey. The two animals would meet
every day. The monkey helped the crocodile by providing him with the freshest mangoes from the tree. In return, the
crocodile would make the monkey laugh with his silly jokes. Their relationship continued and they became close pals.
One day, the monkey took more mangoes from the tree and asked the crocodile to give some to his wife. The
crocodile readily agreed thinking that this would make his wife happy.
True enough, the crocodile’s wife was pleased. “These are the best-tasting mangoes in the entire lake!” The wife
was so curious about the mangoes and asked her husband where he got the fruits from. The crocodile told her about his
close friend, the monkey.
Suddenly, the crocodile’s wife made an evil plan in her mind. She asked her husband, “Does your friend eat these
fruits daily? These are the sweetest fruits we ever ate. Imagine how delicious the monkey’s heart would be if he ate
these fruits daily! I need the heart of your friend. Can you please bring it for me?”
The crocodile was startled by his wife’s comments. He replied, “But he is my close friend. I can’t do this to him.”
The crocodile’s wife told him, “Don’t worry! You can drown your friend by pretending to push him down into the water if he
doesn’t know how to swim.”
The crocodile thought about it for a long time but he finally agreed to bring the monkey to his wife.
The next day, the crocodile invited the monkey to join him and his wife for lunch. The monkey happily agreed
to be the guest. However, the monkey expressed his inability to swim in the lake.
The crocodile offered to carry the monkey on his back even bringing him back to the mango trees. The monkey
accepted his offer and rode on his back. As they reached halfway to their destination, the crocodile went under the water
to drown the monkey.
However, the monkey did not fall because he held tightly to the crocodile. The monkey got suspicious about
the crocodile’s actions and asked him to tell the truth.
Since the crocodile believed the monkey was his good friend, he confessed to the monkey about the conversation
he had with his wife. He even confessed to his wife’s plans to eat his heart!
The monkey was quick to respond, “Oh my dear friend, you should have told me this earlier. I left my heart on one
of the branches of the mango tree as I won’t carry it if I travel long. If you take me back, I can give you my heart.”
The crocodile agreed and took the monkey back to his mango trees. As they reached the tree where the monkey
lived, the monkey climbed quickly and escaped from the crocodile. He shouted at Crocodile, “I thought you were a good
friend but you cheated on me! I will never go back with you and never be your friend.”
The crocodile understood his mistake and returned home empty-handed, losing a good friend indeed.

                                            what is this poem all about? SHAMAN (for the Sukdan of Inabanga) By: Dr. Ulysses B. Aparece We both believe in this: place As either timed or timeless. A constant watchman though I am, I still dare cross the far boundaries In search of the other side of space. Gatherer of leaves, root, stones, you are The keeper of the ancient craft of touch Extending welcome to a new realm Where begins the travel of remembering. So I gain entrance to this great beyond, I must admit I carry a baggage for you To unburden, these fruits of my living. You thus begin your shaman’s journey On my body, a vast geography of frightened Muscles, bones, nerves, joints, veins. Your hands whisper the secrets of gabun, Kulavu, tanglad, kugang-kugan…. Green residences of gentle duwendes. Skill of hands untangles invisible knots In my stomach, quieting down murmurs Of the heart; yours is a sweet gurgle Of rivulets, breath of earth and forest: Mutya sa Kuampang, mutya sa Panghagban Mutya sa Matinlig, mutya sa Puwawan… Strange prayer that never really matters. The means is the message, a message, Until your crystals proclaim this portent: The world I left in one certain moment Has followed me with much vengeance, Now shakes your space from fossilized sleep. O great healer of fear—medicine man, Tambalan, oracionan, baylan, sukdan— What has happened to your knowing hands, Can’t they resist with open palms these Beastly creatures, maps of hardest structures? Where are your spirit familiars? Your canticles from the sanctuary called heart Cannot outlast the monster’s roars lording Over bleeding shrubberies, drowning Your place’s whispers, breezes sighs. How, in the end, you have become Your own province, of silence: red rivulets, Purple boundaries, capital wound. Mine, now, is the knowing touch of duty, Filling the void, wishing to connect, Sending you off, never letting go.​</a>

Not to get lost and disappear.I want to hug even invisible things.Without doubt, that day, a voice of salvation came to me.A story about just losing, like bleeding blood.Dyed in the dark night, but still, I won't stop walk.You're not alone anymore.Aah, we are forever tormented by our kabubuhan but if the dawn never comes, through the painful night.Surely, you who distrust nothing, will be able to love this accursed world.Now that we carry everything on our shoulders.It's time to take it back.</a>

He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or i friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work ! carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would 1 1 starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good- 1 tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to ! try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. - I would like to go on a journey for I adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. -I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. 1 i --The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. - They say Pra Ruang of ! Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime 1 i later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He ! I walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. - Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. -I'm so thirsty. - Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into 1 a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy.-Who are your 1 father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. -I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? ! How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra 1 1 i Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. - You are a i very determined boy! said the woman || Come along with me Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a I lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. -Where did the boy come from? ! the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. - How old is he? the king asked further. 1 -12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, i said the king. -Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie -​</a>

 “A borrowed book is like a guest in the house; it must be treated with punctiliousness, with a
 certain considerate formality. You must see that it sustains no damage; it must not suffer while under your roof. You cannot leave it carelessly, you cannot mark it, you cannot turn down the
 pages, you cannot use it familiarly. And then, someday, although this is seldom done, you really
 ought to return it.” _______________________________________________________

 dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonor shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your
 virtues in the field.”_______________________________________________

“we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall
 fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by
 the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its
 power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.”
 “In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in history, I send to every household of my peoples,
 both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.”</a>

I enjoyed each beautiful day atid it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket inade of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. “Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pandesal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESALI PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pandesal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When, suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream. 1. Describe the setting of the story. 2. Describe the girl's character. 3. What would you do if you were on the girl's shoe and your money was taken away? Explain your answer. 4. In your own ways, how can you help your parents / guardians? 5. Give a title of the story.​</a>

The woman who had moved with a start when the sliding door opened had been hearing the gangsas for she did not know how long. There was a sudden rush of fire in her. She gave no sign that she heard Awivao but continued to sit unmoving in the darkness. But Awiyao knew that she heard him, and his heart pitied her. He crawled on all fours to the middle of the room; he knew exactly where the stove was. With bare fingers he stirred the covered smoldering embers and blew into the stove. When the coals began to glow, Awivao put pieces of pine on them, then full round logs as his arms. The room brightened. "Why don't you go out," he said, "and join the dancing women?" He felt a pang inside him, because what he said was really not the right thing to say and because the woman did not stir. "You should join the dancers," he said, "as if--as if nothing had happened." He looked at the woman haddled in a corner of the room, leaning against the wall. The stove fire played with strange moving shadows and lights upon her face. She was partly sullen, but her sullenness was not because of anger or hate. "Go out-go out and dance. If you really don't hate me for this separation, go out and dance, One of the men will see you dance well; he will like your dancing, he will marry you.

"You know it Lumnay, don't you?" he repeated. "Yes, I know," she said weakly. "It is not my fault," he said, feeling relieved. "You cannot blame me; I have been a good husband to you." "Neither can you blame me," she said. She seemed about to cry. "No, you have been very good to me. You have been a good wife. I have nothing to say against​</a>

"The Mysterious Ring of the Beautiful Queen"
The king of Calvar, King Damian, was long dead. His Kingdom can be found in the farthest east of the world. It was left to his wife, Reyna Marikit.
The king and queen had four sons. They are Prince Diego, Prince Faustino, Prince Tales, and the youngest, Prince Marfino. Many wonders which of the four princes will be the heir to the Kingdom.
Only one can inherit the Kingdom. Nevertheless, unbeknownst to many, it was not the Kingdom that the four princes wanted to inherit, if not their mother's magical ring.
Only King Damian and their children know that Queen Marikit's ring is the reason why the wealth of their Kingdom is inexhaustible.
One day, the queen felt that she was really weak and she needed to decide to whom to give a ring. He accepted that he could disappear at any time.
For the queen to know to whom she should give a ring, she called the four sons and gave them much gold.
"Go to the other Kingdom. In the Kingdom of Tipora. Each of you should bring two sacks of gold. It is up to you what you do with the gold you bring there, "the queen said to her four children.
The brothers quickly grabbed two sacks of gold each. They rode on their horses and set out for the Kingdom of Tiphsah. When they got there, Prince Diego saw the princess of Tipora.
'Oh beautiful princess, I'm sorry, but my sisters and I are here to see if you're all right here?' said the prince, to the surprise of his brothers.
The three princes left and left Prince Diego, who was very nice to the princess. They talked all day, but the princess obviously didn't like him until she heard some nice words.
"I have two sacks of gold. "I would like to give it to your kingdom as a gift," said Prince Diego, who changed the princess's treatment of him. Because of this, he got the heart of the princess.
While traveling in Tipora, Prince Faustino suddenly stopped at a place where many were selling beautiful garments and jewelry. He stayed there, and there he used the gold he was carrying.
'They belong to me, the next king of Calvar,' said the prince while shopping for clothes to buy.
As Prince Tales and Prince Marfino traveled, they came to a part of the Kingdom where many farmers, slaves, and beggars lived. There, Prince Tales handed out a sack of gold he was carrying.
"My brother doesn't seem to be feeling well. "Prince Marfino said to himself while watching what Prince Tales was doing.
Before dark, the brothers traveled back to Calvar. Prince Diego and Prince Faustino no longer carry gold. Prince Tales brought back a sack of gold, and Prince Marfino still had two sacks.
When they arrived at Calvar, the three princes immediately rested while Prince Tales headed to the Eucharist, the place in their Kingdom where ordinary workers lived.
There, the prince entered the houses and handed out the gold he had brought. The people were very happy about this.
The next day, Queen Marikit summoned the four princes. There he told his children his decision about the Kingdom and the magical ring.
"My dear prince's, I have decided to whom the rule of the Kingdom and the magical ring will go. It hurts me to choose you, but I have to do it, and I hope you understand.
Diego, PrinceI cannot give you a ring because it cannot be used for personal intentions. It does not belong to you like the gold you gave to the princess to get her. The Kingdom is its owner.
As Prince Faustino said, royalty is not measured by dress. It measures how you take care of your Kingdom, including its wealth.
Prince Marfino, you are the only one who did not use the gold you brought to Tipora. Even when you come home here, there is no discount. However, I hope you understand that the hidden wealth does not grow. Many people need it.
So, I decided that the next king of Calvar would be Prince Tales. The magical ring will also go to him. He is like your father, who wants to help the smallest people in the Kingdom.
Prince Tales also did not hesitate to help the poor in the other Kingdom. You know that the wealth provided.</a>

One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school.

It didn't play the trick anymore after that day, and the seller was happy _____6.In most parts of the world, there are not so many crocodiles as there use to be This is a problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and also crocodiles are necessary to the balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died because people dried up the swamp and marshes where the crocodiles live.

Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort.

Read the story, then enumerate the events by filling im the graphic organizer below Makato and the Cowrie Shell (A Thai Folktale) by Supanee KhanchanathitiOnce upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. - What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. -The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. -Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. I'm so thirsty. -Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy. -Who are your father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Mon? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. You are a very determined boy! said the woman.||Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. - Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. -How old is he? the king asked further. -12 years old, your Majesty, replied thhe mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. -Take good care of him.

<p>- In a simile, two things which are completely unlocked are compared with each other. A simile is introduced by words such as like, so, as etc.
</p><p>
Examples
</p><p>
- The flower is as pretty as a picture.
</p><p>
- He is as sober as a judge.</p><p>- They fought like cats and dogs.</p>Metaphor
<p>- It is an informal or implied simile in which the words “like’ ‘as’ are avoided. For example, “He is like a Giant. (Simile) “and “He is a Giant. (metaphor)”.  </p><p>
Examples
</p><p>
- You are an apple of my eye.
</p><p>
- Ocean’s sound is music to my ear.</p>Personification

- It has been ages that I have had a proper meal.
</p><p>
- Usain Bolt runs faster than the wind.</p>Alliteration  <p>- It is the series of words which commence with the same letter. Alliteration consists of the repetition of a sound or of a letter at the beginning of two or more words.

Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

                            9. Read the story before answering:
Once upon a time in this beautiful lake surrounded by mountains and the sweetest mango trees lived a monkey.
The lake also had a few crocodiles. There was one crocodile who was very fond of the mangoes that fell from the tree.
 As the crocodile visited the mango trees every day, it became friends with the monkey. The two animals would meet
every day. The monkey helped the crocodile by providing him with the freshest mangoes from the tree. In return, the
crocodile would make the monkey laugh with his silly jokes. Their relationship continued and they became close pals.
One day, the monkey took more mangoes from the tree and asked the crocodile to give some to his wife. The
crocodile readily agreed thinking that this would make his wife happy.
True enough, the crocodile’s wife was pleased. “These are the best-tasting mangoes in the entire lake!” The wife
was so curious about the mangoes and asked her husband where he got the fruits from. The crocodile told her about his
close friend, the monkey.
Suddenly, the crocodile’s wife made an evil plan in her mind. She asked her husband, “Does your friend eat these
fruits daily? These are the sweetest fruits we ever ate. Imagine how delicious the monkey’s heart would be if he ate
these fruits daily! I need the heart of your friend. Can you please bring it for me?”
The crocodile was startled by his wife’s comments. He replied, “But he is my close friend. I can’t do this to him.”
The crocodile’s wife told him, “Don’t worry! You can drown your friend by pretending to push him down into the water if he
doesn’t know how to swim.”
The crocodile thought about it for a long time but he finally agreed to bring the monkey to his wife.
The next day, the crocodile invited the monkey to join him and his wife for lunch. The monkey happily agreed
to be the guest. However, the monkey expressed his inability to swim in the lake.
The crocodile offered to carry the monkey on his back even bringing him back to the mango trees. The monkey
accepted his offer and rode on his back. As they reached halfway to their destination, the crocodile went under the water
to drown the monkey.
However, the monkey did not fall because he held tightly to the crocodile. The monkey got suspicious about
the crocodile’s actions and asked him to tell the truth.
Since the crocodile believed the monkey was his good friend, he confessed to the monkey about the conversation
he had with his wife. He even confessed to his wife’s plans to eat his heart!
The monkey was quick to respond, “Oh my dear friend, you should have told me this earlier. I left my heart on one
of the branches of the mango tree as I won’t carry it if I travel long. If you take me back, I can give you my heart.”
The crocodile agreed and took the monkey back to his mango trees. As they reached the tree where the monkey
lived, the monkey climbed quickly and escaped from the crocodile. He shouted at Crocodile, “I thought you were a good
friend but you cheated on me! I will never go back with you and never be your friend.”
The crocodile understood his mistake and returned home empty-handed, losing a good friend indeed.

                            10. what is this poem all about? SHAMAN (for the Sukdan of Inabanga) By: Dr. Ulysses B. Aparece We both believe in this: place As either timed or timeless. A constant watchman though I am, I still dare cross the far boundaries In search of the other side of space. Gatherer of leaves, root, stones, you are The keeper of the ancient craft of touch Extending welcome to a new realm Where begins the travel of remembering. So I gain entrance to this great beyond, I must admit I carry a baggage for you To unburden, these fruits of my living. You thus begin your shaman’s journey On my body, a vast geography of frightened Muscles, bones, nerves, joints, veins. Your hands whisper the secrets of gabun, Kulavu, tanglad, kugang-kugan…. Green residences of gentle duwendes. Skill of hands untangles invisible knots In my stomach, quieting down murmurs Of the heart; yours is a sweet gurgle Of rivulets, breath of earth and forest: Mutya sa Kuampang, mutya sa Panghagban Mutya sa Matinlig, mutya sa Puwawan… Strange prayer that never really matters. The means is the message, a message, Until your crystals proclaim this portent: The world I left in one certain moment Has followed me with much vengeance, Now shakes your space from fossilized sleep. O great healer of fear—medicine man, Tambalan, oracionan, baylan, sukdan— What has happened to your knowing hands, Can’t they resist with open palms these Beastly creatures, maps of hardest structures? Where are your spirit familiars? Your canticles from the sanctuary called heart Cannot outlast the monster’s roars lording Over bleeding shrubberies, drowning Your place’s whispers, breezes sighs. How, in the end, you have become Your own province, of silence: red rivulets, Purple boundaries, capital wound. Mine, now, is the knowing touch of duty, Filling the void, wishing to connect, Sending you off, never letting go.​</h2><br />

Born in this world, where there is no salvation.The distorted shape of the heart yet it beats courageously.There is no turning back, even from the path of evil.Witnessing the withering seasons, we search for the truth.In our ugliness, we don't even recognize the pain.As we peel back the skin.Aah, we are forever tormented by our kabubuhan but if the dawn never comes, through the painful night.Surely, you who distrust nothing, will be able to love this accursed world.Now that we carry everything on our shoulders.Wearing the sadness, I've been lost in darkness.Even the leaves of words that do not hesitate, currently closing.There is no birth voice, not even a breath.You carry a lot of swords in your bag, I holdd the devil in my heart.With a wretched voice, we come from the bottom of this world.Still I hoped for tomorrow.Aah, even you sleep with loneliness and jealousy but I want to touch those loveful tears of yours.Surely if the moon is shaded, I can love you to end of this evening.That flame is still shaking.Not to be violated. Not to get lost and disappear.I want to hug even invisible things.Without doubt, that day, a voice of salvation came to me.A story about just losing, like bleeding blood.Dyed in the dark night, but still, I won't stop walk.You're not alone anymore.Aah, we are forever tormented by our kabubuhan but if the dawn never comes, through the painful night.Surely, you who distrust nothing, will be able to love this accursed world.Now that we carry everything on our shoulders.It's time to take it back.</h2><br />

He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or i friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work ! carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would 1 1 starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good- 1 tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to ! try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. - I would like to go on a journey for I adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. -I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. 1 i --The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. - They say Pra Ruang of ! Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime 1 i later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He ! I walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. - Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. -I'm so thirsty. - Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into 1 a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy.-Who are your 1 father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. -I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? ! How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra 1 1 i Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. - You are a i very determined boy! said the woman || Come along with me Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a I lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. -Where did the boy come from? ! the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. - How old is he? the king asked further. 1 -12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, i said the king. -Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie -​</h2><br />

I enjoyed each beautiful day atid it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket inade of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. “Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pandesal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESALI PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pandesal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When, suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream. 1.

"Ti sorry this had to be done. I am sorry. But neither of us can help it. Tbc sound of the gangsas beat through the walls of the dark house like muted roars of Talling waters. The woman who had moved with a start when the sliding door opened had been hearing the gangsas for she did not know how long. There was a sudden rush of fire in her. She gave no sign that she heard Awivao but continued to sit unmoving in the darkness. But Awiyao knew that she heard him, and his heart pitied her. He crawled on all fours to the middle of the room; he knew exactly where the stove was. With bare fingers he stirred the covered smoldering embers and blew into the stove. When the coals began to glow, Awivao put pieces of pine on them, then full round logs as his arms. The room brightened. "Why don't you go out," he said, "and join the dancing women?" He felt a pang inside him, because what he said was really not the right thing to say and because the woman did not stir. "You should join the dancers," he said, "as if--as if nothing had happened." He looked at the woman haddled in a corner of the room, leaning against the wall. The stove fire played with strange moving shadows and lights upon her face. She was partly sullen, but her sullenness was not because of anger or hate. "Go out-go out and dance. If you really don't hate me for this separation, go out and dance, One of the men will see you dance well; he will like your dancing, he will marry you. Who knows but that, with him, you will be luckier than you were with me."? "I don't want any man," she said sharply. "I don't want any other man." He felt relieved that at least she talked: "You know very well that I won't want any other woman either. You know that don't you? Lunnay, you know it, don't you?" She did not answer him. "You know it Lumnay, don't you?" he repeated. "Yes, I know," she said weakly. "It is not my fault," he said, feeling relieved. "You cannot blame me; I have been a good husband to you."

"The Mysterious Ring of the Beautiful Queen"
The king of Calvar, King Damian, was long dead. His Kingdom can be found in the farthest east of the world. It was left to his wife, Reyna Marikit.
The king and queen had four sons. They are Prince Diego, Prince Faustino, Prince Tales, and the youngest, Prince Marfino. Many wonders which of the four princes will be the heir to the Kingdom.
Only one can inherit the Kingdom. Nevertheless, unbeknownst to many, it was not the Kingdom that the four princes wanted to inherit, if not their mother's magical ring.
Only King Damian and their children know that Queen Marikit's ring is the reason why the wealth of their Kingdom is inexhaustible.
One day, the queen felt that she was really weak and she needed to decide to whom to give a ring. He accepted that he could disappear at any time.
For the queen to know to whom she should give a ring, she called the four sons and gave them much gold.
"Go to the other Kingdom. In the Kingdom of Tipora. Each of you should bring two sacks of gold. It is up to you what you do with the gold you bring there, "the queen said to her four children.
The brothers quickly grabbed two sacks of gold each. They rode on their horses and set out for the Kingdom of Tiphsah. When they got there, Prince Diego saw the princess of Tipora.
'Oh beautiful princess, I'm sorry, but my sisters and I are here to see if you're all right here?' said the prince, to the surprise of his brothers.
The three princes left and left Prince Diego, who was very nice to the princess. They talked all day, but the princess obviously didn't like him until she heard some nice words.
"I have two sacks of gold. "I would like to give it to your kingdom as a gift," said Prince Diego, who changed the princess's treatment of him. Because of this, he got the heart of the princess.
While traveling in Tipora, Prince Faustino suddenly stopped at a place where many were selling beautiful garments and jewelry. He stayed there, and there he used the gold he was carrying.
'They belong to me, the next king of Calvar,' said the prince while shopping for clothes to buy.
As Prince Tales and Prince Marfino traveled, they came to a part of the Kingdom where many farmers, slaves, and beggars lived. There, Prince Tales handed out a sack of gold he was carrying.
"My brother doesn't seem to be feeling well. "Prince Marfino said to himself while watching what Prince Tales was doing.
Before dark, the brothers traveled back to Calvar. Prince Diego and Prince Faustino no longer carry gold. Prince Tales brought back a sack of gold, and Prince Marfino still had two sacks.
When they arrived at Calvar, the three princes immediately rested while Prince Tales headed to the Eucharist, the place in their Kingdom where ordinary workers lived.
There, the prince entered the houses and handed out the gold he had brought. The people were very happy about this.
The next day, Queen Marikit summoned the four princes. There he told his children his decision about the Kingdom and the magical ring.
"My dear prince's, I have decided to whom the rule of the Kingdom and the magical ring will go. It hurts me to choose you, but I have to do it, and I hope you understand.
Diego, PrinceI cannot give you a ring because it cannot be used for personal intentions. It does not belong to you like the gold you gave to the princess to get her. The Kingdom is its owner.
As Prince Faustino said, royalty is not measured by dress. It measures how you take care of your Kingdom, including its wealth.
Prince Marfino, you are the only one who did not use the gold you brought to Tipora. Even when you come home here, there is no discount. However, I hope you understand that the hidden wealth does not grow. Many people need it.
So, I decided that the next king of Calvar would be Prince Tales. The magical ring will also go to him. He is like your father, who wants to help the smallest people in the Kingdom.
Prince Tales also did not hesitate to help the poor in the other Kingdom. You know that the wealth provided.</h2><br />

Read the story, then enumerate the events by filling im the graphic organizer below Makato and the Cowrie Shell (A Thai Folktale) by Supanee KhanchanathitiOnce upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. - What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. -The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. -Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. I'm so thirsty. -Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy. -Who are your father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Mon? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. You are a very determined boy! said the woman.||Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. - Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. -How old is he? the king asked further. -12 years old, your Majesty, replied thhe mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. -Take good care of him.
