                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

Directions: Read and study carefully the given excerpt. Use the organizer below.
We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the
pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members
of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via
instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our
different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by
extension, our vulnerability to epidemics
COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people
across every state in the United States and its four territories had te sted positive for COVID-19 According
to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United
States However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture, a closer look at data by different
social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been
disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right
to health fulfilled
The Disproportional Impact of COVID-19 on African Americans
Volume 22/2, December 2020, pp 299-307
Mantza Vasquez Reyes
According to the World Health Organization's report Closing Gap in a Generation Health Equity
through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, "poor and unequal living conditions are the
consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion he way societies are organized-poor
social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics. This toxic combination of
factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news cn the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States I recognize
that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does
not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.

                                            RA The Rags2Riches team ensured that its products were 100 percent consistent with their values. All the materials were upcycled and, thus, "eco-friendly" (e.g., organic materials that did not use harmful dyes or chemicals). Also, expansion resulted in engaging the other nearby communities. Clearly, the women-and other communities as well-had become empowered and enriched. Essentially, this social business enterprise sought to improve livelihood outcomes of the poor. Apart from ensuring attainment of the 3P's-people, planet, profits-, Rags2Riches sought to exert positive influence on the market, on the communities it works with, and eventually on the world. This case highlights the good effects that can be achieved by the mere desire to serve people and communities. Guide Questions: What is the main vision and mission of Rags2Riches? What did it seek to achieve? What method did the business employ in order to help in poverty alleviation? 2. 3. Is it possible for a business enterprise to fulfill a social function (such as help reduce poverty) and at the same time earn profit? Explain your answer based on the business model of Rags2Riches. 1. 4. Do you know of any other enterprise in the Philippines that has achieved what Rags2Riches has achieved, i.e., serve a social function and, at the same time, make money? If so, describe the nature or operations of that enterprise.​</a>

                            9. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

Directions: Read and study carefully the given excerpt. Use the organizer below.
We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the
pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members
of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via
instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our
different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by
extension, our vulnerability to epidemics
COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people
across every state in the United States and its four territories had te sted positive for COVID-19 According
to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United
States However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture, a closer look at data by different
social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been
disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right
to health fulfilled
The Disproportional Impact of COVID-19 on African Americans
Volume 22/2, December 2020, pp 299-307
Mantza Vasquez Reyes
According to the World Health Organization's report Closing Gap in a Generation Health Equity
through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, "poor and unequal living conditions are the
consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion he way societies are organized-poor
social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics. This toxic combination of
factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news cn the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States I recognize
that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does
not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.

It is also generally definedas regular exposure to elevated sound levels that may lead to adverse effectsin humans or other living organisms. According to the World HealthOrganization, sound levels less than 70 decibels (dB) are not damaging toliving organisms, regardless of how long or consistent the exposure is. Exposurefor more than 8 hours to constant noise beyond 85 dB may be hazardous. Ifyou work for 8 hours daily near a busy road or highway, you are very likelyexposed to traffic noise pollution around 85dB. (Environmental PollutionCenters)In urban areas, some causes of noise are land transportation vehiclesairplanes, helicopters, roadside repairs, ongoing constructions, andincreasing population. Continuous exposure to very loud sounds can affectthe health of people and may lead to stress, mental and emotional problems,and sleeping and hearing difficulties. These problems may further aggravatethe over-all health of a person and eventually lead to chronic diseases anddisorders.Some Effects of Noise Pollution:1. Health problems ranging from stress.2. Poor concentration or unable to focus on the things you do.3. Productivity losses in the workplace4. Communication difficulties.5.

                            18. ES Bitects of Nolse Pollution Leaming Activities Noise is unwanted or disturbing sound. It is also generally defined as regular exposure to elevated sound levels that may lead to adverse effects in humans or other Iving organisms. According to the World Health Organization, sound levels less than 70 decibels (dB) are not damaging to living organisms, regardless of how long or consistent the exposure is. Exposure for more than eight (8) hours to constant noise beyond 85 dB may be hazardous. If you work for eight (8) hours daily near a busy road or highway. you are very likely exposed to traffic noise pollution around 85dB (Environmental Pollution Centers). In urban areas, some causes of noise are land transportation vehicles, airplanes. helicopters, roadside repairs, ongoing constructions, and increasing population. Continuous exposure to very loud sounds can affect the health of people and may lead to stress, mental and emotional problerns, and sleeping and hearing difficulties. These problems may further aggravate the overal health of a person and eventually lead to chronic diseases and disorders. Some Effects of Noise Pollution: Health problems 2. Poor concentration or unable to focus on the things you do 3. Productivity losses in the workplace 4. Communication difficulties 5. Fatigue from lack of sleep​</h2><br />

                            20. RA The Rags2Riches team ensured that its products were 100 percent consistent with their values. All the materials were upcycled and, thus, "eco-friendly" (e.g., organic materials that did not use harmful dyes or chemicals). Also, expansion resulted in engaging the other nearby communities. Clearly, the women-and other communities as well-had become empowered and enriched. Essentially, this social business enterprise sought to improve livelihood outcomes of the poor. Apart from ensuring attainment of the 3P's-people, planet, profits-, Rags2Riches sought to exert positive influence on the market, on the communities it works with, and eventually on the world. This case highlights the good effects that can be achieved by the mere desire to serve people and communities. Guide Questions: What is the main vision and mission of Rags2Riches? What did it seek to achieve? What method did the business employ in order to help in poverty alleviation? 2. 3. Is it possible for a business enterprise to fulfill a social function (such as help reduce poverty) and at the same time earn profit? Explain your answer based on the business model of Rags2Riches. 1. 4. Do you know of any other enterprise in the Philippines that has achieved what Rags2Riches has achieved, i.e., serve a social function and, at the same time, make money? If so, describe the nature or operations of that enterprise.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The main vision and mission of Rags2Riches is to alleviate poverty by creating sustainable livelihood opportunities for marginalized communities, particularly women, through ethical fashion. The enterprise seeks to achieve social, environmental, and economic sustainability, which it calls the 3P's: people, planet, and profits. Rags2Riches aims to provide a fair and dignified income to its partner artisans while promoting sustainable fashion and minimizing its environmental impact.</p><p></p><p>2. Rags2Riches employs a social business model that empowers marginalized communities by providing them with skills training, design support, and access to the market. The enterprise works with partner communities to collect textile scraps and upcycle them into high-quality fashion and home accessories. Rags2Riches ensures that its products are consistent with its values, using only eco-friendly and organic materials that do not harm the environment or the people who produce them. By expanding its operations, Rags2Riches engages nearby communities, thus providing more opportunities for marginalized groups to participate in the value chain and earn a sustainable income.</p><p></p><p>3. Yes, it is possible for a business enterprise to fulfill a social function and earn a profit at the same time. Rags2Riches is an excellent example of this. By providing sustainable livelihood opportunities to marginalized communities, the enterprise is able to produce high-quality fashion products that appeal to consumers who value ethical and sustainable fashion. Rags2Riches has been successful in creating a market for its products by emphasizing the social and environmental benefits of its business model, which in turn generates profits that are reinvested in the enterprise and its partner communities.</p><p></p><p>4. There are other enterprises in the Philippines that have achieved a similar goal of serving a social function while making a profit. One example is Hapinoy, a social enterprise that provides microfinance and business development services to sari-sari store owners in rural areas. By helping these small business owners improve their operations and access to capital, Hapinoy is able to promote entrepreneurship and financial inclusion while generating revenue from its services. Another example is Human Nature, a natural and organic personal care and household products company that sources its ingredients from local farmers and employs community-based workers. Human Nature promotes ethical and sustainable sourcing while providing fair and dignified employment opportunities to its workers.</p><br />
