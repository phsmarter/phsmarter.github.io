                                            What's More
I always remember what my teacher in Values Education
said in her class one afternoon. She said that when we are born,
we do not have yet the set of values expected from us because
we learn them from our parents or adults who raise us. Yes, she
was right because we learn these from our elders. We learn by
examples and by watching or observing them at home.
Yes, the family plays a greater role in shaping a child into a
responsible and productive adult. The family is a child's first role
model. They do not only set examples but they give every child an
opportunity to make important choices and decisions. Parents are
the child's first teachers and whatever the child learns at home
will forever be carried on and handed down to the generations to
come.

                            27. What's More
I always remember what my teacher in Values Education
said in her class one afternoon. She said that when we are born,
we do not have yet the set of values expected from us because
we learn them from our parents or adults who raise us. Yes, she
was right because we learn these from our elders. We learn by
examples and by watching or observing them at home.
Yes, the family plays a greater role in shaping a child into a
responsible and productive adult. The family is a child's first role
model. They do not only set examples but they give every child an
opportunity to make important choices and decisions. Parents are
the child's first teachers and whatever the child learns at home
will forever be carried on and handed down to the generations to
come.
What did you learn from the selection?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I learned that values are taught at home. It starts in the family. Parents will plant the values in their children, then school will cultivate the seed. Then both parents and teachers help the students' value grow</p><br />
