                                            Instructions: Read the example of an argumentative essay below.  
Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                                            The writing process has four distinct phases. The first is invention, which isaided by any number of techniques, including free-writing, mind-mapping andoutlining. In this first stage, it's important for a writer not to edit but to let ideas flowand to simply get them down on paper. After invention, comes the first draft—thestage where the ideas start to take shape. Many writers use a sentence outline atthis stage to see where they need to cut and where they need to add material. Thefirst draft is also where writers should develop a tentative thesis to guide thestructure of their essay. The next stage of the process is when both the second andthird drafts are done. Here, ideas and structure are refined, and the thesis is reviseduntil it becomes the unifying idea of the paper. Finally, comes the last stage, that ofediting. Writers should take care at this stage that all sentence structure andpunctuation is correct, and they should make corrections to documentation format asneeded. Writers often repeat these four phases more than once, or skip a phase andgo back to it, making the writing process more cyclical than linear.​</a>

Any aid you can give when someone is hurt or otherwise suffering is important but can be lifesaving especially if you have the proper knowledge and skill. Even if you have little skill or knowledge just helping to alert others that there is a problem; someone who needs help, and calling for skilled aid can be significant in that person surviving.</p><p>A typical first aid course covers what to do when you find someone injured or unconscious. It provides an array of skills in handling a wide range of emergecies, both by injury and health conditions and illnesses. You will learn CPR, wound care and how to assess the person's over all condition and deduct how to proceed in a safe, prepared manner. As a child care worker for a number of years I was required to have first aid, level C which meant it included speciallized care for infants and children under 12 and not just adults. I personally find it vital to know how to handle emergency situations, and how to be helpful and safe when things go wrong. I have found knowing how to help and what to do keeps me from panicking when things go wrong.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>First Aid and Safety Awareness<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In the recent days, Taal Volcano had been erupting and there is no end seen yet. With this situation happening, it is critical for people to be prepared because anything can happen which means that people's health and safety would be threatened. Knowledge of proper first aid and safety is needed.</p><p></p><p>First, let's talk about first aid. This is important because the first aider bridges the gap between the patient and the hospital. In many cases, stopping the bleeding of the wound is critical to ensure there is no further blood loss. If no one is available to perform first aid or it is done improperly, someone who is just wounded might end up dead even before reaching a hospital. Hence, proper first aid must be done. The same can be said for stroke victims. In the Philippines, where lifestyle diseases are common, many people stroke out or have a heart attack. If this is not determined and addressed, the chances of that person surviving is significantly decreased. </p><p></p><p>Second, let's tackle safety. Taking precautions to be safe is something most Filipinos ignore. Take the example of not wearing helmets or using seat belts when driving. Many of us take safety for granted when it is one very important aspect of our life. People should be reminded that safety is not only for one's self but for others as well. We should not endanger others by engaging in reckless activities. </p><p></p><p>In sum, it is critical for awareness on both these things for Filipinos to have a safe and sound life. We want to live fulfilling lives, which will not happen if we are plagued with diseases and accidents or we are not knowledgeable in handling things when safety is compromised.</p><p></p><p>For more information:</p><p>Volcanic Hazards: https://brainly.ph/question/1064863</p><br />

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First Aid knowledge is invaluable for both you as the individual and for your community. It enables you to assist persons who become injured in the event of an accident or emergency situation until help arrives. First Aid skills can be applied in the home, the workplace or in public locations, therefore the more First Aid certified people there are in a community the safer that community becomes.</p><p></p><p>why is first aid important</p><p>Becoming First Aid certified not only benefits you as an individual but it extends to your family, friends, co-workers and even the community as a whole. As unpleasant as it is to talk about, accidents and emergency situations are not completely preventable or unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>If an accident happens in the workplace, in your home or in a public space, being a helpless witness to an emergency situation can potentially worsen the situation.</p><p></p><p>This is why it is very important for as many people as possible to have at least a basic knowledge of First Aid.</p><p></p><p>In its most basic form, First Aid is the initial assistance given to a victim of injury or illness. Basic First Aid knowledge is comprised of relatively simple techniques and procedures that can be performed with limited equipment and is typically carried out until professional medical assistance arrives.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

In this first stage, it's important for a writer not to edit but to let ideas flowand to simply get them down on paper. After invention, comes the first draft—thestage where the ideas start to take shape. Many writers use a sentence outline atthis stage to see where they need to cut and where they need to add material. Thefirst draft is also where writers should develop a tentative thesis to guide thestructure of their essay. The next stage of the process is when both the second andthird drafts are done. Here, ideas and structure are refined, and the thesis is reviseduntil it becomes the unifying idea of the paper. Finally, comes the last stage, that ofediting. Writers should take care at this stage that all sentence structure andpunctuation is correct, and they should make corrections to documentation format asneeded. Writers often repeat these four phases more than once, or skip a phase andgo back to it, making the writing process more cyclical than linear.​</h2><br />

                            18. Write an essay for the importance of RICE  method in the basic first aid procedure for sprains and strains TY sa sagot​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>RICE is a word you’ll want to remember, especially if you play lots of sports. It’s a word, but it’s also an acronym. This acronym can help you remember several basic treatments for soft tissue injuries, specifically, rest, ice, compression, and elevation. RICE is considered a first aid technique rather than a complete or comprehensive medical treatment. If you receive a joint injury or sprain while playing sports, or anytime, just remember RICE until you can get to the Cleveland Emergency Hospital for medical attention.
</p><p>
</p><p>Joint sprains can occur when a joint is twisted in awkward ways, and ligaments are stretched beyond their normal limits. For example, ankle sprains can occur when a person steps on an irregular surface or exerts too much force causing the ankle to turn inward. Sprained ankles are common in sporting activities but can occur anytime a person makes a ‘wrong’ move. The result is that tendons in the foot and ankle are injured and become inflamed. Fluids, as well as blood flow in the area, increases causing redness and swelling. Nerves around the injury become more sensitive resulting in pain, especially if pressure is exerted on the foot by standing or walking.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
