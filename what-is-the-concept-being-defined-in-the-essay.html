He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great.

                                            Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</a>

Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it. Formal Definition ng maile others iso Sense of humor is the ability to laugh and make others laugh ↓ A formal definition consists of three parts: the term being defined, the class it belongs to, and its distinguishing characteristics.

Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great.

                            7. Compare and Contrast Write an essay to compare and contrast Tay and Gonzales Effective Listening Approach in not less than 100 words Gonzalez (2017) defined informational listening as listening with the goal of leaming. understanding, and grasping information. It is considered a passive form of listening because the listener is not judging, criticizing, or evaluating the message but is simply listening to understand it For example, Maria is listening to an informative talk about the modern cultural trends of her fellow millennials. In order to effectively engage in informational listening, Maria must keep her conservative traditional beliefs. bay in order to abstain from judging and critiquing the message her classmate is trying to convey. Tay (2020) identifies some of the effective informational listening approaches which are: Info listening. Make sure you receive the same thoughts which speakers are trying to convey. Don't judge or argue prematurely. Try to understand the speaker's ideas before judging them. Look for key ideas. Listen carefully to the speaker to find out the main ideas that he or she is trying to convey. Paraphrase. Restate in your own words the message of the speaker. Repeating the speaker's words as he or she says them will strengthen his or her message and help you to stay attentive. Gonzalez (2020) also added that informational listening helps us leam, become keener, and become better at what we do in life. Consequently, it is clear that improving skills that develop our informational listening abilities is advantageous to our lives. Other skills that help with informational listening are: Knowledge of Vocabulary. The more words we know, the more we can understand. Therefore, increasing mastery of vocabulary through techniques like leaming a new word a day or reading books can contribute in being a good informational listener. Concentration. We must know that in order to concentrate, we need to be motivated to focus, stay disciplined in the face of distractions, actively and mentally say no to distractions, and accept responsibility in getting the task at hand accomplished. Informational listening requires immense concentration. Memory. With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. Refraining from Judgment. This skill requires an open mind. If we begin judging and jumping to conclusions when attempting to properly listen and retain information, our mind will wander and possibly miss valuable pieces of information. Organization. This means identifying key concepts from auditory information and mentally organizing them into an outline so that you can better understand and remember material. Asking Questions. If listening to a panel discussion, asking mental questions to further grasp the information as the speakers are talking can mean that the listener is truly comprehending the information that is being said. Taking Notes. This is a common skill that enhances informational listening in school. One valuable tip in taking notes is to only write down key concepts and terms instead of trying to write down everything that is being said.​</h2><br />
