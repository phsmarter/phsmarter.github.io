An interview with John Moe (writer, humorist,
and National Public Radio host ) on the
pandemic and mental health
The percentage of people reporting symptoms of
depression, and a disorder level of depression is way up,
John emphasizes, and this does not show signs of
decreasing anytime soon.
“There’s this concept I read about called the
bereavement multiplier, where for every person who dies
of COVID-19, there are on average nine people in their
immediate family who will be grieving. If you take that
number and multiply it times the number of people who
have died, you have millions of people feeling stuck,
missing work, and not functioning at their best.”
John thinks that trauma, which is “completely under-
recognized as a source for mental disorders” explains the
rapidly increasing numbers of people experiencing mental
illness during the pandemic. He believes this influx of new
cases will put a tremendous strain on a mental health
care system that is already ill-equipped to receive them
and tells us that “there are parts of the country where
there’s barely any health professionals for the number of
people who live there.”
Along with bringing much-needed awareness to this
problem, John feels that some sort of system needs to be
put into place to effectively treat the growing amount of
people experiencing mental illness. He feels this can only
happen when there is proper representation of mental
health professionals on the White House Council on
Coronavirus.

                                            Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

                                            pa summary pounderstanding; and finally, a ‘community of practice' approach that centers on how students and teachers are absorbed into and become part of the academic practices for technical community. We propose three practical ways in which such a community approach within the assessment environment may be prompted and enhanced through the use of: social learning space, both physical and virtual; social learning, technical learning and collaborative assessment practices within developing student to enhance intelligence. Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​</a>

________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.

An interview with John Moe (writer, humorist,
and National Public Radio host ) on the
pandemic and mental health
The percentage of people reporting symptoms of
depression, and a disorder level of depression is way up,
John emphasizes, and this does not show signs of
decreasing anytime soon.
“There’s this concept I read about called the
bereavement multiplier, where for every person who dies
of COVID-19, there are on average nine people in their
immediate family who will be grieving. If you take that
number and multiply it times the number of people who
have died, you have millions of people feeling stuck,
missing work, and not functioning at their best.”
John thinks that trauma, which is “completely under-
recognized as a source for mental disorders” explains the
rapidly increasing numbers of people experiencing mental
illness during the pandemic. He believes this influx of new
cases will put a tremendous strain on a mental health
care system that is already ill-equipped to receive them
and tells us that “there are parts of the country where
there’s barely any health professionals for the number of
people who live there.”
Along with bringing much-needed awareness to this
problem, John feels that some sort of system needs to be
put into place to effectively treat the growing amount of
people experiencing mental illness. He feels this can only
happen when there is proper representation of mental
health professionals on the White House Council on
Coronavirus.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This passage discusses the importance of assessment and feedback in education, specifically in technical and vocational learning environments. The authors propose a "community of practice" approach to assessment, which focuses on involving students and teachers in academic practices and enhancing collaborative assessment practices. The passage also highlights the results of the National Student Survey, which shows that students are less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments compared to other aspects of their learning experience. The passage also emphasizes the importance of accurately assessing student skills and affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes, and anxiety, and suggests that universities should focus more on assessing these factors in addition to cognitive skills.</p><br />

CategoryIn the News·         Date PublishedJan 09, 2023National Achievement Test for Grade 12 students setMANILA, Philippines — Grade 12 students from public and private schools will be taking the National Achievement Test (NAT) by the end of the month.In a memorandum released on Jan. 5, Education Undersecretary Epimaco Densing said the exit assessment, which was designed to be “progressive in nature,” would be administered on Jan. 30 and Jan. 31.“DepEd has to identify and articulate indicators and targets for measuring performance in the development of plans and policies,” he said.The test results will serve as data and evidence in improving the implementation of the curriculum, as well as evidence-based decision-making.According to Densing, the test items would measure varying levels of skills through a multiple-choice paper-based format.“It is designed to determine if graduating learners are meeting the learning standard in the senior high school (SHS) curriculum,” he said.The NAT result will also give insight into the percentage of Grade 12 students who have the minimum level of proficiency in the fourth stage of the SHS core areas.The test will cover 21st-century skills and the primary learning topics in SHS including languages, humanities, communication, mathematics, science, social science, and philosophy.An online national orientation was held on Jan. 6 to issue the specific guidelines for the test administration and the tasks of field-testing personnel and download of program support funds by the schools’ division office.In a study published last year, the government think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) pointed out that failure to let the public know about the NAT results had contributed to the ongoing education crisis.“Even though we continuously administer national achievement tests, the results are never granularly available for in-depth analysis and even less public discussion,” said the report authored by PIDS president Aniceto Orbeta Jr. and research fellow vicente paqueo help!!​</h2><br />

                            21. Read the following essay and answer the questions below.
Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.
Standardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.
One of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated. 
On the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, a simple memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge actually becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.
One can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which reduces or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement

                            29. pa summary pounderstanding; and finally, a ‘community of practice' approach that centers on how students and teachers are absorbed into and become part of the academic practices for technical community. We propose three practical ways in which such a community approach within the assessment environment may be prompted and enhanced through the use of: social learning space, both physical and virtual; social learning, technical learning and collaborative assessment practices within developing student to enhance intelligence. Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This text discusses the importance of assessment in higher education and the need to move beyond cognitive assessments to include affective characteristics such as motivation and attitudes toward learning. It highlights the findings of a national student survey which indicates that students are less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments compared to other aspects of their learning experience. The text also proposes a "community of practice" approach to enhance assessment practices by using social learning spaces and collaborative assessment practices. The authors argue that assessment is critical for determining what skills students need to develop, and advising is necessary to ensure that students understand their assessment results and are placed in appropriate courses. However, the text notes that currently, only a small percentage of community colleges assess students' affective characteristics.</p><br />

The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.
