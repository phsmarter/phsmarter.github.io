Laguna on June 19, 1861. He was the second son and the seventh
among the eleven children of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso.
Rizal’s first teacher was his mother. He learned the alphabet from his
mother at the age of three and could read and write at the age of 5.He
studied at Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a
bachelor’s degree with highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at
the University of Sto Tomas but had to stop because he felt the Filipino
students were being discriminated by their Dominican teachers. He
went to Madrid and studied at the Universidad Central de Madrid where
he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters in 1885 at the age of
24.
He died on December 30, 1896 in Manila at the age of thirty- five
years old.

____4. The Department of Health strongly urges the public to observe the
following protective measures: To stay home during coronavirus
pandemic to better control the pandemic. Maintain at least 1-meter
distance between yourself and others because when someone coughs,
sneezes, or speaks he/she sprays small liquid droplets from his/her
nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has
the disease. DOH also advises the people to practice frequent and
proper handwashing. Wash hands only with soap and water for at least
20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are
not available. Avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals, and
products that come from animals such as uncooked meat and ensure
that food is well-cooked.
____5. Marikina is known as the "Shoe Capital of the Philippines" for its
famous shoe industry. It is the biggest manufacturer of shoes in
the Philippines, producing almost 70% of shoes made in the country. It
is also the home of the world’s largest pair of shoes certified by the
Guiness Book of World Records. Marikina is in the northeast of Metro
Manila and is currently one of the most competitive cities in the
country. Before becoming known for its shoes, Marikina was recognized
as a big producer of rice and vegetables. It was first inhabited by the
Augustinians in 1500, followed by the Jesuits in 1630. The town was
first called “Marquina,” after the Spanish governor-general Felix
Berenguer de Marquina; the name was changed to “Marikina” during
the American occupation in 1901. It became a city on December 8,
1996.

Background of study
BACKGROUND OF STUDY
This study focuses on Students preferred program for Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) Strand students at Philippine College of Criminology. Researchers used survey questionnaires to acquire information regarding the implications of the factors that influence the choice courses. The questionnaire made it simple to gather ideas.
HYPHOTHESIS
Socioeconomic status must be taken into account as it directs us toward the right careers and educational paths. Our socioeconomic situation will also enable us to understand the requirements for a given profession. For instance, pursuing a job in the medical field might be beneficial in the long run given the high demand in that field.
SCOPE AND DELIMITATION 
60% of the students we survey chose that their preferred course was BS CRIM and 40% Of the survey chose different courses. The expectation this first semester of the 2022-2023 school year is that there are more programs to come to open their minds in what course do they want to choose.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The influence of family, specifically parents, on the career decisions of their children, and how gender and socioeconomic status influence this choice, has been examined. Research was carried out using data obtained from a questionnaire administered to students who took the university entrance examination Philippine college of criminology.
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
Humanities and Social Sciences in Philippine College of Criminology preferred program choosing a college course/degree. strand is intended for those who wish to explore careers in social sciences. strand will involve a lot of research and presentation, making it a good preparation for their future careers.</a>

studied at Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a
bachelor’s degree with highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at
the University of Sto Tomas but had to stop because he felt the Filipino
students were being discriminated by their Dominican teachers. He
went to Madrid and studied at the Universidad Central de Madrid where
he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters in 1885 at the age of
24.
He died on December 30, 1896 in Manila at the age of thirty- five

nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has
the disease. DOH also advises the people to practice frequent and
proper handwashing. Wash hands only with soap and water for at least

Guiness Book of World Records. Marikina is in the northeast of Metro
Manila and is currently one of the most competitive cities in the
country. Before becoming known for its shoes, Marikina was recognized
as a big producer of rice and vegetables. It was first inhabited by the
Augustinians in 1500, followed by the Jesuits in 1630. The town was
first called “Marquina,” after the Spanish governor-general Felix
Berenguer de Marquina; the name was changed to “Marikina” during
the American occupation in 1901. It became a city on December 8,
1996.
