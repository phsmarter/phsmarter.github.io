                        To start thinking about our modern world without the existence of computers we must go back to the moment when modern electronic computers came into existence.<br /><br />In 1936 Alan Turing published one of the most influential works on the theoretical concept of a computer, called “On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem“.<br /><br />eniac-computer<br />(ENIAC: Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer, 1946)<br /><br />The idea of an electronic computational device gained momentum in the decade after Turing published his theory. A decade later, in 1946, British computer scientists John Mauchly and Presper Eckert created the ENIAC, the first digital, electronic computer.<br /><br />This, in short, eventually led to all of the computer devices we see around us today. But then the question is what if Alan Turing never came up with his theory for the digital computer? And what if scientists never tried to create the first electronic computer? Looking at these crucial breakthroughs in the 1930s and 1940s one can imagine that the technology available until that time period would have most probably prevailed and evolved in different ways. In other words, we wouldn’t have had calculators, smartphones, desktop computers, laptops, game consoles, computer chips, memory cards, the internet, digital camera’s and almost all of the other electronic devices we see around us today. When you start to think about it, without those crucial steps into the world of computers we wouldn’t be doing the things we do today, and would perhaps not even be the people we are today.<br /><br />windows-95<br />(Microsoft Windows 95 operating system, 1995)<br /><br />Life without modern computers would most probably be very similar to the time period before computers came into our lives. I remember I first got in touch with a computer as a toddler, around 1995, when they installed Windows 95 based PCs at my primary school. Several years later we were able to afford our own PC, and by 1998 I was playing games on my PlayStation, Gameboy and PC, and making documents using text editing software like Word.<br /><br />I am certain that all of these early experiences triggered my interest in the computer subject, which eventually led me to studying Communication and Multimedia Design at university and me starting this very blog. So I think it is safe for me to say that computers have played a key role in making me who I am and how I see the world around me.<br /><br />book text<br />(Book page, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers)<br /><br />Without the computer I would perhaps have spend more time reading books and had, in stead of playing digital games, played board games or other games with friends. Would that have made me a different person? I think it would at least have made me a whole lot more unaware of the things happening in the world, relying more on local books, television and radio for information.<br /><br />In stead of having internet and digital television as the dominant media, books, magazines, television, newspapers and radio would have most probably dominated the media landscape without computers (similar to the time before computers become mainstream).<br /><br />In stead of research funds going towards computer science other fields of science would have perhaps evolved in unexpected ways. Perhaps non-electronic machines would have played a bigger role in society and perhaps whole new non-electronic technologies would have emerged.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Introduction"
</p><p>What would be the world like if computers did not exist? This is one of the most difficult questions that call for one to imagine the world without all the technological growth that has been realized over the past decades. Since the development of the first computer, technology experienced an exponential growth that has led to the concept of globalization and the enhancement of the quality of life for people across the world. It is apparent that the computer technology fostered many positive changes in the society, and computers are an indispensable part of the modern society because they have enhanced the survival of humans.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Communication"
</p><p>One of the major contributions of the computer technology in the world has been the enhancement of the quality of communication. The computer technology alongside the discovery of the internet has eliminated the slow communication platforms that were used in the past (Boothroyd 2011). For instance, without the computer technology, people would have to communicate with their distance relatives through letters. It would be extremely slow to share information with relatives from different parts of the world, and it would be especially difficult to be updated on different global developments (Olsen 2012).
</p><p>
</p><p>Computers facilitated instant messaging and access to information from the mass media companies across the world. Additionally, the growth of the social media platforms has made the world a global village where people from different parts of the world can share information easily. Living without the computer technology would be characterized by slow and limited access to information.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Health Care"
</p><p>Living without the computer technology would also be characterized by a high mortality rate because the quality of the health care services would be very low compared to the status in the modern world. It is apparent that computers have facilitated the development of technologies that have enhanced preventive health care in the world, as well as the development of medications for various illnesses. Computers are used to analyze different specimens in laboratories to detect illnesses and their potential remedies (Hawkin 2012). Without computers, health care providers would only rely on the knowledge of symptoms to treat patients. This would result in many deaths because illnesses like cancer would not be easily detected without the use of the computer technology.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Human Skills"
</p><p>The computer technology has become an indispensable aspect of the modern world. Scientists have overly concentrated on the enhancement of the capabilities of the computers instead of investing in the enhancement of human skills (Baldry 2012).
</p><p>
</p><p>It is apparent that computers have taken over different jobs and made human skills obsolete (Ford 2016). The world without computers would compel the authorities to invest in human skills and knowledge, and this would result in a society that is highly specialized in different doctrines. This implies that the rate of unemployment would be relatively low across the world because the corporate sector would require a high number of employees to handle the tasks that computers perform on a daily basis.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>I hope it helps po! godbless :)</p><br />

                        <p>My Life Without Computer</p><p></p><p>Imagine a life without computers. No laptops, no smartphones, no internet, no social media, no online gaming, no e-commerce, and no email. It sounds like a scary thought, but it's not impossible to imagine. In fact, it's a life that many people lived before the digital age. But if we were to live without computers now, what would our lives be like?</p><p></p><p>For starters, communication would be different. We would have to rely on traditional means of communication like snail mail, telephones, and face-to-face conversations. We would have to go to the post office to send letters and wait for days or even weeks for a response. Telephone conversations would be more expensive as long-distance calls were charged by the minute. Face-to-face conversations would be more common as we would have to rely on personal interactions to communicate.</p><p></p><p>In terms of work, we would have to use typewriters and carbon paper for making copies. There would be no email to send documents instantly, and we would have to physically deliver them. Research would be done in libraries, and we would have to physically search through books and journals for information. It would be a time-consuming and laborious process compared to the convenience of searching for information on the internet.</p><p></p><p>Entertainment would also be different. We would have to rely on television, movies, books, and magazines for entertainment. There would be no online gaming or streaming services. We would have to go to the cinema to watch movies and wait for our favorite shows to air on television. Music would be limited to radio and physical copies of albums.</p><p></p><p>Our lives would also be less convenient. We would have to go to physical stores to buy groceries, clothes, and other necessities. We would have to rely on cash as there would be no online banking or e-commerce. Banking would require us to go to the bank and fill out paperwork to perform transactions.</p><p></p><p>However, living without computers could also have some positive effects. We would be more connected to our physical surroundings and more present in our daily lives. We would have more face-to-face interactions and develop stronger relationships with the people around us. We would have to rely on our memory and organizational skills as there would be no digital tools to help us.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, living without computers would be a significant change in our lives. It would require us to adapt to traditional means of communication, work, and entertainment. It would be less convenient and more time-consuming, but it could also have positive effects on our personal connections and mental abilities. Ultimately, it's important to remember that technology is a tool, and it's up to us to decide how to use it to improve our lives.</p><br />

They have revolutionized industries, made information accessible, and increased productivity. From online communication to virtual classrooms, computers have transformed education. They have also empowered creativity through digital art, music production, and entertainment. Computers have made our lives more convenient with online shopping, banking, and managing daily tasks. Although living without computers is theoretically possible, it would require significant adjustments and adaptations in various aspects of life. Our reliance on computers has become ingrained in modern society, making them indispensable in our daily routines.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Introduction
</strong></p><p><strong>What would be the world like if computers did not exist? This is one of the most difficult questions that call for one to imagine the world without all the technological growth that has been realized over the past decades. Since the development of the first computer, technology experienced an exponential growth that has led to the concept of globalization and the enhancement of the quality of life for people across the world. It is apparent that the computer technology fostered many positive changes in the society, and computers are an indispensable part of the modern society because they have enhanced the survival of humans.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Communication
</strong></p><p><strong>One of the major contributions of the computer technology in the world has been the enhancement of the quality of communication. The computer technology alongside the discovery of the internet has eliminated the slow communication platforms that were used in the past (Boothroyd 2011). For instance, without the computer technology, people would have to communicate with their distance relatives through letters. It would be extremely slow to share information with relatives from different parts of the world, and it would be especially difficult to be updated on different global developments (Olsen 2012).
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Computers facilitated instant messaging and access to information from the mass media companies across the world. Additionally, the growth of the social media platforms has made the world a global village where people from different parts of the world can share information easily. Living without the computer technology would be characterized by slow and limited access to information.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Health Care
</strong></p><p><strong>Living without the computer technology would also be characterized by a high mortality rate because the quality of the health care services would be very low compared to the status in the modern world. It is apparent that computers have facilitated the development of technologies that have enhanced preventive health care in the world, as well as the development of medications for various illnesses. Computers are used to analyze different specimens in laboratories to detect illnesses and their potential remedies (H a w k i n 2012). Without computers, health care providers would only rely on the knowledge of symptoms to treat patients. This would result in many deaths because illnesses like cancer would not be easily detected without the use of the computer technology.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Human Skills
</strong></p><p><strong>The computer technology has become an indispensable aspect of the modern world. Scientists have overly concentrated on the enhancement of the capabilities of the computers instead of investing in the enhancement of human skills (B a l d r y 2012).
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It is apparent that computers have taken over different jobs and made human skills obsolete (Ford 2016). The world without computers would compel the authorities to invest in human skills and knowledge, and this would result in a society that is highly specialized in different doctrines. This implies that the rate of unemployment would be relatively low across the world because the corporate sector would require a high number of employees to handle the tasks that computers perform on a daily basis.
