                                            Goals: Your goal is to write a reflective essay on developing the sense of nationalism.
 Your goal is to write a reflective essay expressing your appreciation to the struggles of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization which helped you develop your sense of nationalism.
Role: You are a Filipino student.
Audience: Your classmates and teachers.
Situation: In this time that your generation’s (Generation Z) sense of nationalism, is being challenged by globalization, you are tasked to reflect and ask yourself about how much love you have for your country. You should share your own experience, which you think is comparable to the experiences of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization in their struggle to achieve freedom and unity. You should also suggest ways on how your generation can deepen the sense of nationalism.
Performance: As you write your essay, you should consider the following:
1. For your introduction, choose one of the struggles experienced by the Filipinos during the Spanish period. Explain how these struggles affect their lives as native Filipinos.
2. For the body of your essay, relate these struggles with your own experiences by citing instances where you encountered struggles in your life and how you were able to cope with them.
3. For your conclusion, as a student explain how these struggles helped deepen your sense of nationalism. You may cite ways on how a student like you can deepen the sense of nationalism.</a>

Dear Teacher (YOUR TEACHER'S NAME), 
Thank you for being an excellent teacher. I know that teachers like you are not that easy to find. Everyday you came to school with a big smile on your face and a kind word for all of us. Your love of learning ignited our curiosity and made learning much more interesting. You taught us to think with a clear mind and write with clarity. I'll never forget those essays you made us write in class. Well yeah, I wasn't exactly 'That happy' with you for giving me much work. But today, I learned the value of all that work. Thank you for teaching us and bringing us closer to Jesus and God. I/We wouldn't be here today without you. With all sincerity, Y/N (Your Name).</a>

                                            write the conjunction found in the essay below.?For years and years, English teachers at elementary and middle schools across the United States would have been astonished by that question. Mrs. Beedle, my fourth grade teacher, would have turned from the blackboard to glare at any student who asked such an absurd thing. (Yeah, blackboards were still being used when I went to school.)“Of course you may not begin a sentence with a conjunction,” she would have snapped. “Why, the very idea!”We believed her. Back then, we trusted Mrs. Beedle. We loved how she could explain the rules of English so there were always definite answers, in crisp black and white, with no ambiguity whatsoever. Grammar was rational, comforting, and precise, while the real world was messy and complicated. And Mrs. Beedle was our guide to that land of certainty.I’m sure some of my classmates went on to become English teachers themselves, and they taught their students the lessons Mrs. Beedle gave us, and their students’ students passed on the same message to later generations. Chief among those lessons was the prohibition against starting a sentence with a conjunction.But Mrs. Beedle was wrong.​</a>

You should also suggest ways on how your generation can deepen the sense of nationalism.
Performance: As you write your essay, you should consider the following:
1. For your introduction, choose one of the struggles experienced by the Filipinos during the Spanish period. Explain how these struggles affect their lives as native Filipinos.
2. For the body of your essay, relate these struggles with your own experiences by citing instances where you encountered struggles in your life and how you were able to cope with them.

I was born and raised in the Philippines and throughout the years, I have seen the changes in the attitudes, practices, culture, and beliefs of the Filipinos. The world is continuously evolving, and the modernization is spreading across the world. Each one of us have the duty and responsibility to fulfill that most of us already forgotten about it and even these changes occur, there are still ways to show the respect and love for our country. </p><br />

                        <p><strong> I personally disagree with DepED Order No. 49 series of 2022</strong> which says that teachers are not allowed to socialize with their students unless they are relatives because <strong>I think</strong> socializing is a right for everyone, including between teachers and students. Although it is said that the purpose of this rule is to prevent bias and unwanted things from happening between students and teachers, <strong>in my opinion,</strong> there is no need for this kind of rule.</p><p>         Schools can provide clear direction and regulation regarding boundaries and good ways of socializing between pupils and teachers. <strong>From my point of view</strong> this is a better action than blocking their socialization because apart from the bias that may occur, socialization between students and teachers outside of school activities is not entirely bad because it allows them to become close and makes their relationship less rigid and creates an atmosphere learning to be fun.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The opinion markers</strong> used in the text above are: I think, in my opinion, from my point of view.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about opinions regarding the Deped Order No. 49 2022</strong></p><p>brainly.ph/question/30057184</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

Mrs. Beedle, my fourth grade teacher, would have turned from the blackboard to glare at any student who asked such an absurd thing. (Yeah, blackboards were still being used when I went to school.)“Of course you may not begin a sentence with a conjunction,” she would have snapped. “Why, the very idea!”We believed her. Back then, we trusted Mrs. Beedle. We loved how she could explain the rules of English so there were always definite answers, in crisp black and white, with no ambiguity whatsoever. Grammar was rational, comforting, and precise, while the real world was messy and complicated. And Mrs. Beedle was our guide to that land of certainty.I’m sure some of my classmates went on to become English teachers themselves, and they taught their students the lessons Mrs. Beedle gave us, and their students’ students passed on the same message to later generations. Chief among those lessons was the prohibition against starting a sentence with a conjunction.But Mrs. Beedle was wrong.​</h2><br />

I will start by assessing the level of dancing skills of each of my classmates and group them according to their ability. This will allow me to provide personalized instruction to each group and help them learn at their own pace.</p><p>2.	I will provide a clear and detailed lesson plan for the dance routine that we will be performing, breaking down each step and movement into manageable chunks that my classmates can easily follow and learn. I will also make sure to incorporate fun and engaging activities into the lesson plan to keep my classmates motivated and interested in learning.</p><p>3.	I will be patient and understanding with my classmates, especially those who may be struggling to learn the dance steps. I will provide them with extra support and guidance, and encourage them to practice regularly in order to improve their skills.</p><p>4.	I will be flexible and open to suggestions and feedback from my classmates. I will listen to their ideas and incorporate them into the dance routine if they are feasible and will help enhance our performance.</p><p>Overall, my goal is to create a positive and inclusive learning environment for my classmates where they can feel comfortable and supported in learning how to dance, regardless of their current level of ability. I believe that by applying these strategies, we will be able to give an outstanding performance in the culminating program.</p><p></p><br />
