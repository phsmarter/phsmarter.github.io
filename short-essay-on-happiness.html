                                            Learning Task 1Directions: Read and analyze the short persuasive essay example below. Answer the questions in your notebook.Trip Down Memory Lane Sarah Bianca V. SaritaHow would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years.I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow.Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being achild also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best; so much glee and serenity.Questions:What is the sentence that shows how the author feel about the topic? 2.

Every newexperience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good or bad, each instancechanged the course that my life has taken. But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</a>

However, it is important to remember that your schooling, no matter how long it may feel, lasts for just a few short years compared to the rest of your life ahead of you. Therefore, it is better to sacrifice a little bit of fun now so that you can find happiness in later life, as you will be happier if you can do a job that you enjoy and afford to do the things you want.

Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Happiness is something which we can’t describe in words it can only be felt from someone’s expression of a smile. Likewise, happiness is a signal or identification of good and prosperous life. Happiness is very simple to feel and difficult to describe.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Happiness has nothing to do with having money. Money only covers up the unhappiness people feel. It doesn’t heal it. Ever. </p><p></p><p>So you can be super-wealthy and super-sad, super-broken, super-angry, super-worried, super-fearful, etc.People who have little or next-to-nothing (billions of them around the world, in fact) have found they can be happy because they have enough.

And that hits me so hard. Maybe we can have a thousands of money, but if that becomes a reason for not knowing who He is, we can have a poor soul.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Man's loves, griefs, thoughts, dreams, and aspirations written in beautiful language are literature.</p><p></p><p>2. The expression of feelings through literature may be through love, sorrow, happiness, hate, anger, pity, contempt, or revenge.</p><p></p><p>3.Another meaning of literature would be "an expression of feelings and emotions of people in response to their everyday efforts to live, to be happy in their environment, and after struggles, reach their Creator."</p><p></p><p>4.Prose includes novels, biographies, short stories, contemporary dramas, legends, fables, essays, anecdotes, news, and speeches.</p><p></p><p>5.There are three types of poetry: narrative, lyric, and dramatic.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.The original sentence used "dream" and "aspiration" in different grammatical forms than the other listed items, which made the sentence unparallel. To make it parallel, we changed "dream" to "dreams" and "aspiration" to "aspirations" so that all the items are in the same grammatical form.</p><p>2.The original sentence listed "sorrow" and "hate" as nouns, but used "happy" as an adjective, which made the sentence unparallel. To make it parallel, we changed "happy" to "happiness" to make it a noun, like the other listed items.</p><p>3.The original sentence used "his" to refer to people, which is not gender-neutral. To make it more inclusive, we changed "his" to "their." Additionally, "reach" was in a different tense than the other verbs listed, so we changed it to "reach" to match the others.</p><p>4.The original sentence used "biography" and "short story" in singular form, but used "contemporary dramas," "legends," "fables," "essays," "anecdotes," "news," and "speech" in plural form, which made the sentence unparallel. To make it parallel, we changed "biography" to "biographies" and "short story" to "short stories" to match the others.</p><p>5.The original sentence used "drama" instead of "dramatic," which was not parallel to "narrative" and "lyric," which are both adjectives. To make it parallel, we changed "drama" to "dramatic," which is an adjective like the others.</p><br />

SaritaHow would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years.I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow.Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being achild also means forgiving and forgetting.

But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending.

Are rich people really happy because they have everything? Are poor people really sad because they don't have anything? Explain. your answer.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:1.Socioeconomic status is the position of an individual or group on the socioeconomic scale, which is determined by a combination of social and economic factors such as income, amount and kind of education, type and prestige of occupation, place of residence, and—in some societies or parts of society—ethnic origin or ... 2.iin fact, new research shows that richer and poorer people are generally as happy as each other. Where they differ is in their level of sadness: higher-income individuals are markedly less sad on a daily basis.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: Thanks</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. There are various ways to identify the economic status of one's family. Here are some common methods:</p><p></p><p>Income: One of the most common indicators of economic status is income. Income can be determined by looking at the amount of money that a family earns from various sources such as salaries, wages, bonuses, and investments.</p><p></p><p>Education: Education can also be a good indicator of economic status. Families with higher levels of education tend to have higher paying jobs and better access to resources.</p><p></p><p>Occupation: The occupation of the head of the household or the primary breadwinner can also give an indication of economic status. Certain occupations such as doctors, lawyers, and engineers tend to have higher incomes than others.</p><p></p><p>Assets: The assets that a family owns can also provide an indication of economic status. Assets may include real estate, vehicles, stocks, bonds, and other investments.</p><p></p><p>Living conditions: The living conditions of a family can also give an indication of economic status. Families living in larger houses or in expensive neighborhoods may have a higher economic status.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that these indicators should not be used in isolation and should be considered together to get a more accurate picture of a family's economic status.</p><p></p><p>2. The relationship between wealth and happiness is complex and not straightforward. While it is true that having a certain level of financial security can alleviate some of the stresses and anxieties associated with poverty, it does not necessarily guarantee happiness.</p><p></p><p>Research has shown that once basic needs are met, such as food, shelter, and safety, additional wealth has diminishing returns in terms of happiness. This means that beyond a certain point, having more money does not necessarily lead to greater happiness. In fact, studies have shown that some extremely wealthy individuals experience higher levels of anxiety, stress, and depression than their less affluent counterparts.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, being poor can certainly contribute to a sense of sadness, stress, and uncertainty, as financial struggles can make it difficult to meet basic needs and achieve long-term goals. However, many individuals who are living in poverty still find joy and contentment in their lives, as they may have strong relationships, a sense of purpose, and a deep appreciation for the simple things in life.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, happiness is a complex and multifaceted emotion that is influenced by a wide range of factors, including personal values, life circumstances, and social support. While wealth can contribute to happiness in certain ways, it is by no means a guarantee, and individuals who are living in poverty can still find meaning and fulfillment in their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.   Keep expectations realistic. No one can be everything we might want them to be. Healthy relationships mean accepting people as they are and not trying to change them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.   Talk with each other. It can't be said enough: communication is essential to healthy relationships.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Take the time. Really be there.</p><p></p><p>Genuinely listen.  Do not interrupt or plan what you’re going to say next.  Try to fully understand their perspective.</p><p></p><p>Ask questions.  Show you are interested.  Ask about their experiences, feelings, opinions, and interests.</p><p></p><p>Share information.  Studies show that sharing information helps relationships begin.  Let people know who you are, but don’t overwhelm with too much personal information too soon.</p><p></p><p>3.   Be flexible. It is natural to feel uneasy about changes. Healthy relationships allow for change and growth.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4.   Take care of yourself, too. Healthy relationships are mutual, with room for both people’s needs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>5.   Be dependable. If you make plans with someone, follow through.

                            15. Teenagers are forever being told that they need a good education so that they can have the career they want, but many do not listen. However, it is important to remember that your schooling, no matter how long it may feel, lasts for just a few short years compared to the rest of your life ahead of you. Therefore, it is better to sacrifice a little bit of fun now so that you can find happiness in later life, as you will be happier if you can do a job that you enjoy and afford to do the things you want.

                            16. Activity 1Directions. Write the expressions which signal causes and effects in the essay belowWhy Do People Keep Pets?manytypesWhat are pets? Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the non-material things that can make me happy is <strong>family</strong>. Family provides me with unconditional care and love rare to find fromany other place and is priceless. The family will stream of anything, be it drama, annoying siblings, overprotective parents, and poking aunts, but I will not will deny the strength from the back up the family's power . Furthermore, family acts as a sign of courage duringlife challenges and a backbone in odd and trying times; they love unconditionally. The togetherness and festivity of having moments with the family bring with it the purest form of pleasure and happiness that is undeniable.</p><p>Secondly, another source of non-material happiness is <strong>friends</strong>. Normally, friends are like a second family. One's happiness in social engagements determines the general level of happiness of the person. Social interactions, many times, begin with friends. Today, spending some quality time with a group of my buddies or friends means a lot. As much as there may not be a blood tie between my friends and I, they offer some pure form of integrity and care. Moreover, feeling myself surrounded by caring people besides family brings with it a certain form of relief</p><br />
