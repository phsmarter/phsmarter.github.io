                            2. Write an argumentative essay of controversial topics related to Christianity about Abortion with Introduction, Body, Conclusion, Overall​</h2><br />
                        <p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Abortion is a highly controversial topic in Christianity, with divergent opinions and beliefs. Some Christians believe that life begins at conception and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to murder, while others argue that it is a personal choice and that women should have the right to decide what happens to their bodies. This essay explores the argumentative issues surrounding abortion in Christianity, highlighting both sides of the debate.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>On one hand, those who oppose abortion believe that it is morally wrong to take the life of an unborn child. For Christians, life is sacred and should be protected at all costs. Many Christians argue that since life begins at conception, any deliberate termination of pregnancy is a violation of God's commandment not to kill. They believe that life is a gift from God, and no one has the right to take it away. Such people may also argue that every child has a purpose in life, and that aborting a pregnancy deprives the child of their destiny.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, supporters of abortion in Christianity argue that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the woman carrying the fetus. They believe that women have the right to make choices about their bodies, including whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. They argue that forcing women to continue unwanted pregnancies is cruel and unjust, and that it can lead to emotional and psychological distress for both the mother and the child.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, some Christians believe that there are circumstances where abortion may be necessary, such as when the mother's life is at risk, or when the fetus has severe abnormalities that would make survival after birth unlikely. In such cases, they argue that it is better to terminate the pregnancy than to allow the mother or the child to suffer.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the issue of abortion in Christianity is a highly contentious one, with valid arguments on both sides. While some Christians believe that life begins at conception and that abortion is equivalent to murder, others argue that women should have the right to make choices about their bodies. It is important to respect each other's views and opinions on this matter, and to recognize that it is often a deeply personal and emotional issue. Ultimately, Christians should strive to find common ground and work towards solutions that protect both the sanctity of life and the rights of women.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Recently, there are many controversial topics in this world, and abortion is one of them. It was not a big problem before; however, recently the number of abortions increases rapidly. In some countries abortion is legalized; nevertheless, I strongly disagree with this idea. I believe that abortion should be illegal. In this essay, I'll show my opinions why I don't agree with abortion.</p><p></p><p>First, everyone should have responsibility for their behavior. Some people think that abortion is an easy way to avoid having a baby. Therefore, they mate whenever they want. And after that, if they notice a pregnancy, they'll go to the hospital. It sounds very easy; however, it sounds that they lack responsibility for their behavior to me. Abortion means to kill a new life and to endanger a woman's body. It seems that people who have an abortion easily think the fetus is just a "thing." If they don't want to have a baby, there are ways to avoid having a baby before pregnancy. Therefore, to rely on just abortion means they don't have any responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Second, as I mentioned before, abortion is dangerous for a woman's body. Recently, many people try to have an abortion; thus, it causes misunderstanding. Abortion is not the easy way that people think. It's possible that a woman can't have a baby anymore because it hurts the woman's body. Besides, it's possible that women die because of it. Unfortunately, many people don't know the reality. From my point of view, it's because of the lack of education about abortion. The women who are pregnant don't know what abortion does to their body.</p><p></p><p>Third, the baby, whether he/she is born or not, has the right to live. Who can say that the baby has no hope? It's possible that the baby can have a better life than ours. We don't have any right to kill a newborn baby. Moreover, I think only human beings do abortion. Humans are the only animals that kill their babies intentionally.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus.An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion" and occurs in approximately 30% to 40% of pregnancies.When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Abortion, as we all know, has been used many times on innocent undevelop babies. One main reason why women would do such is first, because they aren't prepared to be a mother, second, because their partner left them and they got nothing else to supply the baby's basic needs and last one, is because they assume that the baby is a "mistake". But what they are missing is that even how many problems, trials and even "mistakes" they would make, that baby, even if you turn the world upside down, is life. It is another life. A blessing, and the joy to which you would experience upon seeing it.<br /><br />Yet why do some women or even young ladies abort such a beautiful thing? Lust is a word that can be interconnected with this matter. Some say the baby is "just a mistake" but actually the baby is not the mistake, rather, they are the ones. If they hadnt gone overboard and do things that they are still not ready yet, then why go with the flow with it? <br /><br />Carrying and delivering a baby is hard. All women know that. Experiencing pain, sorrows and everything. But after you have a life within you, why not keep it? Even if it's hard at first, at the end, all those pain and all those sufferings are worth it. Joy and laughter would definitely replaced those negative and bad emotions. You just need to endure it, ask advices too and most especially, when carrying it, fill that baby all the love you could give it. Don't just deliver and carry it for the sake of getting rid of the burden, cherish it because sooner or later, you will really regret.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion, sa aking sariling salita, ay ang pagpapalaglag sa isang sanggol sa loob ng matris ng isang babae. Sa aking opinyon, hindi ko sumasang-ayon sa ganitong paraan ng pagpapalaglag.</p><p></p><p>Ang una kong dahilan para hindi sumasang-ayon sa pagpapalaglag ay dahil ito ay nakakapinsala sa katawan ng isang babae. Sa pamamagitan ng pagpapalaglag, ang isang babae ay nakakaranas ng pisikal at emosyonal na sakit, at maaaring magdulot ng mga komplikasyon sa kalusugan sa hinaharap.</p><p></p><p>Ang isa pang dahilan kung bakit hindi ako sumasang-ayon sa pagpapalaglag ay dahil ito ay nakakapinsala sa isang buhay na sanggol. Sa aking pananaw, ang isang sanggol sa loob ng matris ay may karapatang mabuhay at magkaroon ng pagkakataon sa buhay tulad ng sinumang iba pang tao.</p><p></p><p>Sa konklusyon, hindi ako sumasang-ayon sa pagpapalaglag dahil ito ay nakakapinsala sa katawan ng isang babae at sa isang sanggol na buhay. Ang ganitong paraan ng pagpapalaglag ay hindi dapat bigyang katiyakan ng suporta at dapat ipagbawal sa ilalim ng batas. Walang sanggunian.</p><p></p><p>pa brainlist po pwede</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion is a highly controversial and sensitive issue that has been the subject of intense debate and discussion for many years. In my opinion, abortion should be legal and accessible to those who need it.</p><p></p><p>The first reason why I believe this is that everyone has the right to control their own bodies and make decisions about their own reproductive health. This includes the right to terminate a pregnancy if they choose to do so. Denying someone the right to make decisions about their own body is a violation of their personal autonomy and freedom.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why I support the right to abortion is that it is an essential component of comprehensive healthcare for women. Women who are able to access safe and legal abortion services are more likely to have healthy pregnancies and better overall health outcomes. This is particularly important for women who are facing medical complications or other adverse circumstances that make continuing a pregnancy unsafe or undesirable.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I believe that abortion should be legal and accessible to all who need it. Women have the right to control their own bodies and make decisions about their reproductive health, and access to safe and legal abortion services is an essential part of comprehensive healthcare for women.</p><p></p><p>References:</p><p></p><p>"Abortion: Your Right to Know"</p><br />

                        <p>Abortion is considered as one of the most controversial issues. It is an argument between life and death. The uncertainty of its complications makes the issue more challenging to deal with. Abortion refers to the termination of pregnancy by removing the fetus or the embryo from the uterus before it is ready to take birth.</p><p></p><p>Abortions are one of the most common methods to end a pregnancy. It is one of the safest procedures to terminate a pregnancy through medicine. An abortion that occurs without clinical intervention is known as miscarriage and occurs in almost 30% to 50% of pregnancies. Unsafe abortion can lead to maternal death; hence it is always safe to go for clinical procedures.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Why I disagree with the act of abortion.<p></p><p>Based on Word Heath Organization data, approximately there are 73 millions induced abortion happen each year globally especially in developing countries where policy, law and healthcare system still not appropriate to fulfill woman right. Russia is the country with highest number of abortion this year based on WHO. The act of abortion itself actually affected womens health, both physically and mentally. The risks are too dangerous and treathing someone's life.</p><p>I have few reasons why I disagree with this topic.</p><p><strong>The first reason</strong>, there are so many risks caused by abortion from a medical point of view. Short term or long term risk. Uterine leakage, torn uterine, massive bleeding, intra uterine fetal die, pain in the genital area to the waist, and can even afffect other organs are the short term effects of abortion. While the examples of long-term risks are miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies, breast cancer (due to an imbalance of the hormone estrogen in women), cervical cancer (cervical cancer), being unable to get pregnant again (infertility) because there is an infected part of the uterus, premature birth in the next pregnancy , inflammation in the pelvis and can even cause death. </p><p><strong>The second reason</strong> is from the psychological perspective. Just like pyshical condition, mental condition are also important. Abortion can lead to  "Post-Abortion Syndrome" or PAS. These symptoms are noted in "Psychological Reactions Reported After Abortion". Basically, a woman who has an abortion will experience things such as loss of self-esteem, screaming hysterically, having nightmare about her baby, wanting to commit suicide, started trying to use illegal drugs, can no longer enjoy sexual intercourse and is overcome with feelings of guilt that do not go away for many years of their life. This condition, will negatively affect their life quality in general. Woman can no longer do their function as individual or part of society. And it should become a concern to govenment.</p><p>Because of these massive effect caused by this act, I think its safe to not allowing the act of abortion. Woman needs to be protected mentally and physically. And choosing abortion is not an option.</p><p></p><p>Reference </p><p>WHO - Abortion Rates by country. https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/abortion-rates-by-country</p><p></p><p>Check this for more information and further reading about abortion https://brainly.ph/question/17349900?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The misunderstanding arises from the fact that, contrary to popular belief, the prevalence of contraception and the incidence of induced abortion can and often do increase in lockstep within specific populations. These counterintuitive trends have a simple explanation. 2 In cultures where the fertility process has not yet occurred, real fertility as well as ideal family sizes are also high (or, to put it another way, childbearing is not yet considered to be "within the calculus of conscious choice"3). Couples in such communities have a low (or no) chance of unintended pregnancies. High (or "fatalistic") reproductive desires have been destabilized since the introduction of modern contraceptives. As contraception use becomes more widespread and fertility continues to decrease, a rising number of couples want no more children (or want to wait a long time before having another), raising the risk of unintended pregnancy. When it comes to fertility change, the early and middle stages are crucial. couples who want to delay or restrict childbearing still have a long way to go in terms of adopting and maintaining successful contraceptive methods. As a result, the increasing demand for contraception may outstrip availability;4 as a result, the number of unintended and unwanted pregnancies increases, fueling an increase in unwanted live births and induced abortions. Contraceptive use and induced abortion can increase at the same time in this scenario.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Make your own essay next time.</p><br />

                        <p>NO, Because Divorce has been seen to have a negative effect on the children involved, especially during the transition period as they deal with the separation of their parents. This may manifest in various ways such as diminished social skills, proneness to anger and increased irritability.Divorce also does not safeguard or promote the mental and physical health of children as it is difficult to cope with one’s problems when one’s family, their main support system, is broken apart.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the divorce may influence the child into losing faith in the concept of a family entirely, which leads to another negative effect of this process. If divorce were to be legalized, it would amplify the mentality that marriage can be easily broken, which may result in people putting less effort into making it last and ensuring that they will pick the right partner. The family is thus put into danger and further exposed to the risk of breaking apart.</p><p></p><p>Abortion should not be legalized in the Philippines for it is a painful surgery. Despite the use of such anesthetics, Almost 97% of women that committed abortions have been reported experiencing extreme pain during the procedure. Compared to other pains, researchers have rated the pain from abortion as more afflictive than a bone fracture, about the same as cancer pain. The use of more powerful general anesthetics can reduce the pain, but it increases the risk of cervical injury. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>sana makatulong </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion has been legal in the United States since 1973 (MacKinnon,2018). Despite the legality, both pro-lifers and pro-choice advocates have stood on opposite ends of the issue. Those who are passionate about either side have valid points to the moral issue at hand. What this really boils down to is who has more rights-the women who wants to decide for herself when she wants to reproduce or the unborn fetus? The fetus does not have a voice; therefore, pro-lifers speak for them. Pro-life advocates stress that termination should never be an option. </p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps pa brainly po</p><p>#CARRY_ON_LEARNING</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>Abortion is a highly controversial topic that has been the subject of much debate and discussion over the years. It is the termination of a pregnancy before the fetus is viable outside the womb, either through medical procedures or natural means. While some people believe that abortion should be legal and easily accessible, others believe that it is morally wrong and should be illegal. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the debate and discuss the ethical and moral implications of abortion.</p><p></p><p>Those who support legalizing abortion argue that it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. They argue that a woman should have the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term, especially in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's health is in danger. Additionally, they point out that outlawing abortion does not prevent it from happening, but rather drives it underground, putting women's health and safety at risk.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, opponents of abortion argue that it is morally wrong to end a human life, and that the fetus has the same rights as any other human being. They argue that abortion is a form of murder and should be illegal in all cases. Some also argue that there are alternative options, such as adoption, for women who do not want to raise a child.</p><p></p><p>The debate over abortion often centers around the question of when life begins. Some argue that life begins at conception, while others believe that it begins at birth or at some point in between. This is a difficult question to answer, as it is subjective and depends on one's personal beliefs and values.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the legal and political implications of abortion, there are different approaches taken by different countries. Some countries, such as the United States, have legalized abortion but have placed restrictions on it, such as requiring parental consent for minors or prohibiting late-term abortions. Other countries, such as Ireland, have only recently legalized abortion after years of strict bans.</p><p></p><p>From an ethical perspective, the debate over abortion raises important questions about the value of life, the rights of women, and the role of government in regulating personal choices. It is important to consider the various perspectives on this issue and to engage in constructive dialogue that seeks to find common ground and respect for different viewpoints.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the topic of abortion is complex and controversial, with strong arguments on both sides. While it is important to respect differing opinions, it is also important to consider the ethical and moral implications of this issue. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to legalize abortion is one that must be made by society as a whole, taking into account the values, beliefs, and needs of all individuals involved.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>paki-brainliest po, atsaka i summarize mo na din.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus.[note 1] An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion.[1][2] A similar procedure after the fetus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a "late termination of pregnancy" or less accurately as a "late term abortion".[3]
</p><p>
</p><p>When allowed by law and performed by trained personnel, abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine.[4][5] It is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term, which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the United States.[6][7] Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions.[8] The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy.[8][9] The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device.[10] Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion.[9] When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems.[11] In contrast, unsafe abortions (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year.[11][12] The World Health Organization recommends safe and legal abortions be available to all women.[13]
</p><p>
</p><p>Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world,[14] with about 45% done unsafely.[15] Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008,[16] before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased.[17] As of 2008, 40% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason.[18] Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed.[18]
</p><p>
</p><p>Historically, abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines, sharp tools, forceful massage, or through other traditional methods.[19] Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest.[20] There is debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion.[21][22] Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life, and so they may compare abortion to murder.[23][24] Those who favor the legality of abortion often hold that it is part of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body.[25] Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure.[26]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Tips are provided on how to write an argumentative essay on abortion
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you are going to write an argumentative essay on abortion, you need to be able to present compelling arguments and data to support them.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>An argumentative essay is where a student presents both side of a given situation. You will need to investigate, collect data, present them and establish your own position on the matter.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So on the matter of abortion there will be two sides:  pro and against. But first define what abortion is and research on Philippine laws covering abortion.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Are we allowed to have it?
</strong></p><p><strong>Are there abortion clinics here like they have in the USA? What happens to woman if they have an abortion?
</strong></p><p><strong>How many babies are aborted every day?
</strong></p><p><strong>These are some of the preliminary questions you need to know.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Now, after establishing the scenario, you need to take a stand, whether you are for it or against it. If for it, what arguments will you use? You could probably cite that a woman's body belong to her so it is her right. If you are against, you can probably argue that abortion is the same as killing a child, hence immoral and illegal.

                        <p>Abortion is a highly controversial issue that has been debated for many years. It refers to the termination of a pregnancy through medical or surgical means. The debate on abortion primarily revolves around the question of whether it is ethically justifiable to end the life of a developing fetus.</p><p>On one hand, proponents of abortion argue that a woman has the right to control her own body and make decisions about her reproductive health. They argue that a woman should have the freedom to choose whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term, depending on her individual circumstances.</p><p>On the other hand, opponents of abortion argue that human life begins at conception, and therefore, abortion is equivalent to taking a life. They argue that the fetus has a right to life, and that ending a pregnancy is a violation of that right.</p><p>The debate on abortion is further complicated by the fact that there are different types of abortion procedures, each with its own ethical implications. Some procedures are performed early in the pregnancy, while others are performed later, when the fetus is more developed.</p><p>In conclusion, the issue of abortion is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, it is up to individuals and society as a whole to determine where they stand on the issue and how to address it in a way that balances the rights of the woman and the developing fetus.</p><br />
