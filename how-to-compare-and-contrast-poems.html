Here and there and all around,
Left and right, even on the ground,
Things to see, stuff to learn,
For information, we always yearn.
Students like you are very curious,
In processing thoughts, you are serious.
At home, in school, and in the community,
Whatever you learn, becomes so handy.Information sources, as wide as a meadow,
There are several choices, I tell you so.
Article, journal, dictionary, and book,
Photograph, radio, your TV in the nook
Nowadays, it’s even made easier,
To gather data just by sitting there.
Websites, applications, and social media,
Almost everything is in Britannica. 
Information galore, wonderful to explore,
Examine, analyze, then what’s more?
Judge, review, don’t take them up easily,
Scan for errors and biases diligently.
Compare the contents, are they reliable?
Are the details substantial, not just trivial?
Proofs we need in contrasting statements,
Are they for promotion or just entertainment?
For information might be right or wrong,
Agreeing easily and going along,
A big no-no, you must remember.
In selecting sources, you’ve got to do better

In processing thoughts, you are serious.
At home, in school, and in the community,
Whatever you learn, becomes so handy.Information sources, as wide as a meadow,
There are several choices, I tell you so.

Photograph, radio, your TV in the nook
Nowadays, it’s even made easier,
To gather data just by sitting there.

Examine, analyze, then what’s more?
Judge, review, don’t take them up easily,
Scan for errors and biases diligently.

Are the details substantial, not just trivial?
Proofs we need in contrasting statements,
Are they for promotion or just entertainment?

2. According to William Shakespeare’s Seven Ages of man, men go through seven stages in their lives. In
connection to the optional intertextuality compare and contrast the poem written by William
Shakespeare titled “The Seven Ages of man” to the bible’s seven day of creation. Analyze the different
events occur in both literary texts.
https://www.thoughtco.com/shakespeares-seven-ages-of-man-2831433</h2><br />
                        <p>The poems "A passionate shepherd to his love" and "The nymph reply to the shepherd" both deal with the theme of love and the passage of time. In the first poem, the shepherd begs his love to come away with him and live a life of simple pleasures and joys, promising her all manner of worldly delights. In the second poem, the nymph replies to the shepherd, telling him that she cannot go with him because the fleeting nature of life and the inevitability of death make it impossible for her to leave her home and follow him.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the conventions of obligatory intertextuality, both poems make reference to other literary works. For example, the shepherd's promise to his love to "build a little stately palace" and "live and love" within it echoes the works of classical poets such as Virgil and Ovid, who often wrote about the idyllic rural lifestyles of shepherds and nymphs. Similarly, the nymph's reference to the "death's second self" and the "end of all earthly things" echoes the conventions of Elizabethan poetry, which often dealt with themes of mortality and the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>In terms of optional intertextuality, the poem "The Seven Ages of Man" by William Shakespeare can be compared and contrasted with the biblical story of the seven days of creation. Both works deal with the passage of time and the stages of life, but they approach these themes in different ways. In Shakespeare's poem, the seven ages of man are presented as a series of successive stages, each with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges. In contrast, the story of the seven days of creation presents the events of the world's creation as a series of discrete and distinct acts, each with its own unique significance. Despite these differences, both works explore the idea that life is a journey and that each stage of life presents its own challenges and opportunities.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"The Lamb" and "The Tiger" are two poems written by William Blake that explore the theme of good and evil. Both poems present an animal as a symbol for certain moral qualities, with the lamb representing innocence and the tiger representing power and ferocity.</p><p></p><p>One key difference between the two poems is the tone used to describe each animal. "The Lamb" takes a gentle, nurturing tone, with the speaker asking the lamb questions and describing it as a peaceful and innocent creature. "The Tiger," on the other hand, takes a more fearful and awe-inspiring tone, with the speaker describing the tiger's strength and majesty as well as the destructive power of its flames.</p><p></p><p>Despite these differences in tone, both poems ultimately present the animals as symbols for good and evil. The lamb represents the good qualities of innocence, purity, and gentleness, while the tiger represents the evil qualities of power, ferocity, and destruction. In this way, the poems explore the theme of good and evil by contrasting the opposing moral qualities represented by the lamb and the tiger</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"The Lamb" and "The Tiger" are two poems by William Blake that explore the theme of good and evil. Both poems present the animals as symbols of these opposing forces, with the lamb representing innocence and goodness, and the tiger representing ferocity and violence.</p><p></p><p>One of the main similarities between these poems is that they both use the animals as symbols to represent larger ideas. In "The Lamb," the lamb is a symbol of innocence and goodness, and its simplicity and vulnerability are used to evoke feelings of compassion and tenderness in the reader. In "The Tiger," the tiger is a symbol of ferocity and violence, and its power and majesty are used to evoke feelings of awe and fear in the reader.</p><p></p><p>One of the main differences between these poems is the way in which the animals are described. In "The Lamb," the lamb is described in gentle, soothing terms, as a "meek and mild" creature that is "like a child" and "innocent and sweet." In contrast, "The Tiger" is described in more ominous and fearful terms, as a "fearful symmetry" with "fierce" eyes and a "deadly" grasp. This contrast between the gentle, nurturing language of "The Lamb" and the fierce, menacing language of "The Tiger" reflects the theme of good and evil in the poems.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the similarities and differences between "The Lamb" and "The Tiger" are related to the theme of good and evil in that they both use the animals as symbols to represent these opposing forces, and they describe the animals in ways that reflect their symbolic roles.</p><p></p><br />

Are there rhymes? Is there a certain rhythm? How does the presence or absence of  rhyme and rhythm help convey the message of the text? What imagery was used in the poem?   What is the mood of the poem? Did the use of language help in conveying the poem’s message? How? Compare and contrast the expressions of love during the time of Rizal and the present time. How does distance and the setting affect the language conveyed in one's literary work ​</h2><br />
                        The poem does not have a consistent rhyme scheme, although there are some end rhymes, such as "came/home" and "nest/swallows". There is also a rhythmic quality to the poem, with a steady meter and use of repetition ("To Shanghai, China, or Japan"). The presence of rhyme and rhythm helps to create a musical quality to the poem, making it more memorable and emphasizing the emotional message being conveyed.The poem uses the imagery of swallows and hearts to convey the themes of migration, home, and love. The comparison of the speaker to a wandering swallow highlights the commonality of human migration across borders and the desire for a home or nest. The image of a beating heart represents the emotional connection between people, even across great distances.The mood of the poem is one of longing and affection. The speaker is expressing their love and concern for Josephine, who has left her home in search of a new one. The poem conveys a sense of empathy and understanding towards those who must leave their homes behind.The use of language in the poem helps to convey the emotional message by using simple, direct language that is easy to understand. The repetition of the phrase "on these shores" emphasizes the speaker's affection for Josephine and their desire to make her feel welcomed and loved. The poem also uses imagery and metaphor to convey complex emotions in a simple and relatable way.Expressions of love during Rizal's time often used formal language and elaborate metaphors, while modern expressions of love tend to be more direct and personal. The use of distance and setting can affect the language used in literary works by creating a sense of nostalgia, longing, or detachment. In the case of this poem, the distance between Josephine and the speaker creates a sense of longing and concern, while the setting of the "shores" emphasizes the speaker's desire to create a new home for Josephine.<br />
